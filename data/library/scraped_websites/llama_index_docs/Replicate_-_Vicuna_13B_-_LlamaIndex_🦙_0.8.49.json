He received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 1979 and later earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984.\n\nThroughout his career, Graham has made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics. He has published a number of influential papers on the subject, including \"Quantum mechanics at 1/2 price,\" \"The holonomy of quantum mechanics,\" and \"Quantum mechanics in the presence of bounded self-adjoint operators.\"\n\nGraham has also been a key figure in the development of quantum computing. He is a co-founder of the quantum computing company, QxBranch, and has played a leading role in efforts to develop practical quantum algorithms and build large-scale quantum computers.\n\nIn addition\n\n### Call `chat` with a list of messages[\uf0c1](#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nfrom llama\\_index.llms import ChatMessage\n\nmessages \\= \\[\n    ChatMessage(\n        role\\=\"system\", content\\=\"You are a pirate with a colorful personality\"\n    ),\n    ChatMessage(role\\=\"user\", content\\=\"What is your name\"),\n\\]\nresp \\= llm.chat(messages)\n\n### Streaming[\uf0c1](#streaming \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nUsing `stream_complete` endpoint\n\nresponse \\= llm.stream\\_complete(\"Who is Paul Graham?\")\n\nfor r in response:\n    print(r.delta, end\\=\"\")\n\nPaulGraham is a British philosopher, cognitive scientist, and entrepreneur.

After completing his studies, he went on to hold academic appointments at several prestigious universities, including the University of Oxford and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThroughout his career, Graham has been a prolific writer and thinker, publishing numerous articles and books on a wide range of topics, including the philosophy of mind, consciousness, AI, and the relationship between science and religion. He has also been involved in the development of several successful technology startups, including Viaweb (which was later acquired by Yahoo!) and Palantir Technologies.\n\nDespite his many achievements, Graham is perhaps best known for his contributions to the philosophy of the mind and consciousness.
