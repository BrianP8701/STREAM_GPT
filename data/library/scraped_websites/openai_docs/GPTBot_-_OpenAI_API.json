Allowing GPTBot to access your site can help AI models become more accurate and improve their general capabilities and safety. Below, we also share how to disallow GPTBot from accessing your site.\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/disallowing-gptbot)\n\n### [Disallowing GPTBot](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/disallowing-gptbot)\n\nTo disallow GPTBot to access your site you can add the GPTBot to your site\u2019s robots.txt:\n\n```\nUser-agent: GPTBot\nDisallow: /\n```\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/customize-gptbot-access)\n\n### [Customize GPTBot access](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/customize-gptbot-access)\n\nTo allow GPTBot to access only parts of your site you can add the GPTBot token to your site\u2019s robots.txt like this:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\nUser-agent: GPTBot\nAllow: /directory-1/\nDisallow: /directory-2/\n```\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/gptbot-and-chatgpt-user)\n\n### [GPTBot and ChatGPT-User](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/gptbot-and-chatgpt-user)\n\nOpenAI has two separate user agents for web crawling and user browsing, so you know which use-case a given request is for. Our opt-out system currently treats both user agents the same, so any robots.txt disallow for one agent will cover both. [Read more about ChatGPT-User here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot).\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/ip-egress-ranges)\n\n### [IP egress ranges](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot/ip-egress-ranges)\n\nFor OpenAI's crawler, calls to websites will be made from the IP address block documented on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/gptbot.json)."
