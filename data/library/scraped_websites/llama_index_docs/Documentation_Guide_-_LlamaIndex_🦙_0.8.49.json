LlamaIndex is made by the thriving community behind it, and you\u2019re always welcome to make contributions to the project and the documentation.\n\n## Build Docs[\uf0c1](#build-docs \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, clone the LlamaIndex Github repo to a local directory:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama\\_index.git && cd llama\\_index\n\nInstall all dependencies required for building docs (mainly `sphinx` and its extension):\n\n*   [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) - this will help you manage package dependencies\n    \n*   `poetry shell` - this command creates a virtual environment, which keeps installed packages contained to this project\n    \n*   `poetry install --with docs` - this will install all dependencies needed for building docs\n    \n\nBuild the sphinx docs:\n\nThe docs HTML files are now generated under `docs/_build/html` directory, you can preview it locally with the following command:\n\npython \\-m http.server 8000 \\-d \\_build/html\n\nAnd open your browser at [http://0.0.0.0:8000/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/) to view the generated docs.\n\n### Watch Docs[\uf0c1](#watch-docs \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nWe recommend using sphinx-autobuild during development, which provides a live-reloading server, that rebuilds the documentation and refreshes any open pages automatically when changes are saved. This enables a much shorter feedback loop which can help boost productivity when writing documentation.\n\nSimply run the following command from LlamaIndex project\u2019s root directory:"
