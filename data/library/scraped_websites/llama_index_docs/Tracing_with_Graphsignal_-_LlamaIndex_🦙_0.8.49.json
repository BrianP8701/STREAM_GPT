It helps developers ensure AI applications run as expected and users have the best experience.\n\nGraphsignal **automatically** traces and monitors LlamaIndex. Traces and metrics provide execution details for query, retrieval, and index operations. These insights include **prompts**, **completions**, **embedding statistics**, **retrieved nodes**, **parameters**, **latency**, and **exceptions**.\n\nWhen OpenAI APIs are used, Graphsignal provides additional insights such as **token counts** and **costs** per deployment, model or any context.\n\n## Installation and Setup[\uf0c1](#installation-and-setup \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nAdding [Graphsignal tracer](https://github.com/graphsignal/graphsignal-python) is simple, just install and configure it:\n\nimport graphsignal\n\n\\# Provide an API key directly or via GRAPHSIGNAL\\_API\\_KEY environment variable\ngraphsignal.configure(api\\_key\\='my-api-key', deployment\\='my-llama-index-app-prod')\n\nYou can get an API key [here](https://app.graphsignal.com/).\n\nSee the [Quick Start guide](https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/quick-start/), [Integration guide](https://graphsignal.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/), and an [example app](https://github.com/graphsignal/examples/blob/main/llama-index-app/main.py) for more information.\n\n## Tracing Other Functions[\uf0c1](#tracing-other-functions \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nTo additionally trace any function or code, you can use a decorator or a context manager:\n\nwith graphsignal.start\\_trace('load-external-data'):\n    reader.load\\_data()\n\nSee [Python API Reference](https://graphsignal.com/docs/reference/python-api/) for complete instructions.\n\n## Useful Links[\uf0c1](#useful-links \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\n*   [Tracing and Monitoring LlamaIndex Applications](https://graphsignal.com/blog/tracing-and-monitoring-llama-index-applications/)\n    \n*   [Monitor OpenAI API Latency, Tokens, Rate Limits, and More](https://graphsignal.com/blog/monitor-open-ai-api-latency-tokens-rate-limits-and-more/)\n    \n*   [OpenAI API Cost Tracking: Analyzing Expenses by Model, Deployment, and Context](https://graphsignal.com/blog/open-ai-api-cost-tracking-analyzing-expenses-by-model-deployment-and-context/)"
