It\u2019s not connected to the real world, data, or other digital applications.\n\nIt is important to be able to monitor, track and improve against quality issues.\n\n## Tradeoffs in LLM Application Development[\uf0c1](#tradeoffs-in-llm-application-development \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nThere are a few tradeoffs in LLM application development:\n\n1.  **Cost** - more powerful models may be more expensive\n    \n2.  **Latency** - more powerful models may be slower\n    \n3.  **Simplicity** (one size fits all) - how powerful and flexible is the model / pipeline?\n    \n4.  **Reliability / Usability** - is my application working at least in the general case? Is it ready for unstructured user interaction? Have I covered the major usage patterns?\n    \n\nLLM infra improvements are progressing quickly and we expect cost and latency to go down over time.\n\nHere are some additional concerns:\n\n1.  **Evaluation** - Once I start diving deeper into improving quality, how can I evaluate individual components? How can I keep track of issues and track whether / how they are being improved over time as I change my application?\n    \n2.  **Data-Driven** - How can I automate more of my evaluation and iteration process? How do I start small and add useful data points over time? How can I organize different datasets and metrics which serve different purposes? How can I manage the complexity while keeping track of my guiding light of providing the best user experience?\n    \n3.  **Customization / Complexity Tradeoff** - How do I improve each stage of the pipeline - preprocessing and feature extraction, retrieval, generation? Does this involve adding additional structure or processing? How can I break down this goal into more measurable and trackable sub-goals?\n    \n\nDifferences between **Evaluation** and being **Data-Driven**:\n\n1.  **Evaluation** does not necessarily have to be rigorous or fully data-driven process - especially at the initial stages. It is more concerned with the initial _development_ phase of the application - validating that the overall pipeline works in the general case and starting to define possible signals and metrics which may be carried forward into production.\n    \n2.  Being **Data-Driven** is closely tied to _automation_. After we\u2019ve chosen our basic application structure, how can we improve the system over time? How can we ensure quality in a systematic way? How can we reduce the cost of monitoring, and what are the pathways to adding and curating data points? How can we leverage ML systems (including but not limited to LLMs) to make this process easier?\n    \n\nAdditional considerations:\n\n1.  **Privacy** - how can I ensure that my data is not leaked if I am feeding it into these models? What infrastructure am I using and what is the security guarantee / how is the access control structured?\n    \n\n## Development Hurdles[\uf0c1](#development-hurdles \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nHere are some potential problems you may encounter when developing your LLM application which may lead to unsatisfactory results.\n\n### Retrieval[\uf0c1](#retrieval \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\n1.  **Out of Domain:** If your data is extremely specific (medical, legal, scientific, financial, or other documents with technical lingo), it may be worth: - trying out alternate embeddings - Check the [MTEB Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) - You may configure a local embedding model with the steps here - testing out fine-tuning of embeddings - Tools: [setfit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) - Anecdotally, we have seen retrieval accuracy improve by ~12% by curating a small annotated dataset from production data - Even synthetic data generation without human labels has been shown to improve retrieval metrics across similar documents in train / val sets. - More detailed guides and case studies will come soon. - testing out sparse retrieval methods (see ColBERT, SPLADE) - these methods have been shown to generalize well to out of domain data - that are starting to be available in some enterprise systems (e.g. [Elastic Search\u2019s ELSeR](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html)) - checking out our [evaluation principles guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/end_to_end_tutorials/dev_practices/evaluation.html#evaluation) on how you might evaluate the above changes"
