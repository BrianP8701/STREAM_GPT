Since it _always_ queries the knowledge base, it can have difficulty answering meta questions like \u201cwhat did I ask you before?\u201d\n\n## Get started in 5 lines of code[\uf0c1](#get-started-in-5-lines-of-code \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nLoad data and build index\n\nfrom llama\\_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n\ndata \\= SimpleDirectoryReader(input\\_dir\\=\"../data/paul\\_graham/\").load\\_data()\nindex \\= VectorStoreIndex.from\\_documents(data)\n\nConfigure chat engine\n\nchat\\_engine \\= index.as\\_chat\\_engine(chat\\_mode\\=\"condense\\_question\", verbose\\=True)\n\nChat with your data\n\nresponse \\= chat\\_engine.chat(\"What did Paul Graham do after YC?\")\n\nQuerying with: What was the next step in Paul Graham's career after his involvement with Y Combinator?\n\nPaul Graham's next step in his career after his involvement with Y Combinator was to take up painting. He spent most of the rest of 2014 painting and then in March 2015 he started working on Lisp again.\n\nAsk a follow up question\n\nresponse \\= chat\\_engine.chat(\"What about after that?\")\n\nQuerying with: What did Paul Graham do after he started working on Lisp again in March 2015?\n\nPaul Graham spent the rest of 2015 writing essays and working on his new dialect of Lisp, which he called Arc.

He also resumes his old life in New York, now that he is rich. He is able to take taxis and eat in restaurants, which is exciting for a while. He also starts to make connections with other people who are trying to paint in New York.\n\n## Streaming Support[\uf0c1](#streaming-support \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nfrom llama\\_index import ServiceContext, VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\nfrom llama\\_index.llms import OpenAI\n\nservice\\_context \\= ServiceContext.from\\_defaults(\n    llm\\=OpenAI(model\\=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature\\=0)\n)\n\ndata \\= SimpleDirectoryReader(input\\_dir\\=\"../data/paul\\_graham/\").load\\_data()\n\nindex \\= VectorStoreIndex.from\\_documents(data, service\\_context\\=service\\_context)\n\nchat\\_engine \\= index.as\\_chat\\_engine(chat\\_mode\\=\"condense\\_question\", verbose\\=True)\n\nresponse \\= chat\\_engine.stream\\_chat(\"What did Paul Graham do after YC?\")\nfor token in response.response\\_gen:\n    print(token, end\\=\"\")\n\nQuerying with: What did Paul Graham do after leaving YC?\nAfter leaving YC, Paul Graham started painting and focused on improving his skills in that area.
