Among\nthe savage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to\nwork,ismoreorlessemployedinusefullabour,andendeavourstoprovide,\nas well as he can, the necessaries and conveniences of life, for himself,\nor such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or too\ninfirmtogoahuntingandfishing.

Among civilised and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a\ngreat number of people do not labour at all, many of whom consume the\nproduce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labour than the\ngreaterpartofthosewhowork;yettheproduceofthewholelabourofthe\nsocietyissogreatthatallareoftenabundantlysupplied,andaworkman,\neven of the lowest and poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may\nenjoyagreatershareofthenecessariesandconveniencesoflifethanitis\npossibleforanysavagetoacquire.\n7 [5] Thecausesofthisimprovement,intheproductivepowersoflabour,and G.ed.p11\nthe order, according to which its produce is naturally distributed among\nthe different ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject\noftheFirstBookofthisInquiry.", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n8 [6] Whateverbetheactualstateoftheskill,dexterity,andjudgmentwith\nwhich labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its\nannual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon\nthe proportion between the number of those who are annually employed\nin useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed.

The policy of some nations has\ngivenextraordinaryencouragementtotheindustryofthecountry;thatof\nothers to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has dealt equally and\nimpartially with every sort of industry. Since the downfall of the Roman\nempire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufac-\ntures, and commerce, the industry of towns; than to agriculture, the in-\ndustry of the country. The circumstances which seem to have introduced\nandestablishedthispolicyareexplainedintheThirdBook.\n10 [8] Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the\nprivate interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any\nregard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare\nof the society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of\npolitical\u0153conomy;ofwhichsomemagnifytheimportanceofthatindustry\nwhichiscarriedonintowns,othersofthatwhichiscarriedoninthecoun-\ntry. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon the\nopinionsofmenoflearning,butuponthepublicconductofprincesandsov-\nereignstates. Ihaveendeavoured,intheFourthBook,toexplain,asfully\nand distinctly as I can, those different theories, and the principal effects\nwhichtheyhaveproducedindifferentagesandnations.\n[9] To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the\n11\npeople, or what has been the nature of those funds which, in different\nagesandnations,havesuppliedtheirannualconsumption,istheobjectof\ntheseFourfirstBooks.

In this Book I have endeavoured to show;\nfirst,whatarethenecessaryexpensesofthesovereign,orcommonwealth;\nwhich of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution\nof the whole society; and which of them by that of some particular part\nonly, or of some particular members of it; secondly, what are the different\nmethods in which the whole society may be made to contribute towards\ndefraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society, and what are the\n5", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nprincipal advantages and inconveniences of each of those methods: and,\nthirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes which have induced\nalmostallmoderngovernmentstomortgagesomepartofthisrevenue, or\nto contract debts, and what have been the effects of those debts upon the\nrealwealth,theannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthesociety.\n6", "Book I\nG.ed.p13\nOf The Causes of Improvement in the\nProductive Powers of Labour, and of\nthe Order According to which Its\nProduce Is Naturally Distributed Among\nthe Different Ranks of the People", "CHAPTER I\nOF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR\n[1] THE greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the\n12\ngreaterpartoftheskill,dexterity,andjudgmentwithwhichitisanywhere\ndirected,orapplied,seemtohavebeentheeffectsofthedivisionoflabour.\n13 [2] The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of soci- G.ed.p14\nety, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it op-\nerates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be\ncarried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is\ncarried further in them than in others of more importance: but in those\ntriflingmanufactureswhicharedestinedtosupplythesmallwantsofbut\nasmallnumberofpeople,thewholenumberofworkmenmustnecessarily\nbe small; and those employed in every different branch of the work can\noften be collected into the same workhouse, and placed at once under the\nviewofthespectator. Inthosegreatmanufactures,onthecontrary,which\nare destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people,\neverydifferentbranchoftheworkemployssogreatanumberofworkmen\nthat it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can\nseldom see more, at one time, than those employed in one single branch.\nThough in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided\nintoamuchgreaternumberofpartsthaninthoseofamoretriflingnature,\nthedivisionisnotnearsoobvious,andhasaccordinglybeenmuchlessob-\nserved.\n[3] To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but\n14\noneinwhichthedivisionoflabourhasbeenveryoftentakennoticeof,the\ntrade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which\nthe division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with\nthe use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the\nsame division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, per-\nhaps,withhisutmostindustry,makeonepininaday,andcertainlycould\nnotmaketwenty. Butinthewayinwhichthisbusinessisnowcarriedon,\nnot only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a num-\nber of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. G.ed.p15\nOnemandrawsoutthewire,anotherstraightsit,athirdcutsit,afourth\npoints it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving, the head; to make the\nhead requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbusiness, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put\nthemintothepaper;andtheimportantbusinessofmakingapinis,inthis\nmanner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some\nmanufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the\nsame man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a\nsmall manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and\nwhere some of them consequently performed two or three distinct oper-\nations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently\naccommodatedwiththenecessarymachinery,theycould,whentheyexer-\nted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day.\nThere are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size.\nThose ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-\neightthousandpinsinaday. Eachperson,therefore,makingatenthpart\nofforty-eightthousandpins,mightbeconsideredasmakingfourthousand\neight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and\nindependently, and without any of them having been educated to this pe-\nculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,\nperhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and\nfortieth,perhapsnotthefourthousandeighthundredthpartofwhatthey\nare at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division\nandcombinationoftheirdifferentoperations.\n15 [4] Ineveryotherartandmanufacture,theeffectsofthedivisionoflabour\nare similar to what they are in this very trifling one; though, in many of\nthem, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\ngreatasimplicityofoperation. Thedivisionoflabour,however,sofarasit\ncanbeintroduced,occasions,ineveryart,aproportionableincreaseofthe\nproductive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and em-\nploymentsfromoneanother,seemstohavetakenplace,inconsequenceof\nthis advantage. This separation too is generally carried furthest in those\ncountries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement;\nwhat is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally\nthatofseveralinanimprovedone. Ineveryimprovedsociety,thefarmeris G.ed.p16\ngenerallynothingbutafarmer;themanufacturer,nothingbutamanufac-\nturer. Thelabourtoowhichisnecessarytoproduceanyonecompleteman-\nufacture, is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How\nmany different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and wool-\nlenmanufactures,fromthegrowersoftheflaxandthewool,tothebleach-\ners and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth!\nThenatureofagriculture,indeed, doesnotadmitofsomanysubdivisions\nof labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business from another,\nas manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely, the business of\nthe grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is\ncommonlyseparatedfromthatofthesmith. Thespinnerisalmostalways\na distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the\nsower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The\n9", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\noccasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different\nseasonsoftheyear,itisimpossiblethatonemanshouldbeconstantlyem-\nployed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and\nentire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in ag-\nriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive\npowersoflabourinthisart,doesnotalwayskeeppacewiththeirimprove-\nment in manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel\nall their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they\narecommonlymoredistinguishedbytheirsuperiorityinthelatterthanin\nthe former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more\nlabour and expense bestowed upon them, produce more, in proportion to\nthe extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of pro-\nduce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour\nand expense. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always\nmuchmoreproductivethanthatofthepoor;or,atleast,itisneversomuch\nmore productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich\ncountry, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come\ncheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same\ndegreeofgoodness,isascheapasthatofFrance,notwithstandingthesu- G.ed.p17\nperioropulenceandimprovementofthelattercountry. ThecornofFrance\nis,inthecornprovinces,fullyasgood,andinmostyearsnearlyaboutthe\nsame price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improve-\nment, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,\nhowever, are better cultivatedthanthose ofFrance, and thecorn-landsof\nFrance are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But\nthoughthepoorcountry,notwithstandingtheinferiorityofitscultivation,\ncan, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its\ncorn,itcanpretendtonosuchcompetitioninitsmanufactures;atleastif\nthosemanufacturessuitthesoil,climate,andsituationoftherichcountry.\nThesilksofFrancearebetterandcheaperthanthoseofEngland,because\nthesilkmanufacture, atleastunderthepresenthighdutiesupontheim-\nportation of raw silk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that\nofFrance. Butthehard-wareandthecoarsewoollensofEnglandarebey-\nond all comparison superior to those of France, and much cheaper too in\nthe same degree of goodness. In Poland there are said to be scarce any\nmanufacturesofanykind,afewofthosecoarserhouseholdmanufactures\nexcepted,withoutwhichnocountrycanwellsubsist.\n16 [5] Thisgreatincreaseofthequantityofwork,which,inconsequenceofthe\ndivision of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,\nisowingtothreedifferentcircumstances;first,totheincreaseofdexterity\nin every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is\ncommonlylostinpassingfromonespeciesofworktoanother;andlastly,to\nthe invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge\nlabour,andenableonemantodotheworkofmany.\n17 [6] First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily\n10", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nincreases the quantity of the work he can perform, and the division of G.ed.p18\nlabour, by reducing every man\u2019s business to some one simple operation,\nand by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessar-\nily increased very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith,\nwho, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to\nmake nails, if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it,\nwill scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred\nnails in a day, and those too very bad ones. A smith who has been accus-\ntomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been\nthat of a nailer, can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than\neighthundredorathousandnailsinaday. Ihaveseenseveralboysunder\ntwenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of\nmaking nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each\nofthem,upwardsoftwothousandthreehundrednailsinaday. Themak-\ning of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The\nsamepersonblowsthebellows,stirsormendsthefireasthereisoccasion,\nheats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: In forging the head too\nhe is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the\nmaking of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much\nmoresimple, andthedexterityoftheperson, ofwhoselifeithasbeenthe\nsolebusinesstoperformthem,isusuallymuchgreater. Therapiditywith\nwhich some of the operations of those manufacturers are performed, ex-\nceedswhatthehumanhandcould, bythosewhohadneverseenthem, be\nsupposedcapableofacquiring.\n18 [7] Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly\nlost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we\nshould at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very\nquickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different\nplace, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a\nsmall farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the\nfield, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried G.ed.p19\non in the same workhouse, the loss of time is no doubt much less. It is\neveninthiscase,however,veryconsiderable.

Independent, therefore,\nofhisdeficiencyinpointofdexterity,thiscausealonemustalwaysreduce\nconsiderablythequantityofworkwhichheiscapableofperforming.\n19 [8] Thirdly, and lastly, every body must be sensible how much labour is\n11", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfacilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is un-\nnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the G.ed.p20\ninventionofallthosemachinesbywhichlabourissomuchfacilitatedand\nabridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.\nMen are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of at-\ntaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed\ntowards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great vari-\nety of things. But in consequence of the division of labour, the whole of\nevery man\u2019s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one\nvery simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that some\none or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of la-\nbour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their\nown particular work, wherever the nature of it admits of such improve-\nment. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures\ninwhichlabourismostsubdivided,wereoriginallytheinventionsofcom-\nmon workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple\noperation, naturallyturnedtheirthoughtstowardsfindingouteasierand\nreadier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed\nto visit such manufactures, must frequently have been shown very pretty\nmachines, which were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facil-\nitate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the first fire-\nengines, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the\ncommunication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the pis-\nton either ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play\nwith his companions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of\nthe valve, which opened this communication, to another part of the ma-\nchine, the valve would open and shut without his assistance, and leave\nhim at liberty to divert himself with his play-fellows.

In the progress of society, philo-\nsophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the principal\nor sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens. Like every\nother employment too, it is subdivided into a great number of different\nbranches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of G.ed.p22\nphilosophers; and this subdivision of employment in philosophy, as well\nasineveryotherbusiness,improvesdexterity,andsavestime.

Nobody but a beggar chuses to depend chiefly upon the\nbenevolence of his fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon\nit entirely. The charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with\nthe whole fund of his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately\nprovides him with all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it\nneither does nor can provide him with them as he has occasion for them.\nThegreaterpartofhisoccasionalwantsaresuppliedinthesamemanner\nas those of other people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase.

In a tribe of hunters or shepherds a par-\nticular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness\nand dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or\nfor venison with his companions; and he finds at last that he can in this\nmannergetmorecattleandvenisonthanifhehimselfwenttothefieldto\ncatch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of\nbows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of\narmourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little G.ed.p28\nhuts or movable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his\nneighbours,whorewardhiminthesamemannerwithcattleandwithven-\nison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this\nemployment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same man-\nner a third becomes a smith or a brazier, a fourth a tanner or dresser of\nhides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the\ncertainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of\nhis own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such\nparts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he may have occasion for,\nencourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to\n16", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncultivateandbringtoperfectionwhatevertalentorgeniushemaypossess\nforthatparticularspeciesofbusiness.\n26 [4] The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much\nless than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears\ntodistinguishmenofdifferentprofessions, whengrownuptomaturity, is\nnotuponmanyoccasionssomuchthecause,astheeffectofthedivisionof\nlabour.

About that age, or soon after,\nthey come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference\nof talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till\nat last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any\nresemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange,\neverymanmusthaveprocuredtohimselfeverynecessaryandconveniency\nof life which he wanted. All must have had the same duties to perform,\nand the same work to do, and there could have been no such difference of\nemploymentascouldalonegiveoccasiontoanygreatdifferenceoftalents.\n27 [5] As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so re-\nmarkable among men of different professions, so it is this same dispos-\nition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals ac-\nknowledgedtobeallofthesamespecies,derivefromnatureamuchmore\nremarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and\neducation, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is G.ed.p30\nnot in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a\nmastiff is from a greyhound, or a greyhound from a spaniel, or this last\nfromashepherd\u2019sdog. Thosedifferenttribesofanimals, however, though\nallofthesamespecies,areofscarceanyusetooneanother. Thestrength\nof the mastiff is not, in the least, supported either by the swiftness of the\ngreyhound,orbythesagacityofthespaniel,orbythedocilityoftheshep-\nherd\u2019s dog.

The inland parts of the\n19", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncountry can for a long time have no other market for the greater part\nof their goods, but the country which lies round about them, and separ-\nates them from the sea-coast, and the great navigable rivers. The extent\nof their market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the\nriches and populousness of that country, and consequently their improve-\nmentmustalwaysbeposteriortotheimprovementofthatcountry. Inour\nNorth American colonies the plantations have constantly followed either\nthe sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have scarce any-\nwhereextendedthemselvestoanyconsiderabledistancefromboth.\n32 [5] The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear\nto have been first civilised, were those that dwelt round the coast of the\nMediterranean Sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in\ntheworld,havingnotides,norconsequentlyanywavesexceptsuchasare\ncaused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well\nas by the multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring\nshores, extremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when,\nfrom their ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of\nthecoast,andfromtheimperfectionoftheartofshipbuilding,toabandon\nthemselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond the pil-\nlars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the Straits of Gibraltar, was, in the\nancientworld,longconsideredasamostwonderfulanddangerousexploit\nofnavigation.

UpperEgyptextends G.ed.p35\nitself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile, and in Lower Egypt that\ngreat river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the as-\nsistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a communication by water-\ncarriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all the con-\nsiderablevillages,andeventomanyfarmhousesinthecountry; nearlyin\nthe same manner as the Rhine and the Maas do in Holland at present.\nTheextentandeasinessofthisinlandnavigationwasprobablyoneofthe\nprincipalcausesoftheearlyimprovementofEgypt.\n34 [7] The improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to\nhave been of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East\nIndies,andinsomeoftheeasternprovincesofChina;thoughthegreatex-\ntentofthisantiquityisnotauthenticatedbyanyhistoriesofwhoseauthor-\nity we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal the Ganges\nandseveralothergreatriversformagreatnumberofnavigablecanalsin\nthe same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the Eastern provinces of\nChina too, several great rivers form, by their different branches, a multi-\ntude of canals, and by communicating with one another afford an inland\nnavigationmuchmoreextensivethanthateitheroftheNileortheGanges,\n20", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nor perhaps than both of them put together. It is remarkable that neither\nthe ancient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the Chinese, encouraged for-\neigncommerce,butseemalltohavederivedtheirgreatopulencefromthis\ninlandnavigation.\n35 [8] All the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies\nany considerable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient G.ed.p36\nScythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem in all ages of the world to\nhave been in the same barbarous and uncivilised state in which we find\nthem at present. The Sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean which admits of\nno navigation, and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run\nthroughthatcountry,theyareattoogreatadistancefromoneanotherto\ncarry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There\nare in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic\nseas in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and\nAsia, and the gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to\ncarry maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent:\nandthegreatriversofAfricaareattoogreatadistancefromoneanother\nto give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce be-\nsides which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not\nbreak itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs\ninto another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very consid-\nerable; because it is always in the power of the nations who possess that\nother territory to obstruct the communication between the upper country\nand the sea. The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to the dif-\nferent states of Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, in comparison of what it\nwould be if any of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into\ntheBlackSea.\n21", "CHAPTER IV\nG.ed.p37\nOF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY\n36 [1] WHEN the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is\nbutaverysmallpartofaman\u2019swantswhichtheproduceofhisownlabour\ncan supply.

Everymanthuslivesbyexchanging,orbecomesinsome\nmeasure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a\ncommercialsociety.\n37 [2] But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power\nof exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embar-\nrassed in its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a cer-\ntain commodity than he himself has occasion for, while another has less.\nThe former consequently would be glad to dispose of, and the latter to\npurchase, a part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to\nhave nothing that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made\nbetween them. The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself\ncanconsume,andthebrewerandthebakerwouldeachofthembewilling\nto purchase a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, ex-\ncept the different productions of their respective trades, and the butcher\nis already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate\noccasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He\ncannotbetheirmerchant,northeyhiscustomers;andtheyareallofthem\nthusmutuallylessserviceabletooneanother.

Intherudeagesofsociety,cattle\nare said to have been the common instrument of commerce; and, though\nthey must have been a most inconvenient one, yet in old times we find\nthingswerefrequentlyvaluedaccordingtothenumberofcattlewhichhad", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbeen given in exchange for them.

Metalscannotonlybekeptwithaslittleloss\nas any other commodity, scarce anything being less perishable than they G.ed.p39\nare, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number\nof parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be reunited again; a quality\nwhichnootherequallydurablecommoditiespossess,andwhichmorethan\nanyotherqualityrendersthemfittobetheinstrumentsofcommerceand\ncirculation.

He could seldom buy\nless than this, because what he was to give for it could seldom be divided\nwithout loss; and if he had a mind to buy more, he must, for the same\nreasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity, the value,\nto wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three sheep. If, on the contrary,\ninsteadofsheeporoxen,hehadmetalstogiveinexchangeforit,hecould\neasily proportion the quantity of the metal to the precise quantity of the\ncommoditywhichhehadimmediateoccasionfor.\n40 [5] Different metals have been made use of by different nations for this\npurpose.

These\nbars,therefore,performedatthistimethefunctionofmoney.\n[7] Theuseofmetalsinthisrudestatewasattendedwithtwoveryconsid-\n42\nerable inconveniencies; first, with the trouble of weighing; and, secondly,\nwith that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a small dif-\nference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value, even the G.ed.p40\nbusiness of weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least very accur-\nateweightsandscales. Theweighingofgoldinparticularisanoperation\nof some nicety. In the coarser metals, indeed, where a small error would\n1[Smith]Plin.Hist.Nat.lib.33cap.3.\n23", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbe of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be necessary. Yet\nwe should find it excessively troublesome, if every time a poor man had\noccasion either to buy or sell a farthing\u2019s worth of goods, he was obliged\nto weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still more difficult,\nstill more tedious, and, unless a part of the metal is fairly melted in the\ncrucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion that can be drawn from\nit, is extremely uncertain. Before the institution of coined money, how-\never,unlesstheywentthroughthistediousanddifficultoperation,people\nmust always have been liable to the grossest frauds and impositions, and\ninstead of a pound weight of pure silver, or pure copper, might receive\nin exchange for their goods an adulterated composition of the coarsest\nandcheapestmaterials,whichhad,however,intheiroutwardappearance,\nbeenmadetoresemblethosemetals.

Hence the origin of coined money, and of\nthose public offices called mints; institutions exactly of the same nature\nwith those of the aulnagers and stamp-masters of woolen and linen cloth.\nAll of them are equally meant to ascertain, by means of a public stamp, G.ed.p41\nthe quantity and uniform goodness of those different commodities when\nbroughttomarket.\n43 [8] The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current\nmetals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it\nwas both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or\nfineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is\nat present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which\nis sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which being struck only upon\none side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the\nfineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the\nfour hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of\nMachpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the mer-\nchant,andyetarereceivedbyweightandnotbytale,inthesamemanner\nas ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues of the\nancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in money\nbut in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts. William the\nConqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This money,\nhowever,was,foralongtime,receivedattheexchequer,byweightandnot\nbytale.\n[9] The inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exact-\n44\nnessgaveoccasiontotheinstitutionofcoins,ofwhichthestamp,covering\nentirelybothsidesofthepieceandsometimestheedgestoo,wassupposed\ntoascertainnotonlythefineness,buttheweightofthemetal.

InthetimeofServiusTul-\nlius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a\nRoman pound of good copper. It was divided in the same manner as our\nTroyes pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce\nof good copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I, con-\ntained a pound, Tower weight, of silver, of a known fineness. The Tower\npound seems to have been something more than the Roman pound, and\nsomething less than the Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into\nthe mint of England till the 18th of Henry VIII. The French livre con-\ntained in the time of Charlemagne a pound, Troyes weight, of silver of a\nknown fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time fre-\nquented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of so\nfamous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money\npound contained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert\nBruce, a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the Eng-\nlishpoundsterling. English,French,andScotspennies,too,containedall\nof them originally a real pennyweight of silver, the twentieth part of an\nounce,andthetwo-hundred-and-fortiethpartofapound.

From the time of\nCharlemagne among the French, and from that of William the Conqueror\namong the English, the proportion between the pound, the shilling, and\nthe penny, seems to have been uniformly the same as at present, though\nthevalueofeachhasbeenverydifferent. Forineverycountryoftheworld,\nI believe, the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states, abus-\ning the confidence of their subjects, have by degrees diminished the real\nquantityofmetal,whichhadbeenoriginallycontainedintheircoins.

They contain the value of a certain quantity of\nlabour which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain G.ed.p48\nthe value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first price, the original\npurchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by\nsilver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally pur-\nchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange\nit for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labour\nwhichitcanenablethemtopurchaseorcommand.\n56 [3] Wealth, as Mr. Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either ac-\nquires, orsucceeds to a great fortune, does notnecessarily acquireor suc-\nceed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, per-\nhaps, afford him the means of acquiring both, but the mere possession of\nthat fortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthat possession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of\npurchasing;acertaincommandoverallthelabour,oroveralltheproduce\nof labour, which is then in the market.

It is more\nnatural, therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of\nsome other commodity than by that of the labour which it can purchase.\nThe greater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a\nquantityofaparticularcommoditythanbyaquantityoflabour. Theoneis\naplainpalpableobject; theotheranabstractnotion, which, thoughitcan\nbemadesufficientlyintelligible,isnotaltogethersonaturalandobvious.\n59 [6] But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instru-\nment of commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently ex-\nchangedformoneythanforanyothercommodity.

Henceitcomestopassthattheexchangeablevalueofevery\ncommodityismorefrequentlyestimatedbythequantityofmoney,thanby\nthe quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had\ninexchangeforit.\n60 [7] Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their\nvalue, are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier\nand sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which\nanyparticularquantityofthemcanpurchaseorcommand,orthequantity\nof other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertil-\nity or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time\nwhen such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of\nAmerica reduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in\nEurope to about a third of what it had been before. As it costs less labour\nto bring those metals from the mine to the market, so when they were G.ed.p50\nbrought thither they could purchase or command less labour; and this re-\nvolution in their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the\nonlyoneofwhichhistorygivessomeaccount. Butasameasureofquantity,\nsuch as the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying\nin its own quantity, can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of\notherthings;soacommoditywhichisitselfcontinuallyvaryinginitsown\nvalue, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodit-\nies. Equalquantitiesoflabour,atalltimesandplaces,maybesaidtobeof\nequal value to the labourer.

The same real price is always of the same\nvalue; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver, the\nsame nominal price is sometimes of very different values. When a landed\nestate,therefore,issoldwithareservationofaperpetualrent,ifitisinten-\nded that this rent should always be of the same value, it is of importance\nto the family in whose favour it is reserved that it should not consist in a\nparticularsumofmoney.

Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the\nvalueofamoneyrent.\n65 [12] The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold\nand silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though\nI apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is\nlikelytocontinuetodosoforalongtime. Uponthissupposition,therefore,\nsuch variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the value of\na money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not in such\na quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many pounds\nsterling, for example), but in so many ounces either of pure silver, or of\nsilverofacertainstandard.\n66 [13] Therentswhichhavebeenreservedincornhavepreservedtheirvalue\nmuch better than those which have been reserved in money, even where\nthe denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Eliza-\nbeth it was enacted that a third of the rent of all college leases should be\nreserved in corn, to be paid, either in kind, or according to the current\nprices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn\nrent,thoughoriginallybutathirdofthewhole,isinthepresenttimes,ac-\ncording to Dr. Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises from the\nother two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according to this\naccount, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value; or are\nworth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly\nworth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary the denomination of the\nEnglish coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same number\n31", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nofpounds,shillingsandpencehavecontainedverynearlythesamequant-\nity of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of the money\nrents of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in the value\nofsilver.\n67 [14] When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the di-\nminutionofthequantityofitcontainedinthecoinofthesamedenomina-\ntion,thelossisfrequentlystillgreater. InScotland,wherethedenomina- G.ed.p53\ntionofthecoinhasundergonemuchgreateralterationsthaniteverdidin\nEngland, and in France, where it has undergone still greater than it ever\ndidinScotland, someancientrents, originallyofconsiderablevalue, have\ninthismannerbeenreducedalmosttonothing.\n68 [15] Equal quantities of labour will at distant times be purchased more\nnearlywithequalquantitiesofcorn, thesubsistenceofthelabourer, than\nwithequalquantitiesofgoldandsilver,orperhapsofanyothercommodity.\nEqualquantitiesofcorn,therefore,will,atdistanttimes,bemorenearlyof\nthesamerealvalue,orenablethepossessortopurchaseorcommandmore\nnearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They will do this,\nI say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other commodity;\nfor even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The subsistence of\nthelabourer,ortherealpriceoflabour,asIshallendeavourtoshowhere-\nafter, is very different upon different occasions; more liberal in a society\nadvancing to opulence than in one that is standing still; and in one that\nis standing still than in one that is going backwards.

Themoneypriceoflabour,asIshallendeav-\nourtoshowhereafter,doesnotfluctuatefromyeartoyearwiththemoney\nprice of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the tem-\nporaryoroccasional,buttotheaverageorordinarypriceofthatnecessary\nof life. The average or ordinary price of corn again is regulated, as I shall\nlikewiseendeavourtoshowhereafter,bythevalueofsilver,bytherichness\norbarrennessofthemineswhichsupplythemarketwiththatmetal,orby\nthe quantity of labour which must be employed, and consequently of corn\nwhichmustbeconsumed,inordertobringanyparticularquantityofsilver G.ed.p54\nfromtheminetothemarket. Butthevalueofsilver,thoughitsometimes\nvaries greatly from century to century, seldom varies much from year to\nyear, but frequently continues the same, or very nearly the same, for half\n32", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\na century or a century together. The ordinary or average money price of\ncorn, therefore, may, during so long a period, continue the same or very\nnearlythesametoo,andalongwithitthemoneypriceoflabour,provided,\nat least, the society continues, in other respects, in the same or nearly in\nthe same condition.

Butwhencornisatthelatterprice,notonlythenominal,butthe\nrealvalueofacornrentwillbedoubleofwhatitiswhenattheformer,or\nwill command double the quantity either of labour or of the greater part\nof other commodities; the money price of labour, and along with it that of\nmostotherthings,continuingthesameduringallthesefluctuations.\n70 [17] Labour,therefore,itappearsevidently,istheonlyuniversal,aswellas\ntheonlyaccuratemeasureofvalue,ortheonlystandardbywhichwecan\ncomparethevaluesofdifferentcommoditiesatalltimes,andatallplaces.\nWe cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different commodities\nfrom century to century by the quantities of silver which were given for\nthem. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities of corn.\nBy the quantities of labour we can, with the greatest accuracy, estimate\nit both from century to century and from year to year. From century to\ncentury, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from century to\ncentury,equalquantitiesofcornwillcommandthesamequantityoflabour\nmore nearly than equal quantities of silver.

Itisso,however,atthe\nsametimeandplaceonly.\n73 [20] Though at distant places, there is no regular proportion between the\nreal and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries\ngoods from the one to the other has nothing to consider but their money\nprice, or the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys\nthem, and that for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver\nat Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and\nof the necessaries and conveniences of life than an ounce at London. A\ncommodity,therefore,whichsellsforhalfanounceofsilveratCantonmay\ntherebereallydearer,ofmorerealimportancetothemanwhopossessesit\n33", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthere,thanacommoditywhichsellsforanounceatLondonistotheman\nwho possesses it at London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at\nCanton for half an ounce of silver, a commodity which he can afterwards\nsell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent by the bargain,\njust as much as if an ounce of silver was at London exactly of the same\nvalue as at Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an ounce of\nsilver at Canton would have given him the command of more labour and\nof a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life than an\nounce can do at London. An ounce at London will always give him the\ncommand of double the quantity of all these which half an ounce could\nhavedonethere,andthisispreciselywhathewants.\n74 [21] As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally\ndetermines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and\ntherebyregulatesalmostthewholebusinessofcommonlifeinwhichprice\nis concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more\nattendedtothantherealprice.\n75 [22] Insuchaworkasthis,however,itmaysometimesbeofusetocompare\nthe different real values of a particular commodity at different times and\nplaces, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people\nwhichitmay, upondifferentoccasions, havegiventothosewhopossessed\nit. We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of\nsilverforwhichitwascommonlysold,asthedifferentquantitiesoflabour\nwhich those different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the G.ed.p56\ncurrent prices of labour at distant times and places can scarce ever be\nknown with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they have\nin few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known and\nhavebeenmorefrequentlytakennoticeofbyhistoriansandotherwriters.\nWe must generally, therefore, content ourselves with them, not as being\nalways exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of labour, but\nas being the nearest approximation which can commonly be had to that\nproportion. Ishallhereafterhaveoccasiontomakeseveralcomparisonsof\nthiskind.\n76 [23] In the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it conveni-\nent to coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments,\nsilver for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse\nmetal,forthoseofstillsmallerconsideration. Theyhavealways,however,\nconsidered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of value\nthan any of the other two; and this preference seems generally to have\nbeen given to the metal which they happened first to make use of as the\ninstrument of commerce.

In England, gold was not considered as a\nlegaltenderforalongtimeafteritwascoinedintomoney. Theproportion\nbetween the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by any public\nlaw or proclamation; but was left to be settled by the market. If a debtor\noffered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject such payment\naltogether, or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he and his\ndebtorcouldagreeupon.

In this state of things, and during the continu-\nance of any one regulated proportion of this kind, the distinction between\nthe metal which is the standard, and that which is not the standard, be-\ncomeslittlemorethananominaldistinction.\n81 [28] In consequence of any change, however, in this regulated proportion,\n1[Smith]Pliny,lib.xxxiii.c.3.\n35", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthisdistinctionbecomes,oratleastseemstobecome,somethingmorethan\nnominalagain.

Thevalueofgoldwouldseemtodependupon\nthe quantity of silver which it would exchange for; and the value of sil-\nver would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which it would\nexchange for. This difference, however, would be altogether owing to the\ncustomofkeepingaccounts,andofexpressingtheamountofallgreatand\nsmall sums rather in silver than in gold money.

Before the re-\nformationofthegoldcoin,themarketpricewasalwaysmoreorlessabove\nthe mint price. Since that reformation, the market price has been con-\nstantly below the mint price. But that market price is the same whether\nit is paid in gold or in silver coin. The late reformation of the gold coin,\ntherefore, has raised not only the value of the gold coin, but likewise that\nof the silver coin in proportion to gold bullion, and probably, too, in pro-\nportion to all other commodities; through the price of the greater part of\nother commodities being influenced by so many other causes, the rise in\nthe value either of gold or silver coin in proportion to them may not be so\ndistinctandsensible.\n86 [33] IntheEnglishmintapoundweightofstandardsilverbullioniscoined G.ed.p60\ninto sixty-two shillings, containing, in the same manner, a pound weight\nofstandardsilver.

But in the English\ncoin silver was then, in the same manner as now, under-rated in propor-\ntiontogold,andthegoldcoin(whichatthattimetoowasnotsupposedto\nrequire any reformation) regulated then, as well as now, the real value of\nthe whole coin. As the reformation of the silver coin did not then reduce\nthe price of silver bullion to the mint price, it is not very probable that a\nlikereformationwilldosonow.\n89 [36] Werethesilvercoinbroughtbackasneartoitsstandardweightasthe\ngold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the present proportion,\nexchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in bullion.

But gold in coin is more G.ed.p62\nconvenient than gold in bullion, and though, in England, the coinage is\nfree, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint can seldom be\nreturned in coin to the owner till after a delay of several weeks. In the\npresenthurryofthemint,itcouldnotbereturnedtillafteradelayofsev-\neral months. This delay is equivalent to a small duty, and renders gold\nin coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bul-\nlion. If in the English coin silver was rated according to it proper propor-\ntion to gold, the price of silver bullion would probably fall below the mint\npriceevenwithoutanyreformationofthesilvercoin;thevalueevenofthe\npresent worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the value of the\nexcellentgoldcoinforwhichitcanbechanged.\n92 [39] A small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver\nwould probably increase still more the superiority of those metals in coin\nabove an equal quantity of either of them in bullion.

The merchant importers,\nlike all other merchants, we may believe, endeavour, as well as they can,\n39", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto suit their occasional importations to what, they judge, is likely to be\ntheimmediatedemand. Withalltheirattention,however,theysometimes\noverdo the business, and sometimes underdo it. When they import more\nbullionthaniswanted,ratherthanincurtheriskandtroubleofexporting\nit again, they are sometimes willing to sell a part of it for something less\nthantheordinaryoraverageprice.

But when,\nunder all those occasional fluctuations, the market price either of gold or\nsilverbullioncontinuesforseveralyearstogethersteadilyandconstantly,\neither more or less above, or more or less below the mint price, we may\nbe assured that this steady and constant, either superiority or inferior-\nity of price, is the effect of something in the state of the coin, which, at\nthattime,rendersacertainquantityofcoineitherofmorevalueorofless\nvalue than the precise quantity of bullion which it ought to contain.

If among a nation of hunters, for example, it usually costs\ntwice the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver\nshouldnaturallyexchangefororbeworthtwodeer.

Such talents can seldom be acquired but in con-\nsequence of long application, and the superior value of their produce may\nfrequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and\nlabour which must be spent in acquiring them.

The value which the workmen add to the materials,\ntherefore, resolvesitself inthis ease into two parts, ofwhichtheonepays\ntheir wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock\nof materials and wages which he advanced. He could have no interest to\nemploy them, unless he expected from the sale of their work something\nmore than what was sufficient to replace his stock to him; and he could\nhave no interest to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless\nhisprofitsweretobearsomeproportiontotheextentofhisstock.\n101 [6] The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought are only a different\nname for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspec-\ntion and direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated\nby quite different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the\nhardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and dir-\nection. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock employed,\nand are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock. Let\nussuppose,forexample,thatinsomeparticularplace,wherethecommon\nannual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent, there are two dif-\nferent manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are employed at\nthe rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the expense of three hundred\na year in each manufactory.

Inthepriceofcommodities,therefore,theprofitsof\nstock constitute a component part altogether different from the wages of\nlabour,andregulatedbyquitedifferentprinciples.\n102 [7] In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always\nbelong to the labourer.

Neitheristhequantityoflabourcommonly\n42", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nemployedinacquiringorproducinganycommodity,theonlycircumstance\nwhich can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,\ncommand, or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be\ndue for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished\nthematerialsofthatlabour.\n103 [8] As soon as the land of any country has all become private property,\nthe landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed,\nand demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest,\nthe grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when\nlandwasincommon,costthelaboureronlythetroubleofgatheringthem,\ncome, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must\nthen pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord\na portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or,\nwhatcomestothesamething,thepriceofthisportion,constitutestherent\nof land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities makes a third\ncomponentpart.\n104 [9] The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be\nobserved, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of\nthem, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that\npart of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves G.ed.p68\nitselfintorent,andofthatwhichresolvesitselfintoprofit.\n105 [10] Ineverysocietythepriceofeverycommodityfinallyresolvesitselfinto\nsomeoneorother,orallofthosethreeparts;andineveryimprovedsociety,\nall the three enter more or less, as component parts, into the price of the\nfargreaterpartofcommodities.\n106 [11] Inthepriceofcorn,forexample,onepartpaystherentofthelandlord,\nanother pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring\ncattleemployedinproducingit,andthethirdpaystheprofitofthefarmer.\nThese three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the\nwholepriceofcorn.

In the pro-\ngressofthemanufacture,notonlythenumberofprofitsincrease,butevery\nsubsequent profit is greater than the foregoing; because the capital from\nwhichitisderivedmustalwaysbegreater. Thecapitalwhichemploysthe\nweavers, for example, must be greater than that which employs the spin-\nners; because it not only replaces that capital with its profits, but pays,\nbesides, the wages of the weavers; and the profits must always bear some\nproportiontothecapital.\n110 [15] In the most improved societies, however, there are always a few com- G.ed.p69\nmodities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only, the wages\nof labour, and the profits of stock; and a still smaller number, in which it\nconsists altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of sea-fish, for ex-\nample,onepartpaysthelabourofthefishermen,andtheothertheprofits\nof the capital employed in the fishery. Rent very seldom makes any part\nof it, though it does sometimes, as I shall show hereafter. It is otherwise,\nat least through the greater part of Europe, in river fisheries.

The quantity brought thither will\nsoon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts\nof its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the whole price to its\nnaturalprice.\n134 [15] The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which\nthe prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different ac-\ncidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and\nsometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may\nbe the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose\nandcontinuance,theyareconstantlytendingtowardsit.\n135 [16] Thewholequantityofindustryannuallyemployedinordertobringany\ncommoditytomarketnaturallysuitsitselfinthismannertotheeffectual\ndemand.

The same\nnumber of labourers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very\n49", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndifferent quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of\nspinnersandweaverswilleveryyearproducethesameorverynearlythe\nsame quantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce\noftheonespeciesofindustrywhichcanbesuitedinanyrespecttotheef-\nfectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater and\nfrequently much less than its average produce, the quantity of the com-\nmoditiesbroughttomarketwillsometimesexceedagooddeal, andsome-\ntimes fall short a good deal, of the effectual demand. Even though that\ndemand therefore should continue always the same, their market price G.ed.p76\nwill be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below,\nand sometimes rise a good deal above their natural price. In the other\nspeciesofindustry,theproduceofequalquantitiesoflabourbeingalways\nthe same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the\neffectual demand. While that demand continues the same, therefore, the\nmarket price of the commodities is likely to do so too, and to be either al-\ntogether,orasnearlyascanbejudgedof,thesamewiththenaturalprice.\nThat the price of linen and woolen cloth is liable neither to such frequent\nnor to such great variations as the price of corn, every man\u2019s experience\nwill inform him. The price of the one species of commodities varies only\nwith the variations in the demand: that of the other varies, not only with\nthe variations in the demand, but with the much greater and more fre-\nquent variations in the quantity of what is brought to market in order to\nsupplythatdemand.\n137 [18] The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any\ncommodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve them-\nselves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into rent is\nless affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the least affected\nby them either in its rate or in its value. A rent which consists either\nin a certain proportion or in a certain quantity of the rude produce, is no\ndoubtaffectedinitsyearlyvaluebyalltheoccasionalandtemporaryfluc-\ntuationsinthemarketpriceofthatrudeproduce;butitisseldomaffected\nby them in its yearly rate. In settling the terms of the lease, the landlord\nand farmer endeavour, according to their best judgment, to adjust that\nrate,nottothetemporaryandoccasional,buttotheaverageandordinary\npriceoftheproduce.\n138 [19] Such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate either of wages\nor of profit, according as the market happens to be either overstocked or\nunderstocked with commodities or with labour; with work done, or with\nwork to be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth (with\nwhich the market is almost always understocked upon such occasions),\nand augments the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable\nquantityofit. Ithasnoeffectuponthewagesoftheweavers. Themarketis\nunderstockedwithcommodities,notwithlabour;withworkdone,notwith\nwork to be done. It raises the wages of journeymen tailors. The market\nis here understocked with labour. There is an effectual demand for more\n50", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlabour, for more work to be done than can be had. It sinks the price of\ncolouredsilksandcloths,andtherebyreducestheprofitsofthemerchants\nwho have any considerable quantity of them upon hand. It sinks, too, the G.ed.p77\nwagesoftheworkmenemployedinpreparingsuchcommodities,forwhich\nall demand is stopped for six months, perhaps for a twelvemonth. The\nmarketishereover-stockedbothwithcommoditiesandwithlabour.\n139 [20] But though the market price of every particular commodity is in this\nmanner continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural\nprice, yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and\nsometimes particular regulations of police, may, in many commodities,\nkeep up the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the\nnaturalprice.\n140 [21] Whenbyanincreaseintheeffectualdemand,themarketpriceofsome\nparticularcommodityhappenstoriseagooddealabovethenaturalprice,\nthosewhoemploytheirstocksinsupplyingthatmarketaregenerallycare-\nful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great profit\nwould tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same way\nthat, the effectual demand being fully supplied, the market price would\nsoon be reduced to the natural price, and perhaps for some time even be-\nlow it. If the market is at a great distance from the residence of those\nwho supply it, they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for several\nyears together, and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits without\nany new rivals. Secrets of this kind, however, it must be acknowledged,\ncan seldom be long kept; and the extraordinary profit can last very little\nlongerthantheyarekept.\n[22] Secrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets\n141\nin trade. A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular col-\nourwithmaterialswhichcostonlyhalfthepriceofthosecommonlymade\nuse of, may, with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery\nas long as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity.

The whole quantity\nbrought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing\ntogivemorethanwhatissufficienttopaytherentofthelandwhichpro-\nduced them, together with the wages of the labour, and the profits of the\nstockwhichwereemployedinpreparingandbringingthemtomarket,ac-\n51", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncording to their natural rates.

As in the\none case they exclude many people from his employment, so in the other\ntheyexcludehimfrommanyemployments.

Let us suppose, for ex-\nample, that in the greater part of employments the productive powers of\nlabourhadbeenimprovedtotenfold,orthataday\u2019slabourcouldproduce\nten times the quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in\na particular employment they had been improved, only to double, or that\na day\u2019s labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had\ndone before. In exchanging the produce of a day\u2019s labour in the greater\npart of employments for that of a day\u2019s labour in this particular one, ten\ntimestheoriginalquantityofworkinthemwouldpurchaseonlytwicethe\noriginal quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound\nweight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In\nreality,however,itwouldbetwiceascheap. Thoughitrequiredfivetimes\nthe quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would require only half the\nquantity of labour either to purchase or to produce it. The acquisition,\ntherefore,wouldbetwiceaseasyasbefore.\n161 [5] But this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the\nwhole produce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first introduc-\ntion of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at\nan end, therefore, long before the most considerable improvements were\nmade in the productive powers of labour, and it would be to no purpose", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompense or G.ed.p83\nwagesoflabour.\n162 [6] As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a\nshare of almost all the produce which the labourer can either raise, or\ncollectfromit. Hisrentmakesthefirstdeductionfromtheproduceofthe\nlabourwhichisemployeduponland.\n163 [7] It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has where-\nwithal to maintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance\nis generally advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who\nemploys him, and who would have no interest to employ him, unless he\nwas to share in the produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be\nreplaced to him with a profit.

The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to\ngive as little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to\nraise,thelatterinordertolowerthewagesoflabour.\n168 [12] It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must,\nupon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force\ntheotherintoacompliancewiththeirterms.

We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower\nthe price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such\ndisputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a\nmaster manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single\n56", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nworkman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they\nhavealreadyacquired.

The poorest labourers, therefore, according to this account,\nmust, one with another, attempt to rear at least four children, in order\nthattwomayhaveanequalchanceoflivingtothatage. Butthenecessary\nmaintenance of four children, it is supposed, may be nearly equal to that\nof one man.

Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase\nthenumberofhisjourneymen.\n177 [21] The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily in-\ncreases with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and\ncannot possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is G.ed.p87\nthe increase of national wealth. The demand for those who live by wages,\ntherefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and\ncannotpossiblyincreasewithoutit.\n178 [22] It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual in-\ncrease,whichoccasionsariseinthewagesoflabour. Itisnot,accordingly,\nin the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are\ngrowing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest. England\nis certainly, in the present times, a much richer country than any part of\nNorth America. The wages of labour, however, are much higher in North\nAmerica than in any part of England. In the province of New York, com-\nmon labourers earn three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to two\nshillings sterling, a day; ship carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence cur-\nrency, with a pint of rum worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six shil-\nlings and sixpence sterling; house carpenters and bricklayers, eight shil-\nlings currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling; journeymen\ntailors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings and tenpence\nsterling. These prices are all above the London price; and wages are said\ntobeashighintheothercoloniesasinNewYork. Thepriceofprovisions\nis everywhere in North America much lower than in England.

Themostdecisivemarkoftheprosperityofanycoun-\ntryis theincreaseof thenumber of itsinhabitants. In GreatBritain, and G.ed.p88\nmost other European countries, they are not supposed to double in less\nthan five hundred years. In the British colonies in North America, it has\nbeen found that they double in twenty or five-and-twenty years. Nor in\nthe present times is this increase principally owing to the continual im-\nportationofnewinhabitants,buttothegreatmultiplicationofthespecies.\nThose who live to old age, it is said, frequently see there from fifty to a\nhundred, and sometimes many more, descendants from their own body.\n59", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nLabour is there so well rewarded that a numerous family of children, in-\nstead of being a burthen, is a source of opulence and prosperity to the\nparents. The labour of each child, before it can leave their house, is com-\nputed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them. A young widow\nwithfourorfiveyoungchildren,who,amongthemiddlingorinferiorranks\nof people in Europe, would have so little chance for a second husband, is\nthere frequently courted as a sort of fortune. The value of children is the\ngreatestofallencouragementstomarriage. Wecannot,therefore,wonder\nthatthepeopleinNorthAmericashouldgenerallymarryveryyoung.

There could\nseldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be obliged to bid\nagainst one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary,\nwould, in this case, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There\nwould be a constant scarcity of employment, and the labourers would be\nobliged to bid against one another in order to get it. If in such a coun-\ntry the wages of labour had ever been more than sufficient to maintain\nthe labourer, and to enable him to bring up a family, the competition of\nthe labourers and the interest of the masters would soon reduce them to\nthis lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity. China has\nbeenlongoneoftherichest,thatis,oneofthemostfertile,bestcultivated,\nmost industrious, and most populous countries in world. It seems, how-\never, to have been long stationary. Marco Polo, who visited it more than\nfive hundred years ago, describes its cultivation, industry, and populous-\nness, almost in the same terms in which they are described by travellers\nin the present times.

In\nthe neighbourhood of Canton many hundred, it is commonly said, many\nthousand families have no habitation on the land, but live constantly in\nlittlefishingboatsupontheriversandcanals.

The same\nor very nearly the same annual labour must therefore continue to be per-\nformed,andthefundsdestinedformaintainingitmustnot,consequently,\nbe sensibly diminished.

Thescantymain-\ntenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom\nthatthingsareatastand,andtheirstarvingconditionthattheyaregoing\nfastbackwards.\n184 [28] In Great Britain the wages of labour seem, in the present times, to be\nevidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to\nbringupafamily.

But on account of the extraordinary ex-\npense of fuel, the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter.\nWages,therefore,beinghighestwhenthisexpenseislowest,itseemsevid-\nent that they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expense; but\nby the quantity and supposed value of the work.

These vary everywhere from year to year, frequently\nfrom month to month. But in many places the money price of labour re-\nmains uniformly the same sometimes for half a century together. If in\nthese places, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in\ndear years, they mustbe at their ease intimes of moderate plenty, andin\naffluenceinthoseofextraordinarycheapness.

It has,\nindeed, in some, owing probably more to the increase of the demand for\nlabourthantothatofthepriceofprovisions.\n187 [31] Thirdly, as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than\nthe wages of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more\nfrom place to place than the price of provisions.

These and most other things which\nare sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things, are\n62", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngenerally fully as cheap or cheaper in great towns than in the remoter\nparts of the country, for reasons which I shall have occasion to explain\nhereafter.

If such direct proof could require\nany collateral evidence to confirm it, I would observe that this has like-\nwisebeenthecaseinFrance,andprobablyinmostotherpartsofEurope.\nWith regard to France there is the clearest proof. But though it is certain\nthat in both parts of the United Kingdom grain was somewhat dearer in\nthe last century than in the present, it is equally certain that labour was\nmuchcheaper.

Inthelastcentury,the\nmostusualday-wagesofcommonlabourthroughthegreaterpartofScot-\nland were sixpence in summer and fivepence in winter. Three shillings a\nweek, the same price very nearly, still continues to be paid in some parts\nof the Highlands and Western Islands. Through the greater part of the\nlow country the most usual wages of common labour are now eightpence\na day; tenpence, sometimes a shilling about Edinburgh, in the counties\nwhich border upon England, probably on account of that neighbourhood,\nand in a few other places where there has lately been a considerable rise\nin the demand for labour, about Glasgow, Carron, Ayrshire, etc. In Eng-\nlandtheimprovementsofagriculture,manufactures,andcommercebegan\nmuch earlier than in Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently\nits price, must necessarily have increased with those improvements. In\nthelastcentury,accordingly,aswellasinthepresent,thewagesoflabour\nwere higher in England than in Scotland.

Hiscalculation,therefore,thoughdifferentinappearance,\ncorresponds very nearly at bottom with that of Judge Hales. Both sup-\nposetheweeklyexpenseofsuchfamiliestobeabouttwentypenceahead.\nBoth the pecuniary income and expense of such families have increased\nconsiderably since that time through the greater part of the kingdom; in\nsome places more, and in some less; though perhaps scarce anywhere so\nmuch as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of labour have\nlately represented them to the public. The price of labour, it must be ob-\nserved, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices\nbeing often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not\nonly according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to\nthe easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated\nby law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual;\nand experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly,\nthoughithasoftenpretendedtodoso.\n191 [35] Therealrecompenseoflabour,therealquantityofthenecessariesand\nconveniences of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during the\ncourse of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater propor-\ntion than its money price.

The common\ncomplaintthatluxuryextendsitselfeventothelowestranksofthepeople,\nandthatthelabouringpoorwillnotnowbecontentedwiththesamefood,\nclothing, and lodging which satisfied them in former times, may convince\nus that it is not the money price of labour only, but its real recompense,\nwhichhasaugmented.\n192 [36] Is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the\npeople to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to the so-\n65", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nciety?

It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved\nHighland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a\npampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally\nexhausted by two or three.

It deserves to be remarked, too,\n66", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthat it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which\nthe demand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increasing,\nthe reward of labour must necessarily encourage in such a manner the\nmarriage and multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to supply\nthat continually increasing demand by a continually increasing popula-\ntion.

The wear and\ntearofthelatter,however,is,inreality,asmuchattheexpenseofhismas-\nter as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of\nevery kind must be such as may enable them, one with another, to con-\ntinue the race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing,\ndiminishing, or stationary demand of the society may happen to require.\nBut though the wear and tear of a free servant be equally at the expense\nof his master, it generally costs him much less than that of a slave.

That destined for performing the same office with regard to the free\nman, is managed by the free man himself. The disorders which generally\nprevail in the economy of the rich, naturally introduce themselves into\nthe management of the former: The strict frugality and parsimonious at-\ntention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the latter.\nUnder such different management, the same purpose must require very\ndifferentdegreesofexpensetoexecuteit. Itappears,accordingly,fromthe G.ed.p99\nexperience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done by free-\nmen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves. It is found\nto do so even at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, where the wages of\ncommonlabouraresoveryhigh.\n198 [42] The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing\nwealth, so it is the cause of increasing population.

Someworkmen,indeed, whentheycanearninfourdayswhat\nwill maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This,\nhowever, is by no means the case with the greater part.

If masters would always listen to the\ndictates of reason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to\nmoderate than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It\nwill be found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so\nmoderately as to be able to work constantly not only preserves his health\nthe longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity\nofwork.\n201 [45] Incheapyears,itispretended,workmenaregenerallymoreidle,andin\ndear ones more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence, there-\nfore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens their in-\ndustry. Thatalittlemoreplentythanordinarymayrendersomeworkmen\nidle, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have this effect upon the\ngreater part, or that men in general should work better when they are ill\nfed than when they are well fed, when they are disheartened than when\ntheyareingoodspirits,whentheyarefrequentlysickthanwhentheyare G.ed.p101\ngenerally in good health, seems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is\nto be observed, are generally among the common people years of sickness\nandmortality,whichcannotfailtodiminishtheproduceoftheirindustry.\n202 [46] In years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust\ntheir subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the\nsamecheapnessofprovisions,byincreasingthefundwhichisdestinedfor\nthe maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially, to\nemployagreaternumber. Farmersuponsuchoccasionsexpectmoreprofit\nfrom their corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants than by\nsellingitatalowpriceinthemarket. Thedemandforservantsincreases,\nwhile the number of those who offer to supply that demand diminishes.\nThepriceoflabour,therefore,frequentlyrisesincheapyears.\n203 [47] In years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make\nall such people eager to return to service. But the high price of provi-\nsions, by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of servants,\ndisposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the number of those\nthey have. In dear years, too, poor independent workmen frequently con-\nsumethelittlestockswithwhichtheyhadusedtosupplythemselveswith\nthematerialsoftheirwork,andareobligedtobecomejourneymenforsub-\nsistence. More people want employment than can easily get it; many are\nwilling to take it upon lower terms than ordinary, and the wages of both\nservantsandjourneymenfrequentlysinkindearyears.\n204 [48] Masters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with\ntheir servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble\nanddependentintheformerthaninthelatter.

A\npoorindependentworkmanwillgenerallybemoreindustriousthanevena\njourneyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of\nhisownindustry; theothersharesitwithhismaster. Theone,inhissep-\narate independent state, is less liable to the temptations of bad company,\nwhich in large manufactories so frequently ruin the morals of the other.\nThesuperiority oftheindependent workman overthose servants whoare\nhiredbythemonthorbytheyear,andwhosewagesandmaintenanceare\nthe same whether they do much or do little, is likely to be still greater.\nCheap years tend to increase the proportion of independent workmen to G.ed.p102\njourneymenandservantsofallkinds,anddearyearstodiminishit.\n205 [49] A French author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr. Messance, re-\nceiver of the taillies in the election of St. Etienne, endeavours to show\nthatthepoordomoreworkincheapthanindearyears,bycomparingthe\nquantity and value of the goods made upon those different occasions in\nthree different manufactures; one of coarse woollens carried on at Elbeuf;\none of linen, and another of silk, both which extend through the whole\ngenerality of Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from\ntheregistersofthepublicoffices,thatthequantityandvalueofthegoods\nmadeinallthosethreemanufactureshasgenerallybeengreaterincheap\nthan in dear years; and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest,\nand least in the dearest years.

Uponexamining,however,theaccountswhichhavebeenpublished\noftheirannualproduce,Ihavenotbeenabletoobservethatitsvariations\nhave had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the\nseasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both manufactures, indeed, ap-\npeartohavedeclinedveryconsiderably. Butin1756,anotheryearofgreat\nscarcity,theScotchmanufacturemademorethanordinaryadvances. The\nYorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not rise to\nwhatithadbeenin1755till1766,aftertherepealoftheAmericanStamp\nAct. In that and the following year it greatly exceeded what it had ever G.ed.p103\nbeenbefore,andithascontinuedtoadvanceeversince.\n207 [51] The produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessar-\nily depend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in\nthe countries where they are carried on as upon the circumstances which\naffect the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace\norwar,upontheprosperityordeclensionofotherrivalmanufactures,and\nupon the good or bad humour of their principal customers. A great part\noftheextraordinarywork,besides,whichisprobablydoneincheapyears,\n70", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnever enters the public registers of manufactures. The men servants who\nleave their masters become independent labourers. The women return to\ntheirparents,andcommonlyspininordertomakecloathsforthemselves\nand their families. Even the independent workmen do not always work\nfor public sale, but are employed by some of their neighbours in manu-\nfactures for family use. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently\nmakes no figure in those public registers of which the records are some-\ntimespublishedwithsomuchparade,andfromwhichourmerchantsand\nmanufacturers would often vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or\ndeclensionofthegreatestempires.\n208 [52] Though the variations in the price of labour not only do not always\ncorrespond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently quite\nopposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of provi-\nsions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour is\nnecessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour, and\nthe price of the necessaries and conveniences of life. The demand for la-\nbour,accordingasithappenstobeincreasing,stationary,ordeclining,orto\nrequire an increasing, stationary, or declining population, determines the\nquantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which must be given\nto the labourer; and the money price of labour is determined by what is\nrequisite for purchasing this quantity. Though the money price of labour,\ntherefore, is sometimes high where the price of provisions is low, it would\nbe still higher, the demand continuing the same, if the price of provisions\nwashigh.\n209 [53] It is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden and\nextraordinaryplenty,anddiminishesinthoseofsuddenandextraordinary\nscarcity, that the money price of labour sometimes rises in the one and\nsinksintheother.\n210 [54] In a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the\nhandsofmanyoftheemployersofindustrysufficienttomaintainandem-\nploy a greater number of industrious people than had been employed the\nyear before; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those G.ed.p104\nmasters, therefore, who want more workmen bid against one another, in\norder to get them, which sometimes raises both the real and the money\npriceoftheirlabour.\n[55] The contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary\n211\nscarcity. The funds destined for employing industry are less than they\nhad been the year before. A considerable number of people are thrown\nout of employment, who bid against one another, in order to get it, which\nsometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a\nyear of extraordinary scarcity, many people were willing to work for bare\nsubsistence. In the succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to get\nlabourersandservants.\n[56] Thescarcityofadearyear,bydiminishingthedemandforlabour,tends\n212\nto lower its price, as the high price of provisions tends to raise it. The\n71", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nplenty of a cheap year, on the contrary, by increasing the demand, tends\nto raise the price of labour, as the cheapness of provisions tends to lower\nit. In the ordinary variations of the price of provisions those two opposite\ncauses seem to counterbalance one another, which is probably in part the\nreasonwhythewagesoflabourareeverywheresomuchmoresteadyand\npermanentthanthepriceofprovisions.\n213 [57] The increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of\nmany commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into\nwages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption both at home and\nabroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the\nincrease of stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a\nsmallerquantityoflabourproduceagreaterquantityofwork. Theowner\nof the stock which employs a great number of labourers, necessarily en-\ndeavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper division and dis-\ntributionofemploymentthattheymaybeenabledtoproducethegreatest\nquantity of work possible.

There are many commodities, therefore, which, in\nconsequence of these improvements, come to be produced by so much less\nlabourthanbeforethattheincreaseofitspriceismorethancompensated\nbythediminutionofitsquantity.\n72", "CHAPTER IX\nG.ed.p105\nOF THE PROFITS OF STOCK\n[1] THEriseandfallintheprofitsofstockdependuponthesamecauseswith\n214\nthe rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining state\nof the wealth of the society; but those causes affect the one and the other\nverydifferently.\n215 [2] The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When\nthe stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their\nmutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is\na like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same\nsociety,thesamecompetitionmustproducethesameeffectinthemall.\n216 [3] It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the\naverage wages of labour even in a particular place, and at a particular\ntime. Wecan,eveninthiscase,seldomdeterminemorethanwhatarethe\nmost usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the\nprofits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating that the person who carries\non a particular trade cannot always tell you himself what is the average\nof his annual profit. It is affected not only by every variation of price in\nthe commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad fortune both\nof his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other accidents to\nwhichgoodswhencarriedeitherbyseaorbyland,orevenwhenstoredin\nawarehouse,areliable.

The country, too, is not only much poorer, but the steps\nby which it advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing,\nseemtobemuchslowerandmoretardy.\n[9] The legal rate of interest in France has not, during the course of the\n222\npresent century, been always regulated by the market rate. In 1720 in-\nterest was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny, or from five\nto two per cent. In 1724 it was raised to the thirtieth penny, or to 31 per\n3\ncent. In 1725 it was again raised to the twentieth penny, or to five per\ncent. In 1766, during the administration of Mr. Laverdy, it was reduced\nto the twenty-fifth penny, or to four per cent. The Abbe Terray raised it\nafterwards to the old rate of five per cent. The supposed purpose of many\nofthoseviolentreductionsofinterestwastopreparethewayforreducing\nthat of the public debts; a purpose which has sometimes been executed.\nFrance is perhaps in the present times not so rich a country as England;\nand though the legal rate of interest has in France frequently been lower\nthan in England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as\ninothercountries,theyhaveseveralverysafeandeasymethodsofevading\nthelaw.

Thestockisattheriskoftheborrower, who, asitwere, insuresit\nto the lender; and four or five per cent may, in the greater part of trades,\nbe both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this insurance, and a sufficient\nrecompense for the trouble of employing the stock. But the proportion\nbetweeninterestandclearprofitmightnotbethesameincountrieswhere\nthe ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal lower, or a good deal\nhigher. If it were a good deal lower, one half of it perhaps could not be\nafforded for interest; and more might be afforded if it were a good deal\nhigher.\n236 [23] In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit\nmay, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of\nlabour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving\nneighbours,amongwhomthewagesoflabourmaybelower.\n237 [24] In reality high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than\nhigh wages. If in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the\ndifferentworkingpeople,theflax-dressers,thespinners,theweavers,etc.,\nshould, all of them, be advanced twopence a day; it would be necessary to\nheightenthepriceofapieceoflinenonlybyanumberoftwopencesequal\ntothenumberofpeoplethathadbeenemployedaboutit,multipliedbythe\nnumberofdaysduringwhichtheyhadbeensoemployed.

Itseemstosupposethatoftheformertobeofamorenice\nanddelicatenaturethanthatofthelatter. Itissoperhapsinsomecases;\nbut in the greater part is it quite otherwise, as I shall endeavour to show\nby and by. The laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to qualify\nany person for exercising the one species of labour, impose the necessity\nof an apprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in different\nplaces. They leave the other free and open to everybody. During the con-\ntinuanceoftheapprenticeship,thewholelabouroftheapprenticebelongs\ntohismaster.

The pecuniary recompense, therefore, of\npaintersandsculptors, oflawyersandphysicians, oughttobemuchmore\nliberal;anditissoaccordingly.\n250 [10] The profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or G.ed.p120\ndifficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed.

In\nthe greater part of manufacturers, a journeyman may be pretty sure of\nemploymentalmosteverydayintheyearthatheisabletowork.

What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, must not\nonly maintain him while he is idle, but make him some compensation for\nthose anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precari-\nous a situation must sometimes occasion. Where the computed earnings\nof the greater part of manufacturers, accordingly, are nearly upon a level\nwiththedaywagesofcommonlabourers,thoseofmasonsandbricklayers\nare generally from one half more to double those wages.

The lowest order\nof artificers, journeymen tailors, accordingly, earn there half a crown a- G.ed.p121\nday, though eighteenpence may be reckoned the wages of common labour.\nIn small towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen tailors fre-\nquentlyscarceequalthoseofcommonlabour;butinLondontheyareoften\nmanyweekswithoutemployment,particularlyduringthesummer.\n255 [15] When the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship,\ndisagreeablenessanddirtinessofthework,itsometimesraisesthewages\nof the most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A\ncollier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly\nabout double, and in many parts of Scotland about three times the wages\nof common labour. His high wages arise altogether from the hardship,\ndisagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon\nmost occasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in Lon-\ndon exercise a trade which in hardship, dirtiness, and disagreeableness,\nalmostequalsthatofcolliers;andfromtheunavoidableirregularityinthe\narrivals of coal-ships, the employment of the greater part of them is ne-\ncessarilyveryinconstant.

Two different causes contrib-\nute torecommend them. First, the desire of the reputation whichattends\n87", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nuponsuperiorexcellenceinanyofthem;and,secondly,thenaturalconfid-\nence which every man has more or less, not only in his own abilities, but\ninhisowngoodfortune.\n264 [24] Toexcelinanyprofession,inwhichbutfewarriveatmediocrity,isthe\nmostdecisivemarkofwhatiscalledgeniusorsuperiortalents.

It makes a considerable part of that reward in the\nprofession of physic; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and\nphilosophyitmakesalmostthewhole.\n265 [25] There are some very agreeable and beautiful talents of which the pos- G.ed.p124\nsession commands a certain sort of admiration; but of which the exercise\nfor the sake of gain is considered, whether from reason or prejudice, as a\nsort of public prostitution. The pecuniary recompense, therefore, of those\nwho exercise them in this manner must be sufficient, not only to pay for\nthetime,labour,andexpenseofacquiringthetalents,butforthediscredit\nwhich attends the employment of them as the means of subsistence. The\nexorbitantrewardsofplayers,opera-singers,opera-dancers,etc.,arefoun-\nded upon those two principles; the rarity and beauty of the talents, and\nthe discredit of employing them in this manner. It seems absurd at first\nsight that we should despise their persons and yet reward their talents\nwith the most profuse liberality. While we do the one, however, we must\nof necessity do the other. Should the public opinion or prejudice ever al-\nter with regard to such occupations, their pecuniary recompense would\nquickly diminish. More people would apply to them, and the competition\nwould quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such talents, though far\nfrombeingcommon,arebynomeanssorareasisimagined. Manypeople\npossess them in great perfection, who disdain to make this use of them;\nand many more are capable of acquiring them, if anything could be made\nhonourablybythem.\n266 [26] The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their\nownabilitiesisanancientevilremarkedbythephilosophersandmoralists\nof all ages. Their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been\nless taken notice of. It is, however, if possible, still more universal.

In the\nstate lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid by\nthe original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for twenty,\nthirty, and sometimes forty per cent advance. The vain hope of gaining\n88", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nsome of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand. The soberest\npeople scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the chance of\ngainingtenortwentythousandpounds; thoughtheyknowthateventhat\nsmall sum is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent more than the chance is\nworth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds, though in\nother respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one than the\ncommon state lotteries, there would not be the same demand for tickets.\nIn order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes, some people\npurchaseseveraltickets,andothers,smallshareinastillgreaternumber.\nThere is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than\nthat the more tickets you adventure upon, the more likely you are to be a\nloser.

In order to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a trade\natall,thecommonpremiummustbesufficienttocompensatethecommon\nlosses, to pay the expense of management, and to afford such a profit as\nmight have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any common\ntrade.

Butthoughmanypeoplehavemadealittlemoney\nby insurance, very few have made a great fortune; and from this consid-\neration alone, it seems evident enough that the ordinary balance of profit\nandlossisnotmoreadvantageousinthisthaninothercommontradesby\nwhichsomanypeoplemakefortunes. Moderate,however,asthepremium\nof insurance commonly is, many people despise the risk too much to care\nto pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen houses in\ntwenty, or rather perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred, are not insured from G.ed.p126\nfire. Sea risk is more alarming to the greater part of people, and the pro-\nportion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater. Many fail,\nhowever, at all seasons, and even in time of war, without any insurance.\nThis may sometimes perhaps be done without any imprudence. When a\ngreat company, or even a great merchant, has twenty or thirty ships at\nsea, they may, as it were, insure one another. The premium saved upon\nthemallmaymorethancompensatesuchlossesastheyarelikelytomeet\nwithinthecommoncourseofchances. Theneglectofinsuranceuponship-\nping, however, in the same manner as upon houses, is, in most cases, the\neffect of no such nice calculation, but of mere thoughtless rashness and\npresumptuouscontemptoftherisk.\n269 [29] The contempt of risk and the presumptuous hope of success are in no\nperiod of life more active than at the age at which young people choose\ntheir professions.

Without regard-\ning the danger, however, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at\nthe beginning of a new war; and though they have scarce any chance of\npreferment,theyfiguretothemselves,intheiryouthfulfancies,athousand\noccasionsofacquiringhonouranddistinctionwhichneveroccur. Thesero-\nmantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is less than\nthat of common labourers, and in actual service their fatigues are much\ngreater.\n271 [31] The lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of\nthe army. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go\nto sea with his father\u2019s consent; but if he enlists as a soldier, it is always\nwithout it. Other people see some chance of his making something by\nthe one trade: nobody but himself sees any of his making anything by\nthe other. The great admiral is less the object of public admiration than\nthe great general, and the highest success in the sea service promises a\nless brilliant fortune and reputation than equal success in the land. The\nsamedifferencerunsthroughalltheinferiordegreesofprefermentinboth.\nBy the rules of precedency a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in\nthe army; but he does not rank with him in the common estimation. As\nthe great prizes in the lottery are less, the smaller ones must be more\nnumerous. Common sailors, therefore, more frequently get some fortune G.ed.p127\nandprefermentthancommonsoldiers;andthehopeofthoseprizesiswhat\nprincipally recommends the trade. Though their skill and dexterity are\nmuchsuperiortothatofalmostanyartificers,andthoughtheirwholelife\nis one continual scene of hardship and danger, yet for all this dexterity\nand skill, for all those hardships and dangers, while they remain in the\nconditionofcommonsailors,theyreceivescarceanyotherrecompensebut\nthe pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their\nwages are not greater than those of common labourers at the port which\nregulates the rate of seamen\u2019s wages. As they are continually going from\nporttoport,themonthlypayofthosewhosailfromallthedifferentportsof\nGreatBritainismorenearlyuponalevelthanthatofanyotherworkmen\nin those different places; and the rate of the port to and from which the\ngreatest number sail, that is the port of London, regulates that of all the\nrest. At London the wages of the greater part of the different classes of\nworkmen are about double those of the same classes at Edinburgh. But\nthe sailors who sail from the port of London seldom earn above three or\nfour shillings a month more than those who sail from the port of Leith,\nand the difference is frequently not so great. In time of peace, and in the\nmerchant service, the London price is from a guinea to about seven-and-\ntwentyshillingsthecalendarmonth.

A tender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is of afraid to\nsend her son to school at a seaport town, lest the sight of the ships and\nthe conversation and adventures of the sailors should entice him to go to\nsea.

Bankruptcies\nare most frequent in the most hazardous trades.

They are so accordingly.\nThe difference between the earnings of a common labourer and those of\na well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently much greater than that\nbetween the ordinary profits in any two different branches of trade. The\napparentdifference, besides, intheprofitsofdifferenttrades, isgenerally\na deception arising from our not always distinguishing what ought to be\nconsideredaswages,fromwhatoughttobeconsideredasprofit.\n275 [35] Apothecaries profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncom-\nmonly extravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no G.ed.p129\nmore than the reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a\nmuch nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever;\nand the trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance. He\nis the physician of the poor in all cases, and of the rich when the distress\nor danger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be suitable to\nhis skill and his trust, and it arises generally from the price at which he\nsells his drugs.

The trade of the grocer may be necessary for the\nconveniency of the inhabitants, and the narrowness of the market may\nnot admit the employment of a larger capital in the business. The man,\nhowever, must not only live by his trade, but live by it suitably to the\nqualificationswhichitrequires.

Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery\ntrade, the wages of the grocer\u2019s labour make but a very trifling addition\n92", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto the real profits of so great a stock. The apparent profits of the wealthy\nretailer, therefore, are there more nearly upon a level with those of the\nwholesale merchant. It is upon this account that goods sold by retail are\ngenerally as cheap and frequently much cheaper in the capital than in\nsmall towns and country villages. Grocery goods, for example, are gener-\nallymuchcheaper;breadandbutcher\u2019smeatfrequentlyascheap.

In such articles as bread and butcher\u2019s\nmeat, the same cause, which diminishes apparent profit, increases prime\ncost. The extent of the market, by giving employment to greater stocks,\ndiminishes apparent profit; but by requiring supplies from a greater dis-\ntance, it increases prime cost. This diminution of the one and increase\nof the other seem, in most cases, nearly to counterbalance one another,\nwhichisprobablythereasonthat,thoughthepricesofcornandcattleare\ncommonly very different in different parts of the kingdom, those of bread\nandbutcher\u2019smeataregenerallyverynearlythesamethroughthegreater\npartofit.\n278 [38] Though the profits of stock both in the wholesale and retail trade are\ngenerally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages,\nyet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the\nformer, andscarceeverinthelatter. Insmalltownsandcountryvillages,\non account of the narrowness of the market, trade cannot always be ex-\ntended as stock extends. In such places, therefore, though the rate of a\nparticular person\u2019s profits may be very high, the sum or amount of them\ncanneverbeverygreat,norconsequentlythatofhisannualaccumulation.\nIn great towns, on the contrary, trade can be extended as stock increases,\nandthecreditofafrugalandthrivingmanincreasesmuchfasterthanhis\nstock.

If the project succeeds, they are\ncommonly at first very high. When the trade or practice becomes thor-\n94", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\noughly established and well known, the competition reduces them to the\nlevelofothertrades.\n284 [44] Secondly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvant-\nagesofthedifferentemploymentsoflabourandstock,cantakeplaceonly\nin the ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of those employ-\nments.\n285 [45] The demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes\ngreaterandsometimeslessthanusual. Intheonecasetheadvantagesof\ntheemploymentriseabove,intheothertheyfallbelowthecommonlevel.\nThe demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest than\nduring the greater part of the year; and wages rise with the demand. In\ntime of war, when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the mer-\nchant service into that of the king, the demand for sailors to merchant\nships necessarily rises with their scarcity, and their wages upon such oc-\ncasions commonly rise from a guinea and seven-and-twenty shillings, to\nforty shillings and three pounds a month. In a decaying manufacture, on\nthecontrary,manyworkmen,ratherthanquittheiroldtrade,areconten-\nted with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable to the nature of\ntheiremployment.\n286 [46] The profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which\nit is employed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary\nor average rate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is em-\nployedinbringingittomarket,riseabovetheirproperlevel,andasitfalls\ntheysinkbelowit. Allcommoditiesaremoreorlessliabletovariationsof\nprice, but some are much more so than others. In all commodities which\nare produced by human industry, the quantity of industry annually em-\nployed is necessarily regulated by the annual demand, in such a manner\nthattheaverageannualproducemay,asnearlyaspossible,beequaltothe\naverage annual consumption. In some employments, it has already been\nobserved, the same quantity of industry will always produce the same, or\nverynearlythesamequantityofcommodities. Inthelinenorwoollenman-\nufactures, for example, the same number of hands will annually work up\nverynearlythesamequantityoflinenandwoollencloth. Thevariationsin\nthemarketpriceofsuchcommodities,therefore,canariseonlyfromsome\naccidentalvariationinthedemand. Apublicmourningraisesthepriceof\nblack cloth. But as the demand for most sorts of plain linen and woollen\ncloth is pretty uniform, so is likewise the price. But there are other em-\nploymentsinwhichthesamequantityofindustrywillnotalwaysproduce\nthe same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of industry, for ex-\nample, will, in different years, produce very different quantities of corn,\nwine, hops, sugar, tobacco, etc. The price of such commodities, therefore, G.ed.p133\nvaries not only with the variations of demand, but with the much greater\nand more frequent variations of quantity, and is consequently extremely\nfluctuating. But the profit of some of the dealers must necessarily fluctu-\nate with the price of the commodities. The operations of the speculative\n95", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmerchant are principally employed about such commodities.

Tohaveservedanapprenticeshipinthetown,underamaster\nproperly qualified, is commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this\nfreedom. The bye laws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number\nofapprenticeswhichanymasterisallowedtohave,andalmostalwaysthe\nnumberofyearswhicheachapprenticeisobligedtoserve. Theintentionof\nboth regulations is to restrain the competition to a much smaller number G.ed.p136\nthan might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade. The limitation\nof the number of apprentices restrains it directly. A long term of appren-\nticeship restrains it more indirectly, but as effectually, by increasing the\nexpenseofeducation.\n298 [6] In Sheffield no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a\ntime, by a bye law of the corporation. In Norfolk and Norwich no master\nweaver can have more than two apprentices, under pain of forfeiting five\npoundsamonthtotheking. Nomasterhattercanhavemorethantwoap-\nprenticesanywhereinEngland,orintheEnglishplantations,underpain\nof forfeiting five pounds a month, half to the king and half to him who\nshallsueinanycourtofrecord. Boththeseregulations,thoughtheyhave\nbeen confirmed by a public law of the kingdom, are evidently dictated by\nthe same corporation spirit which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield. The\nsilk weavers in London had scarce been incorporated a year when they\nenacted a bye-law restraining any master from having more than two ap-\nprentices at a time. It required a particular Act of Parliament to rescind\nthisbye-law.\n299 [7] Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual\ntermestablishedforthedurationofapprenticeshipsinthegreaterpartof\nincorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called uni-\nversities, which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation\nwhatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors, etc., are ex-\npressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient\n98", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntowns. When those particular incorporations which are now peculiarly\ncalled universities were first established, the term of years which it was\nnecessarytostudy,inordertoobtainthedegreeofmasterofarts,appears\nevidently to have been copied from the terms of apprenticeship in com-\nmon trades, of which the incorporations were much more ancient. As to\nhave wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was neces-\nsaryinordertoentitleanypersontobecomeamaster,andtohavehimself\napprenticed in a common trade; so to have studied seven years under a\nmasterproperlyqualifiedwasnecessarytoentitlehimtobecomeamaster,\nteacher, or doctor (words anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and G.ed.p137\ntohavescholarsorapprentices(wordslikewiseoriginallysynonymous)to\nstudyunderhim.\n300 [8] By the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Apprentice-\nship, it was enacted, that no person should for the future exercise any\ntrade, craft, or mystery at that time exercised in England, unless he had\npreviouslyservedtoitanapprenticeshipofsevenyearsatleast;andwhat\nbefore had been the bye law of many particular corporations became in\nEngland the general and public law of all trades carried on in market\ntowns. For though the words of the statute are very general, and seem\nplainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its operation has\nbeenlimitedtomarkettowns,ithavingbeenheldthatincountryvillages\napersonmayexerciseseveraldifferenttrades,thoughhehasnotserveda\nsevenyears\u2019apprenticeshiptoeach, theybeingnecessaryfortheconveni-\nency of the inhabitants, and the number of people frequently not being\nsufficienttosupplyeachwithaparticularsetofhands.\n301 [9] Byastrictinterpretationofthewords,too,theoperationofthisstatute\nhas been limited to those trades which were established in England be-\nfore the 5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to such as have\nbeen introduced since that time. This limitation has given occasion to\nseveral distinctions which, considered as rules of police, appear as fool-\nish as can well be imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a\ncoachmaker can neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make\nhiscoach-wheels,butmustbuythemofamasterwheel-wright;thislatter\ntrade having been exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth. But\na wheelwright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a coach-\nmaker, may either himself make or employ journeyman to make coaches;\nthe trade of a coachmaker not being within the statute, because not ex-\nercised in England at the time when it was made. The manufactures of\nManchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon\nthisaccount,notwithinthestatute,nothavingbeenexercisedinEngland\nbeforethe5thofElizabeth.\n302 [10] In France, the duration of apprenticeships is different in different\ntowns and in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term required G.ed.p138\nin a great number; but before any person can be qualified to exercise the\ntrade as a master, he must, in many of them, serve five years more as\n99", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\na journeyman. During this latter term he is called the companion of his\nmaster,andthetermitselfiscalledhiscompanionship.\n303 [11] In Scotland there is no general law which regulates universally the\nduration of apprenticeships. The term is different in different corpora-\ntions. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed by paying\nasmallfine. Inmosttowns,too,averysmallfineissufficienttopurchase\nthe freedom of any corporation.

But\nthe public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in this way\nmuchcheapertomarket.\n309 [17] It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and\nprofit,byrestrainingthatfreecompetitionwhichwouldmostcertainlyoc-\ncasion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation laws,\nhave been established. In order to erect a corporation, no other author-\nity in ancient times was requisite in many parts of Europe, but that of\n101", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe town corporate in which it was established. In England, indeed, a\ncharter from the king was likewise necessary. But this prerogative of the\ncrown seems to have been reserved rather for extorting money from the\nsubjectthanforthedefenceofthecommonlibertyagainstsuchoppressive\nmonopolies. Upon paying a fine to the king, the charter seems generally\nto have been readily granted; and when any particular class of artificers G.ed.p141\nor traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter, such\nadulterineguilds,astheywerecalled,werenotalwaysdisfranchisedupon\nthat account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to\nexercise their usurped privileges.2 The immediate inspection of all cor-\nporations, and of the bye-laws which they might think proper to enact for\ntheirowngovernment,belongedtothetowncorporateinwhichtheywere\nestablished; and whatever discipline was exercised over them proceeded\ncommonly, not from the king, but from the greater incorporation of which\nthosesubordinateoneswereonlypartsormembers.\n310 [18] The government of towns corporate was altogether in the hands of\ntraders and artificers, and it was the manifest interest of every particu-\nlar class of them to prevent the market from being overstocked, as they\ncommonly express it, with their own particular species of industry, which\nis in reality to keep it always understocked. Each class was eager to es-\ntablishregulationsproperforthispurpose,and,provideditwasallowedto\ndoso,waswillingtoconsentthateveryotherclassshoulddothesame. In\nconsequenceofsuchregulations,indeed,eachclasswasobligedtobuythe\ngoods they had occasion for from every other within the town, somewhat\ndearer than they otherwise might have done. But in recompense, they\nwere enabled to sell their own just as much dearer; so that so far it was\nas broad as long, as they say; and in the dealings of the different classes\nwithinthetownwithoneanother,noneofthemwerelosersbytheseregu-\nlations. Butintheirdealingswiththecountrytheywereallgreatgainers;\nand in these latter dealings consists the whole trade which supports and\nenricheseverytown.\n311 [19] Every town draws its whole subsistence, and all the materials of its\nindustry, from the country. It pays for these chiefly in two ways: first, by\nsendingbacktothecountryapartofthosematerialswroughtupandman-\nufactured;inwhichcasetheirpriceisaugmentedbythewagesofthework-\nmen,andtheprofitsoftheirmastersorimmediateemployers;secondly,by\nsending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured produce, either of\nother countries, or of distant parts of the same country, imported into the\ntown;inwhichcase,too,theoriginalpriceofthosegoodsisaugmentedby\nthe wages of the carriers or sailors, and by the profits of the merchants\nwho employ them.

The whole annual produce of the la-\nbour of the society is annually divided between those two different sets of\npeople. By means of those regulations a greater share of it is given to the\ninhabitants of the town than would otherwise fall to them; and a less to\nthoseofthecountry.\n312 [20] The price which the town really pays for the provisions and materials\nannuallyimportedintoitisthequantityofmanufacturesandothergoods\nannuallyexportedfromit.

In every country\nof Europe we find, at least, a hundred people who have acquired great\nfortunes from small beginnings by trade and manufactures, the industry\nwhich properly belongs to towns, for one who has done so by that which\nproperlybelongstothecountry,theraisingofrudeproducebytheimprove-\nmentandcultivationofland. Industry,therefore,mustbebetterrewarded,\nthe wages of labour and the profits of stock must evidently be greater in\nthe one situation than in the other. But stock and labour naturally seek\nthe most advantageous employment. They naturally, therefore, resort as\nmuchastheycantothetown,anddesertthecountry.\n314 [22] The inhabitants of a town, being collected into one place, can easily\ncombine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns have\naccordingly, in some place or other, been incorporated, and even where\ntheyhaveneverbeenincorporated,yetthecorporationspirit,thejealousy\nofstrangers,theaversiontotakeapprentices,ortocommunicatethesecret\nof their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach them, by volun-\ntary associations and agreements, to prevent that free competition which\nthey cannot prohibit by bye-laws. The trades which employ but a small\nnumber of hands run most easily into such combinations. Half a dozen G.ed.p143\nwool-combers, perhaps, are necessary to keep a thousand spinners and\nweavers at work. By combining not to take apprentices they can not only\nengross the employment, but reduce the whole manufacture into a sort of\nslaverytothemselves,andraisethepriceoftheirlabourmuchabovewhat\nisduetothenatureoftheirwork.\n103", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n315 [23] Theinhabitantsofthecountry,dispersedindistantplaces,cannoteas-\nily combine together.

Till after the middle of the fourteenth century, five merks, con-\ntaining about as much silver as ten pounds of our present money, was in G.ed.p147\nEngland the usual pay of a curate or a stipendiary parish priest, as we\nfind it regulated by the decrees of several different national councils.

The wages of the master mason, supposing him\nto have been without employment one third of the year, would have fully\nequalled them. By the 12th of Queen Anne, c. 12, it is declared, \u2018That\nwhereasforwantofsufficientmaintenanceandencouragementtocurates,\nthecureshaveinseveralplacesbeenmeanlysupplied,thebishopis,there-\nfore,empoweredtoappointbywritingunderhisbandandsealasufficient\ncertain stipend or allowance, not exceeding fifty and not less than twenty\npounds a year.\u2019 Forty pounds a year is reckoned at present very good pay\nfor a curate, and notwithstanding this Act of Parliament there are many\ncuracies under twenty pounds a year.

The respect paid to the profession, too, makes some\ncompensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary recom-\npense.

It might then not be worth any man\u2019s while to educate his son\nto either of those professions at his own expense. They would be entirely\nabandoned to such as had been educated by those public charities, whose\nnumbers and necessities would oblige them in general to content them-\nselves with a very miserable recompense, to the entire degradation of the\nnowrespectableprofessionsoflawandphysic.\n329 [37] That unprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters are\nprettymuchinthesituationwhichlawyersandphysiciansprobablywould\nbe in upon the foregoing supposition. In every part of Europe the greater\npart of them have been educated for the church, but have been hindered\nby different reasons from entering into holy orders. They have generally,\ntherefore, been educated at the public expense, and their numbers are\neverywhere so great as commonly to reduce the price of their labour to\naverypaltryrecompense.\n330 [38] Before the invention of the art of printing, the only employment by\nwhich a man of letters could make anything by his talents was that of a\npublic or private teacher, or by communicating to other people the curi-\nousandusefulknowledgewhichhehadacquiredhimself: andthisisstill\nsurelyamorehonourable,amoreuseful,andingeneralevenamoreprof-\nitable employment than that other of writing for a bookseller, to which\nthe art of printing has given occasion.

Iso-\ncrates,inwhatiscalledhisdiscourseagainstthesophists,reproachesthe\nteachers of his own times with inconsistency. \u2018They make the most mag-\nnificentpromisestotheirscholars,\u2019 sayshe, \u2018andundertaketoteachthem\nto be wise, to be happy, and to be just, and in return for so important a\nservice they stipulate the paltry reward of four or five minae. They who\nteach wisdom,\u2019 continues he, \u2018ought certainly to be wise themselves; but\nif any man were to sell such a bargain for such a price, he would be con-\nvicted of the most evident folly.\u2019 He certainly does not mean here to ex-\naggerate the reward, and we may be assured that it was not less than\nhe represents it. Four minae were equal to thirteen pounds six shillings\nand eightpence: five minae to sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and four-\npence. Something not less than the largest of those two sums, therefore,\nmustatthattimehavebeenusuallypaidtothemosteminentteachersat\nAthens. Isocrateshimselfdemandedtenminae,orthirty-threepoundssix G.ed.p150\nshillings and eightpence, from each scholar. When he taught at Athens,\nhe is said to have had a hundred scholars. I understand this to be the\nnumber whom he taught at one time, or who attended what we could call\nonecourseoflectures,anumberwhichwillnotappearextraordinaryfrom\nso great a city to so famous a teacher, who taught, too, what was at that\ntime the most fashionable of all sciences, rhetoric.

Manyothereminentteach-\ners in those times appear to have acquired great fortunes. Gorgias made\napresenttothetempleofDelphiofhisownstatueinsolidgold. Wemust\nnot, I presume, suppose that it was as large as the life. His way of living,\nas well as that of Hippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of\nthosetimes,isrepresentedbyPlatoassplendideventoostentation. Plato\nhimself is said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence.

It may somewhat degrade the profession of a public\nteacher; but the cheapness of literary education is surely an advantage\nwhich greatly overbalances this trifling inconveniency. The public, too,\nmightderivestillgreaterbenefitfromit,iftheconstitutionofthoseschools\nand colleges, in which education is carried on, was more reasonable than\nitisatpresentthroughthegreaterpartofEurope.\n333 [41] Thirdly, the policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of la-\nbour and stock both from employment to employment, and from place to\nplace, occasions in some cases a very incovenient inequality in the whole\noftheadvantagesanddisadvantagesoftheirdifferentemployments.\n334 [42] The Statute of Apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labour\nfrom one employment to another, even in the same place. The exclusive\nprivilegesofcorporationsobstructitfromoneplacetoanother,eveninthe\nsameemployment.\n335 [43] It frequently happens that while high wages are given to the work-\nmen in one manufacture, those in another are obliged to content them-\nselves with bare subsistence. The one is in an advancing state, and has,\ntherefore, a continual demand for new bands: the other is in a declining\nstate, and the superabundance of hands is continually increasing. Those\ntwomanufacturesmaysometimesbeinthesametown,andsometimesin\nthe same neighbourhood, without being able to lend the least assistance\nto one another. The Statute of Apprenticeship may oppose it in the one\ncase, and both that and an exclusive corporation in the other. In many\ndifferent manufactures, however, the operations are so much alike, that\ntheworkmencouldeasilychangetradeswithoneanother,ifthoseabsurd\nlaws did not hinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain silk,\nfor example, are almost entirely the same. That of weaving plain woollen\nis somewhat different; but the difference is so insignificant that either a\nlinen or a silk weaver might become a tolerable work in a very few days.\nIf any of those three capital manufactures, therefore, were decaying, the\n110", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nworkmenmightfindaresourceinoneoftheothertwowhichwasinamore G.ed.p152\nprosperous condition; and their wages would neither rise too high in the\nthriving, nor sink too low in the decaying manufacture. The linen manu-\nfacture indeed is, in England, by a particular statute, open to everybody;\nbut as it is not much cultivated through the greater part of the country,\nit can afford no general resource to the workmen of other decaying man-\nufactures, who, wherever the Statute of Apprenticeship takes place, have\nnootherchoicebuteithertocomeupontheparish, ortoworkascommon\nlabourers, for which, by their habits, they are much worse qualified than\nforanysortofmanufacturethatbearsanyresemblancetotheirown.

Who were to be considered as the\npoorofeachparishbecame,therefore,aquestionofsomeimportance. This\nquestion, after some variation, was at last determined by the 13th and\n14th of Charles II when it was enacted, that forty days\u2019 undisturbed res-\nidenceshouldgainanypersonasettlementinanyparish;butthatwithin\nthattimeitshouldbelawfulfortwojusticesofthepeace, uponcomplaint\nmade by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor, to remove any new\ninhabitanttotheparishwherehewaslastlegallysettled;unlessheeither\nrentedatenementoftenpoundsayear,orcouldgivesuchsecurityforthe\n111", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndischarge of the parish where he was then living, as those justices should\njudgesufficient.\n340 [48] Somefrauds,itissaid,werecommittedinconsequenceofthisstatute;\nparishofficerssometimesbribingtheirownpoortogoclandestinelytoan-\notherparish,andbykeepingthemselvesconcealedforfortydaystogaina\nsettlementthere,tothedischargeofthattowhichtheyproperlybelonged.\nIt was enacted, therefore, by the 1st of James II that the forty days\u2019 un-\ndisturbed residence of any person necessary to gain a settlement should\nbe accounted only from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the\nplace of his abode and the number of his family, to one of the churchwar-\ndensoroverseersoftheparishwherehecametodwell.\n341 [49] But parish officers, it seems, were not always more honest with re-\ngard to their own, than they had been with regard to other parishes, and\nsometimes connived at such intrusions, receiving the notice, and taking\nno proper steps in consequence of it. As every person in a parish, there-\nfore,wassupposedtohaveaninteresttopreventasmuchaspossibletheir\nbeingburdenedbysuchintruders,itwasfurtherenactedbythe3rdofWil-\nliam III that the forty days\u2019 residence should be accounted only from the\npublicationofsuchnoticeinwritingonSundayinthechurch,immediately\nafterdivineservice.\n342 [50] \u2018After all,\u2019 says Doctor Burn, \u2018this kind of settlement, by continuing\nforty days after publication of notice in writing, is very seldom obtained;\nandthedesignoftheactsisnotsomuchforgainingofsettlements,asfor\nthe avoiding of them, by persons coming into a parish clandestinely: for\nthegivingofnoticeisonlyputtingaforceupontheparishtoremove. But\nif a person\u2019s situation is such, that it is doubtful whether he is actually\nremovable or not, he shall by giving of notice compel the parish either to\nallow him a settlement uncontested, by suffering him to continue forty G.ed.p154\ndays;or,byremovinghim,totrytheright.\u2019\n343 [51] Thisstatute,therefore,rendereditalmostimpracticableforapoorman\ntogainanewsettlementintheoldway,byfortydays\u2019inhabitancy.

An apprentice is scarce ever married; and it is expressly enacted\n112", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthat no married servant shall gain any settlement by being hired for a\nyear.

Whatsecuritytheyshall\nrequire, indeed, is left altogether to their discretion; but they cannot well\nrequire less than thirty pounds, it having been enacted that the purchase\neven of a freehold estate of less than thirty pounds\u2019 value shall not gain G.ed.p155\nany person a settlement, as not being sufficient for the discharge of the\nparish. But this is a security which scarce any man who lives by labour\ncangive;andmuchgreatersecurityisfrequentlydemanded.\n347 [55] Inordertorestoreinsomemeasurethatfreecirculationoflabourwhich\nthose different statutes had almost entirely taken away, the invention of\ncertificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William III it was en-\nactedthatifanypersonshouldbringacertificatefromtheparishwherehe\nwaslastlegallysettled,subscribedbythechurchwardensandoverseersof\nthepoor, andallowedbytwojusticesofthepeace, thateveryotherparish\nshould be obliged to receive him; that he should not be removable merely\nupon account of his being likely to become chargeable, but only upon his\nbecomingactuallychargeable,andthatthentheparishwhichgrantedthe\ncertificate should be obliged to pay the expense both of his maintenance\nand of his removal. And in order to give the most perfect security to the\nparish where such certificated man should come to reside, it was further\nenacted by the same statute that he should gain no settlement there by\nany means whatever, except either by renting a tenement of ten pounds\na year, or by serving upon his own account in an annual parish office for\nonewholeyear;andconsequentlyneitherbynotice,norbyservice,norby\napprenticeship, nor by paying parish rates. By the 12th of Queen Anne,\ntoo, stat. 1, c.18, it was further enacted that neither the servants nor ap-\nprenticesofsuchcertificatedmanshouldgainanysettlementintheparish\nwhereheresidedundersuchcertificate.\n348 [56] Howfarthisinventionhasrestoredthatfreecirculationoflabourwhich\n113", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntheprecedingstatuteshadalmostentirelytakenaway,wemaylearnfrom\nthe following very judicious observation of Doctor Burn. \u2018It is obvious,\u2019\nsays he, \u2018that there are divers good reasons for requiring certificates with\npersonscomingtosettleinanyplace;namely,thatpersonsresidingunder\nthemcangainnosettlement,neitherbyapprenticeship,norbyservice,nor\nby giving notice, nor by paying parish rates; that they can settle neither\napprentices nor servants; that if they become chargeable, it is certainly\nknown whither to remove them, and the parish shall be paid for the re-\nmoval, and for their maintenance in the meantime; and that if they fall\nsick, and cannot be removed, the parish which gave the certificate must\nmaintain them: none of all which can be without a certificate. Which\nreasons will hold proportionably for parishes not granting certificates in G.ed.p156\nordinary cases; for it is far more than an equal chance, but that they will\nhavethecertificatedpersonsagain,andinaworsecondition.\u2019 Themoralof\nthis observation seems to be that certificates ought always to be required\nby the parish where any poor man comes to reside, and that they ought\nvery seldom to be granted by that which he proposes to leave. \u2018There is\nsomewhatofhardshipinthismatterofcertificates,\u2019saysthesameveryin-\ntelligentauthorinhisHistoryofthePoorLaws,\u2018byputtingitinthepower\nof a parish officer to imprison a man as it were for life; however incon-\nvenient it may be for him to continue at that place where he has had the\nmisfortune to acquire what is called a settlement, or whatever advantage\nhemayproposetohimselfbylivingelsewhere\u2019.\n349 [57] Though a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good beha-\nviour, and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish to\nwhichhereallydoesbelong,itisaltogetherdiscretionaryintheparishof-\nficerseithertograntortorefuseit.

Asingleman,\nindeed, who is healthy and industrious, may sometimes reside by suffer-\nance without one; but a man with a wife and family who should attempt\ntodosowouldinmostparishesbesureofbeingremoved,andifthesingle\nman should afterwards marry, he would generally be removed likewise.\nThe scarcity of hands in one parish, therefore, cannot always be relieved\nbytheirsuperabundanceinanother,asitisconstantlyinScotland,and,I\nbelieve,inallothercountrieswherethereisnodifficultyofsettlement. In\nsuchcountries,thoughwagesmaysometimesrisealittleintheneighbour-\nhoodofagreattown,orwhereverelsethereisanextraordinarydemandfor\nlabour, and sink gradually as the distance from such places increases, till\nthey fall back to the common rate of the country; yet we never meet with\n114", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthosesuddenandunaccountabledifferencesinthewagesofneighbouring\nplaceswhichwesometimesfindinEngland,whereitisoftenmoredifficult G.ed.p157\nfor a poor man to pass the artificial boundary of a parish than an arm of\ntheseaoraridgeofhighmountains,naturalboundarieswhichsometimes\nseparateverydistinctlydifferentratesofwagesinothercountries.\n351 [59] To remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour from the par-\nish where he chooses to reside is an evident violation of natural liberty\nand justice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their\nliberty, but like the common people of most other countries never rightly\nunderstanding wherein it consists, have now for more than a century to-\ngethersufferedthemselvestobeexposedtothisoppressionwithoutarem-\nedy.

Thus the 8th of\nGeorge III prohibits under heavy penalties all master tailors in London,\nand five miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from accepting,\nmore than two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a day, except in the\ncase of a general mourning. Whenever the legislature attempts to regu-\nlate the differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors\narealwaysthemasters. Whentheregulation,therefore,isinfavourofthe G.ed.p158\nworkmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise\nwheninfavourofthemasters.

Itimposesnorealhardshipuponthemasters.\nIt only obliges them to pay that value in money, which they pretended to\npay, but did not always really pay, in goods. This law is in favour of the\nworkmen: butthe8thofGeorgeIIIisinfavourofthemasters. Whenmas-\nterscombinetogetherinordertoreducethewagesoftheirworkmen,they\ncommonly enter into a private bond or agreement not to give more than\na certain wage under a certain penalty. Were the workmen to enter into\n115", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\na contrary combination of the same kind, not to accept of a certain wage\nunder a certain penalty, the law would punish them very severely; and if\nit dealt impartially, it would treat the masters in the same manner. But\nthe 8th of George III enforces by law that very regulation which masters\nsometimes attempt to establish by such combinations. The complaint of\ntheworkmen, thatitputstheablestandmostindustriousuponthesame\nfootingwithanordinaryworkman,seemsperfectlywellfounded.\n354 [62] In ancient times, too, it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of\nmerchants and other dealers, by rating the price both of provisions and\nother goods.

In the greater part of the towns of Scotland, how-\never, there is an incorporation of bakers who claim exclusive privileges,\nthoughtheyarenotverystrictlyguarded.\n355 [63] The proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit\nin the different employments of labour and stock, seems not to be much G.ed.p159\naffected, as has already been observed, by the riches or poverty, the ad-\nvancing, stationary, or declining state of the society.

In adjusting the terms of the lease, the landlord endeavours\nto leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to\nkeep up the stock from which he furnishes the seed, pays the labour, and\npurchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry,\ntogether with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood.\nThis is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content\nhimself without being a loser, and the landlord seldom means to leave\nhim any more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the same thing,\nwhatever part of its price is over and above this share, he naturally en-\ndeavours to reserve to himself as the rent of his land, which is evidently\nthehighestthetenantcanaffordtopayintheactualcircumstancesofthe\nland. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more frequently the ignorance, of\nthe landlord, makes him accept of somewhat less than this portion; and\nsometimestoo,thoughmorerarely,theignoranceofthetenantmakeshim\nundertake to pay somewhat more, or to content himself with somewhat\nlessthantheordinaryprofitsoffarmingstockintheneighbourhood.

This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occa-\nsions; for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case. The landlord\ndemands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or\nprofit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this\noriginal rent. Those improvements, besides, are not always made by the\nstockofthelandlord,butsometimesbythatofthetenant.

The rent increases\nin proportion to the goodness of the pasture. The same extent of ground\nnot only maintains a greater number of cattle, but as they are brought\nwithinasmallercompass,lesslabourbecomesrequisitetotendthem,and\nto collect their produce. The landlord gains both ways, by the increase of\ntheproduceandbythediminutionofthelabourwhichmustbemaintained\noutofit.\n368 [4] The rent of land not only varies with its fertility, whatever be its pro-\nduce, but with its situation, whatever be its fertility. Land in the neigh-\nbourhood of a town gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in a dis-\ntant part of the country. Though it may cost no more labour to cultivate\nthe one than the other, it must always cost more to bring the produce of\nthedistantlandtomarket. Agreaterquantityoflabour,therefore,mustbe\nmaintainedoutofit;andthesurplus,fromwhicharedrawnboththeprofit\nofthefarmerandtherentofthelandlord,mustbediminished. Butinre-\n119", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmote parts of the country the rate of profits, as has already been shown,\nis generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a large town. A smaller\nproportion of this diminished surplus, therefore, must belong to the land-\nlord.\n369 [5] Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense\nof carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level\nwith those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account\nthe greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the\nremote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country.\nTheyareadvantageoustothetown,bybreakingdownthemonopolyofthe\ncountryinitsneighbourhood.

Itisnot\nmore than fifty years ago that some of the counties in the neighbourhood\nofLondonpetitionedtheParliamentagainsttheextensionoftheturnpike\nroads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pretended,\nfrom the cheapness of labour, would be able to sell their grass and corn\ncheaperintheLondonmarketthanthemselves,andwouldtherebyreduce\ntheir rents, and ruin their cultivation. Their rents, however, have risen,\nandtheircultivationhasbeenimprovedsincethattime.\n370 [6] A cornfield of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of\nfoodformanthanthebestpastureofequalextent. Thoughitscultivation\nrequiresmuchmorelabour,yetthesurpluswhichremainsafterreplacing\nthe seed and maintaining all that labour, is likewise much greater.

It seems to have done so universally in the rude\nbeginningsofagriculture.\n371 [7] Buttherelativevaluesofthosetwodifferentspeciesoffood,breadand\nbutcher\u2019s meat, are very different in the different periods of agriculture.\nIn its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then occupy the far\ngreater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle. There is more\nbutcher\u2019smeatthanbread,andbread,therefore,isthefoodforwhichthere\nis the greatest competition, and which consequently brings the greatest\nprice. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four reals, one-and-twenty\npence halfpenny sterling, was, forty or fifty years ago, the ordinary price\nof an ox, chosen from a herd of two or three hundred. He says nothing of\nthe price of bread, probably because he found nothing remarkable about\nit. An ox there, he says, cost little more than the labour of catching him.\nBut corn can nowhere be raised without a great deal of labour, and in a\ncountry which lies upon the river Plate, at that time the direct road from\n120", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nEuropetothesilverminesofPotosi,themoneypriceoflabourcouldnotbe\nvery cheap. It is otherwise when cultivation is extended over the greater\npart of the country. There is then more bread than butcher\u2019s meat. The\ncompetitionchangesitsdirection,andthepriceofbutcher\u2019smeatbecomes\ngreaterthanthepriceofbread.\n372 [8] By the extension besides of cultivation, the unimproved wilds become G.ed.p165\ninsufficient to supply the demand for butcher\u2019s meat.

The cattle\nbred upon the most uncultivated moors, when brought to the same mar-\nket, are, in proportion to their weight or goodness, sold at the same price\nas those which are reared upon the most improved land. The proprietors\nof those moors profit by it, and raise the rent of their land in proportion\ntothepriceoftheircattle.

If it was\nmorethancompensated,morecornlandwouldbeturnedintopasture;and\nif it was not compensated, part of what was in pasture would be brought\nbackintocorn.\n374 [10] This equality, however, between the rent and profit of grass and those\nofcorn;ofthelandofwhichtheimmediateproduceisfoodforcattle,andof\nthat of which the immediate produce is food for men; must be understood\ntotakeplaceonlythroughthegreaterpartoftheimprovedlandsofagreat\ncountry. In some particular local situations it is quite otherwise, and the\nrentandprofitofgrassaremuchsuperiortowhatcanbemadebycorn.\n375 [11] Thus in the neighbourhood of a great town the demand for milk and\nfor forage to horses frequently contribute, together with the high price of\nbutcher\u2019smeat,toraisethevalueofgrassabovewhatmaybecalleditsnat- G.ed.p166\nural proportion to that of corn. This local advantage, it is evident, cannot\nbecommunicatedtothelandsatadistance.\n121", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n376 [12] Particular circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so\npopulousthatthewholeterritory,likethelandsintheneighbourhoodofa\ngreattown,hasnotbeensufficienttoproduceboththegrassandthecorn\nnecessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants. Their lands, therefore,\nhavebeenprincipallyemployedintheproductionofgrass,themorebulky\ncommodity, and which cannot be so easily brought from a great distance;\nandcorn,thefoodofthegreatbodyofthepeople,hasbeenchieflyimported\nfrom foreign countries. Holland is at present in this situation, and a con-\nsiderablepartofancientItalyseemstohavebeensoduringtheprosperity\nof the Romans. To feed well, old Cato said, as we are told by Cicero, was\nthefirstandmostprofitablethinginthemanagementofaprivateestate;\nto feed tolerably well, the second; and to feed ill, the third.

Tillage, in-\ndeed,inthatpartofancientItalywhichlayintheneighbourhoodofRome,\nmusthavebeenverymuchdiscouragedbythedistributionsofcornwhich\nwere frequently made to the people, either gratuitously, or at a very low\nprice.

The low price at\nwhich this corn was distributed to the people must necessarily have sunk\nthe price of what could be brought to the Roman market from Latium, or\nthe ancient territory of Rome, and must have discouraged its cultivation\ninthatcountry.\n377 [13] In an open country too, of which the principal produce is corn, a well-\nenclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn field in\nits neighbourhood. It is convenient for the maintenance of the cattle em- G.ed.p167\nployed in the cultivation of the corn, and its high rent is, in this case, not\nsoproperlypaidfromthevalueofitsownproduceasfromthatofthecorn\nlands which are cultivated by means of it. It is likely to fall, if ever the\nneighbouring lands are completely enclosed. The present high rent of en-\nclosed land in Scotland seems owing to the scarcity of enclosure, and will\nprobably last no longer than that scarcity. The advantage of enclosure\nis greater for pasture than for corn. It saves the labour of guarding the\ncattle, which feed better, too, when they are not liable to be disturbed by\ntheirkeeperorhisdog.\n378 [14] But where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit\nofcorn,orwhateverelseisthecommonvegetablefoodorthepeople,must\nnaturallyregulate,uponthelandwhichisfitforproducingit,therentand\nprofitofpasture.\n379 [15] The use of the artificial grasses, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the\nother expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quant-\nity of land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass,\nshould somewhat reduce, it might be expected, the superiority which, in\nanimprovedcountry,thepriceofbutcher\u2019smeatnaturallyhasoverthatof\nbread.

The rent and\nprofit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land. If\nany particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be turned into\ncornorpasture;andifanyaffordedmore,somepartofthelandsincornor\npasturewouldsoonbeturnedtothatproduce.\n123", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n388 [24] Those productions, indeed, which require either a greater original ex- G.ed.p169\npenseofimprovement,oragreaterannualexpenseofcultivation,inorder\ntofitthelandforthem,appearcommonlytoafford,theoneagreaterrent,\nthe other a greater profit than corn or pasture.

In the ancient husbandry,\nafterthevineyard, awell-wateredkitchengardenseemstohavebeenthe\npart of the farm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce.\nBut Democritus, who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years\nago,andwhowasregardedbytheancientsasoneofthefathersoftheart,\nthoughttheydidnotactwiselywhoenclosedakitchengarden. Theprofit,\nhesaid, wouldnotcompensatetheexpenseofastonewall; andbricks(he\nmeant, I suppose, bricks baked in the sun) mouldered with the rain, and\nthe winter storm, and required continual repairs. Columella, who reports\nthis judgment of Democritus, does not controvert it, but proposes a very\nfrugal method of enclosing with a hedge of brambles and briars, which,\nhe says, he had found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenet-\nrable fence; but which, it seems, was not commonly known in the time of\nDemocritus. Palladius adopts the opinion of Columella, which had before G.ed.p170\nbeenrecommendedbyVarro. Inthejudgmentofthoseancientimprovers,\nthe produce of a kitchen garden had, it seems, been little more than suf-\nficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expense of watering; for\nin countries so near the sun, it was thought proper, in those times as in\nthe present, to have the command of a stream of water which could be\nconductedtoeverybedinthegarden.

Butwhetheritwasadvantageoustoplantanewvineyard\nwas a matter of dispute among the ancient Italian husbandmen, as we\nlearn from Columella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious cultiva-\ntion, in favour of the vineyard, and endeavours to show, by a comparison\nof the profit and expense, that it was a most advantageous improvement.\nSuchcomparisons,however,betweentheprofitandexpenseofnewprojects\narecommonlyveryfallacious,andinnothingmoresothaninagriculture.\nHadthegainactuallymadebysuchplantationsbeencommonlyasgreatas\nheimagineditmighthavebeen,therecouldhavebeennodisputeaboutit.\nThesamepointisfrequentlyatthisdayamatterofcontroversyinthewine\ncountries. Their writers on agriculture, indeed, the lovers and promoters\nof high cultivation, seem generally disposed to decide with Columella in\nfavour of the vineyard. In France the anxiety of the proprietors of the old G.ed.p171\nvineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones, seems to favour their\nopinion, and to indicate a consciousness in those who must have the ex-\nperiencethatthisspeciesofcultivationisatpresentinthatcountrymore\nprofitable thanany other. Itseems at the same time, however, toindicate\nanotheropinion, thatthissuperiorprofitcanlastnolongerthanthelaws\nwhichatpresentrestrainthefreecultivationofthevine.

The pretence of this order was the scarcity of\ncorn and pasture, and the superabundance of wine. But had this super-\nabundance been real, it would, without any order of council, have effectu-\nally prevented the plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of\nthis species of cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn\nand pasture. With regard to the supposed scarcity of corn, occasioned by\nthe multiplication of vineyards, corn is nowhere in France more carefully\ncultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for producing\nit; as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc.

If G.ed.p174\nthis be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it is as if a corn farmer expec-\nted to defray the expense of his cultivation with the chaff and the straw,\nand that the grain should be all clear profit.

When food is provided, it is easy to find the necessary cloth-\ning and lodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be difficult\nto find food. In some parts even of the British dominions what is called\na house may be built by one day\u2019s labour of one man.

These qualities of\nutility, beauty, and scarcity, are the original foundation of the high price\nof those metals, or of the great quantity of other goods for which they can\neverywherebeexchanged. Thisvaluewasantecedenttoandindependent\nof their being employed as coin, and was the quality which fitted them\nfor that employment. That employment, however, by occasioning a new\ndemand,andbydiminishingthequantitywhichcouldbeemployedinany\nother way, may have afterwards contributed to keep up or increase their\nvalue.\n438 [32] Thedemandforthepreciousstonesarisesaltogetherfromtheirbeauty.\nThey are of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is\ngreatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and expense of get-\nting them from the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon\nmost occasions, almost the whole of their high price. Rent comes in but\nforaverysmallshare;frequentlyfornoshare;andthemostfertilemines\nonly afford any considerable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, visited the\ndiamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, he was informed that the sov-\nereign of the country, for whose benefit they were wrought, had ordered\nall of them to be shut up, except those which yield the largest and finest\nstones. Theothers,itseems,weretotheproprietornotworththeworking.\n439 [33] As the price both of the precious metals and of the precious stones is\nregulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in it,\nthe rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in propor-\ntion, not to its absolute, but to what may be called its relative fertility, or\nto its superiority over other mines of the same kind. If new mines were\ndiscovered as much superior to those of Potosi as they were superior to\nthose Europe, the value of silver might be so much degraded as to render\n139", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\neven the mines of Potosi not worth the working. Before the discovery of\nthe Spanish West Indies, the most fertile mines in Europe may have af-\nforded as great a rent to their proprietor as the richest mines in Peru do\nat present.

The land which produces a certain quantity of food, cloaths, and\nlodging, can always feed, clothe, and lodge a certain number of people;\nand whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will always give\nhim a proportionable command of the labour of those people, and of the\ncommodities with which that labour can supply him. The value of the\nmost barren lands is not diminished by the neighbourhood of the most\nfertile. On the contrary, it is generally increased by it.

That abundance of food, of which, in con-\nsequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal bey-\nond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the demand\nboth for the precious metals and the precious stone, as well as for every\nother conveniency and ornament of dress, lodging, household furniture,\nandequipage.

They were G.ed.p193\nastonished to observe the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had\nno notion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people\nhad the disposal of so great a superfluity of food, so scanty always among\nthemselves,thatforaverysmallquantityofthoseglitteringbaublesthey\nwould willingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for many\nyears.

Inthewholeprogressofimprovement,itmightthere-\nfore be expected, there should be only one variation in the comparative\nvaluesofthosetwodifferentsortsofproduce. Thevalueofthatsortwhich\nsometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent, should constantly\nrise in proportion to that which always affords some rent. As art and in-\ndustry advance, the materials of clothing and lodging, the useful fossils\nand minerals of the earth, the precious metals and the precious stones\nshould gradually come to be more and more in demand, should gradually\nexchange for a greater and a greater quantity of food, or in other words,\nshouldgraduallybecomedeareranddearer. Thisaccordinglyhasbeenthe\ncase with most of these things upon most occasions, and would have been\nthecasewithallofthemuponalloccasions,ifparticularaccidentshadnot\nuponsomeoccasionsincreasedthesupplyofsomeoftheminastillgreater\nproportionthanthedemand.\n[2] Thevalueofafree-stonequarry,forexample,willnecessarilyincrease\n444\nwith the increasing improvement and population of the country round\nabout it, especially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood.

Unless the world in gen-\neral,therefore,beadvancinginimprovementandpopulation,thedemand\nforsilvermightnotbeatallincreasedbytheimprovementevenofalarge\ncountry in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in gen-\neral were improving, yet if, in the course of its improvement, new mines\nshould be discovered, much more fertile than any which had been known\nbefore, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase, yet the\nsupply might increase in so much a greater proportion that the real price\nof that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a pound\nweightofit,forexample,mightgraduallypurchaseorcommandasmaller\nand a smaller quantity of labour, or exchange for a smaller and a smaller\nquantityofcorn,theprincipalpartofthesubsistenceofthelabourer.\n445 [3] The great market for silver is the commercial and civilised part of the\nworld.\n446 [4] If by the general progress of improvement the demand of this market\nshouldincrease,whileatthesametimethesupplydidnotincreaseinthe\nsame proportion, the value of silver would gradually rise in proportion to\nthatofcorn. Anygivenquantityofsilverwouldexchangeforagreaterand\na greater quantity of corn; or, in other words, the average money price of\ncornwouldgraduallybecomecheaperandcheaper.\n447 [5] If, on the contrary, the supply by some accident should increase for\nmanyyearstogetherinagreaterproportionthanthedemand,thatmetal\nwould gradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the av-\nerage money price of corn would, in spite of all improvements, gradually\nbecomedeareranddearer.\n448 [6] Butif,ontheotherhand,thesupplyofthemetalshouldincreasenearly\nin the same proportion as the demand, it would continue to purchase or\nexchange for nearly the same quantity of corn, and the average money\npriceofcornwould,inspiteofallimprovements,continueverynearlythe\nsame.\n449 [7] These three seem to exhaust all the possible combinations of events\nwhich can happen in the progress of improvement; and during the course\nof the four centuries preceding the present, if we may judge by what has\nhappened both in France and Great Britain, each of those three differ-\nent combinations seem to have taken place in the European market, and G.ed.p195\nnearlyinthesameorder,too,inwhichIhaveheresetthemdown.\n142", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nDigression concerning the Variations in the\nValue of Silver during the Course of the Four\nlast Centuries\nFIRST PERIOD\n450 [1] In1350,andforsometimebefore,theaveragepriceofthequarterofwheat\nin England seems not to have been estimated lower than four ounces of\nsilver,Towerweight,equaltoabouttwentyshillingsofourpresentmoney.\nFrom this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of silver,\nequal to about ten shillings of our present money, the price at which we\nfinditestimatedinthebeginningofthesixteenthcentury,andatwhichit\nseemstohavecontinuedtobeestimatedtillabout1570.\n451 [2] In 1350, being the 25th of Edward III, was enacted what is called The\nStatute of Labourers. In the preamble it complains much of the insolence\nof servants, who endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters. It\ntherefore ordains that all servants and labourers should for the future be\ncontented with the same wages and liveries (liveries in those times signi-\nfied not only cloaths but provisions) which they had been accustomed to\nreceive in the 20th year of the king, and the four preceding years; that\nupon this account their livery wheat should nowhere be estimated higher\nthan tenpence a bushel, and that it should always be in the option of the\nmastertodeliverthemeitherthewheatorthemoney.

There are, besides, other reasons for believing\nthat in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and for some time before,\n143", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe common price of wheat was not less than four ounces of silver the\nquarter,andthatofothergraininproportion.\n453 [4] In 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St. Augustine\u2019s, Canterbury, gave a\nfeastuponhisinstallation-day, ofwhichWilliamThornhaspreservednot\nonly the bill of fare but the prices of many particulars. In that feast were\nconsumed,first,fifty-threequartersofwheat,whichcostnineteenpounds,\nor seven shillings and twopence a quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty\nshillings and sixpence of our present money; secondly, fifty-eight quar-\nters of malt, which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings\na quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money; thirdly,\ntwentyquartersofoats,whichcostfourpounds,orfourshillingsaquarter,\nequal to about twelve shillings of our present money. The prices of malt\nandoatsseemheretobehigherthantheirordinaryproportiontotheprice\nofwheat.\n454 [5] These prices are not recorded on account of their extraordinary dear-\nness or cheapness, but are mentioned accidentally as the prices actually\npaid for large quantities of grain consumed at a feast which was famous\nforitsmagnificence.\n455 [6] In 1262, being the 51st of Henry III, was revived an ancient statute\ncalled The Assize of Bread and Ale, which the king says in the preamble\nhad been made in the times of his progenitors, sometime kings of Eng-\nland. Itisprobably,therefore,asoldatleastasthetimeofhisgrandfather G.ed.p197\nHenry II, and may have been as old as the Conquest.

In one of them\nit iscomputed atsix shillingsand eight-pencethe quarter, in the otherat\nfive shillings and eight-pence only. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence\ncontainedonlytwoouncesofsilver,Tower-weight,andwereequaltoabout\ntenshillingsofourpresentmoney.\n459 [10] From the 25th of Edward III to the beginning of the reign of Eliza-\nbeth, during the space of more than two hundred years, six shillings and\neight-pence, it appears from several different statutes, had continued to G.ed.p198\nbe considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable, that is the\nordinary or average price of wheat. The quantity of silver, however, con-\ntained in that nominal sum was, during the course of this period, con-\ntinuallydiminishing,inconsequenceofsomealterationswhichweremade\nin the coin. But the increase of the value of silver had, it seems, so far\ncompensated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the same\nnominalsumthatthelegislaturedidnotthinkitworthwhiletoattendto\nthiscircumstance.\n460 [11] Thus in 1436 it was enacted that wheat might be exported without a\nlicence when the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence; and in\n1463 it was enacted that no wheat should be imported if the price was\nnot above six shillings and eightpence the quarter. The legislature had\nimagined that when the price was so low there could be no inconveniency\nin exportation, but that when it rose higher it became prudent to allow\nimportation. Sixshillingsandeightpence, therefore, containingaboutthe\nsame quantity of silver as thirteen shillings and fourpence of our present\nmoney (one third part less than the same nominal sum contained in the\ntime of Edward III), had in those times been considered as what is called\nthemoderateandreasonablepriceofwheat.\n461 [12] In 1554, by the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary; and in 1558, by the\n1st of Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the same manner pro-\nhibited, whenever the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and\neight-pence, which didnot thencontain two pennyworthmore silverthan\nthesamenominalsumdoesatpresent. Butithadsoonbeenfoundthatto\nrestraintheexportationofwheattillthepricewassoverylowwas,inreal-\nity,toprohibititaltogether.

This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for\nthetenant,andmuchmoreconvenientforthelandlord,toconvert,asthey\ncall it, the corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of the\nfiarsofeachyear,thanatanycertainfixedprice. Butthewriterswhohave\ncollected the prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to have mis- G.ed.p201\ntakenwhatiscalledinScotlandtheconversionpricefortheactualmarket\nprice. Fleetwood acknowledges, upon one occasion, that he had made this\nmistake. As he wrote his book, however, for a particular purpose, he does\nnot think proper to make this acknowledgment till after transcribing this\nconversion price fifteen times. The price is eight shillings the quarter of\nwheat. This sum in 1423, the year at which he begins with it, contained\nthe same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings of our present money. But\nin 1562, the year at which he ends with it, it contained no more than the\nsamenominalsumdoesatpresent.\n467 [18] Secondly,theyhavebeenmisledbytheslovenlymannerinwhichsome\nancientstatutesofassizehadbeensometimestranscribedbylazycopiers;\nandsometimesperhapsactuallycomposedbythelegislature.\n468 [19] Theancientstatutesofassizeseemtohavebegunalwayswithdeterm-\nining what ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat\nandbarleywereatthelowest,andtohaveproceededgraduallytodeterm-\nine what it ought to be, according as the prices of those two sorts of grain G.ed.p202\nshouldgraduallyriseabovethislowestprice. Butthetranscribersofthose\nstatutes seem frequently to have thought it sufficient to copy the regu-\nlation as far as the three or four first and lowest prices, saving in this\nmannertheir ownlabour, andjudging, I suppose, that thiswas enoughto\nshowwhatproportionoughttobeobservedinallhigherprices.\n469 [20] ThusintheAssizeofBreadandAle,ofthe51stofHenryIII,theprice\nof bread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat, from\none shilling to twenty shillings the quarter, of the money of those times.\nBut in the manuscripts from which all the different editions of the stat-\nutes, preceding that of Mr. Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had never\ntranscribed this regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings. Several\nwriters, therefore, being misled by this faulty transcription, very natur-\nally concluded that the middle price, or six shillings the quarter, equal to\nabouteighteenshillingsofourpresentmoney,wastheordinaryoraverage\npriceofwheatatthattime.\n470 [21] In the Statute of Tumbrel and Pillory, enacted nearly about the same\ntime, the price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence rise in the\n147", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nprice of barley, from two shillings to four shillings the quarter. That four\nshillings,however,wasnotconsideredasthehighestpricetowhichbarley\nmightfrequentlyriseinthosetimes,andthatthesepriceswereonlygiven\nas an example of the proportion which ought to be observed in all other\nprices, whether higher or lower, we may infer from the last words of the\nstatute: et sic deinceps crescetur vel diminuetur per sex denarios. The\nexpression is very slovenly, but the meaning is plain enough: \u2018That the\nprice of ale is in this manner to be increased or diminished according to\neverysixpenceriseorfallinthepriceofbarley\u2019. Inthecompositionofthis\nstatutethelegislatureitselfseemstohavebeenasnegligentasthecopiers\nwereinthetranscriptionoftheother.\n471 [22] InanancientmanuscriptoftheRegiamMajestatem,anoldScotchlaw\nbook,thereisastatuteofassizeinwhichthepriceofbreadisregulatedac-\ncordingtoallthedifferentpricesofwheat,fromtenpencetothreeshillings\nthe Scotch boll, equal to about half an English quarter. Three shillings\nScotch,atthetimewhenthisassizeissupposedtohavebeenenactedwere\nequaltoaboutnineshillingssterlingofourpresentmoney. Mr.Ruddiman G.ed.p203\nseems3 to conclude from this, that three shillings was the highest price\nto which wheat ever rose in those times, and that tenpence, a shilling, or\nat most two shillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon consulting the ma-\nnuscript, however, it appears evidently that all these prices are only set\ndown as examples of the proportion which ought to be observed between\nthe respective prices of wheat and bread. The last words of the statute\nare: reliqua judicabis secundum proescripta habendo respectum ad pre-\ntium bladi. \u2018You shall judge of the remaining cases according to what is\nabovewritten,havingarespecttothepriceofcorn.\u2019\n472 [23] Thirdly, they seem to have been misled, too, by the very low price at\nwhich wheat was sometimes sold in very ancient times; and to have ima-\ngined that as its lowest price was then much lower than in later times,\nits ordinary price must likewise have been much lower. They might have\nfound, however, that in those ancient times its highest price was fully as\nmuch above, as its lowest price was below anything that had even been\nknown in later times. Thus in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the\nquarterofwheat. Theoneisfourpoundssixteenshillingsofthemoneyof\nthosetimes,equaltofourteenpoundseightshillingsofthatofthepresent;\ntheotherissixpoundseightshillings,equaltonineteenpoundsfourshil-\nlings of our present money.

Attheendofeach\ndivision, too, he will find the average price of the twelve years of which\nit consists. In that long period of time, Fleetwood has been able to collect\nthe prices of no more than eighty years, so that four years are wanting to\nmakeoutthelasttwelveyears. Ihaveadded,therefore,fromtheaccounts\nof Eton college, the prices of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601. It is the only\naddition which I have made. The reader will see that from the beginning\nofthethirteenthtillafterthemiddleofthesixteenthcenturytheaverage\nprice of each twelve years grows gradually lower and lower; and that to-\nwards the end of the sixteenth century it begins to rise again. The prices,\nindeed,whichFleetwoodhasbeenabletocollect,seemtohavebeenthose\nchiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary dearness or cheapness;\nand I do not pretend that any very certain conclusion can be drawn from\nthem. So far, however, as they prove anything at all, they confirm the\naccountwhichI havebeenendeavouring togive.

Corn,\nit has been said, being a sort of manufacture, was, in those rude ages,\nmuchdearerinproportionthanthegreaterpartofothercommodities;itis\nmeant, I suppose, than the greater part of unmanufactured commodities,\nsuchascattle,poultry,gameofallkinds,etc. Thatinthosetimesofpoverty\nand barbarism these were proportionably much cheaper than corn is un-\n149", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndoubtedly true. But this cheapness was not the effect of the high value\nof silver, but of the low value of those commodities. It was not because\nsilver would in such times purchase or represent a greater quantity of la-\nbour, but because such commodities would purchase or represent a much\nsmaller quantity than in times of more opulence and improvement. Sil-\nver must certainly be cheaper in Spanish America than in Europe; in the\ncountry where it is produced than in the country to which it is brought,\nattheexpenseofalongcarriagebothbylandandbysea, ofafreightand\nan insurance.

In a country naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is\naltogetheruncultivated,cattle,poultry,gameofallkinds,etc.,astheycan\nbe acquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will purchase or\ncommand but a very small quantity. The low money price for which they G.ed.p206\nmaybesoldisnoproofthattherealvalueofsilveristhereveryhigh,but\nthattherealvalueofthosecommoditiesisverylow.\n475 [26] Labour, it must always be remembered, and not any particular com-\nmodityorsetofcommodities,istherealmeasureofthevaluebothofsilver\nandofallothercommodities.\n476 [27] But in countries almost waste, or but thinly inhabited, cattle, poultry,\ngameofallkinds,etc.,astheyarethespontaneousproductionsofnature,\nsoshefrequentlyproducestheminmuchgreaterquantitiesthanthecon-\nsumptionoftheinhabitantsrequires. Insuchastateofthingsthesupply\ncommonly exceeds the demand. In different states of society, in different\nstages of improvement, therefore, such commodities will represent, or be\nequivalentto,verydifferentquantitiesoflabour.\n477 [28] In every state of society, in every stage of improvement, corn is the\nproduction of human industry. But the average produce of every sort of\nindustry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the average consump-\ntion;theaveragesupplytotheaveragedemand. Ineverydifferentstageof\nimprovement, besides, the raising of equal quantities of corn in the same\nsoil and climate will, at an average, require nearly equal quantities of la-\nbour;orwhatcomestothesamething,thepriceofnearlyequalquantities;\nthe continual increase of the productive powers of labour in an improving\nstate of cultivation being more or less counterbalanced by the continually\nincreasing price of cattle, the principal instruments of agriculture. Upon\nall these accounts, therefore, we may rest assured that equal quantities\nof corn will, in every state of society, in every stage of improvement, more\nnearlyrepresent,orbeequivalentto,equalquantitiesoflabourthanequal\nquantitiesofanyotherpartoftherudeproduceofland. Corn,accordingly,\nit has already been observed, is, in all the different stages of wealth and\nimprovement, a more accurate measure of value than any other commod-\nity or set of commodities. In all those different stages, therefore, we can\n150", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\njudge better of the real value of silver by comparing it with corn than by\ncomparingitwithanyothercommodityorsetofcommodities.\n478 [29] Corn, besides, orwhateverelseisthecommonandfavouritevegetable\nfoodofthepeople,constitutes,ineverycivilisedcountry,theprincipalpart\nofthesubsistenceofthelabourer.

In France, and even\nin Scotland, where labour is somewhat better rewarded than in France,\nthe labouring poor seldom eat butcher\u2019s meat, except upon holidays, and\nother extraordinary occasions. The money price of labour, therefore, de-\npendsmuchmoreupontheaveragemoneypriceofcorn,thesubsistenceof\nthe labourer, than upon that of butcher\u2019s meat, or of any other part of the\nrudeproduceof land.

This\nnotion,however,seemstobealtogethergroundless.\n480 [31] The quantity of the precious metals may increase in any country from\ntwo different causes; either, first, from the increased abundance of the\nmines which supply it; or, secondly, from the increased wealth of the\npeople, from the increased produce of their annual labour. The first of\nthese causes is no doubt necessarily connected with the diminution of the\nvalueofthepreciousmetals,butthesecondisnot.\n481 [32] When more abundant mines are discovered, a greater quantity of the\nprecious metals is brought to market, and the quantity of the necessaries\nandconvenienciesoflifeforwhichtheymustbeexchangedbeingthesame\nas before, equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller\nquantitiesofcommodities. Sofar,therefore,astheincreaseofthequantity\nofthepreciousmetalsinanycountryarisesfromtheincreasedabundance\nof the mines, it is necessarily connected with some diminution of their\nvalue.\n482 [33] When, on the contrary, the wealth of any country increases, when the\nannual produce of its labour becomes gradually greater and greater, a G.ed.p208\ngreater quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater\nquantityofcommodities;andthepeople,astheycanaffordit,astheyhave\nmore commodities to give for it, will naturally purchase a greater and a\n151", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngreaterquantityofplate. Thequantityoftheircoinwillincreasefromne-\ncessity;thequantityoftheirplatefromvanityandostentation,orfromthe\nsamereasonthatthequantityoffinestatues,pictures,andofeveryother\nluxury and curiosity, is likely to increase among them. But as statuaries\nand painters are not likely to be worse rewarded in times of wealth and\nprosperity than in times of poverty and depression, so gold and silver are\nnotlikelytobeworsepaidfor.\n483 [34] The price of gold and silver, when the accidental discovery of more\nabundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally rises with the\nwealth of every country, so, whatever be the state of the mines, it is at\nalltimesnaturallyhigherinarichthaninapoorcountry. Goldandsilver,\nlikeallothercommodities,naturallyseekthemarketwherethebestprice\nis given for them, and the best price is commonly given for every thing\nin the country which can best afford it. Labour, it must be remembered,\nis the ultimate price which is paid for everything, and in countries where\nlabour is equally well regarded, the money price of labour will be in pro-\nportion to that of the subsistence of the labourer. But gold and silver will\nnaturally exchange for a greater quantity of subsistence in a rich than\nin a poor country, in a country which abounds with subsistence than in\none which is but indifferently supplied with it. If the two countries are\nat a great distance, the difference may be very great; because though the\nmetals naturally fly from the worse to the better market, yet it may be\ndifficulttotransporttheminsuchquantitiesastobringtheirpricenearly\nto a level in both. If the countries are near, the difference will be smaller,\nand may sometimes be scarce perceptible; because in this case the trans-\nportation will be easy. China is a much richer country than any part of\nEurope, and the difference between the price of subsistence in China and\ninEuropeisverygreat. RiceinChinaismuchcheaperthanwheatisany-\nwhere in Europe. England is a much richer country than Scotland; but\nthe difference between the money-price of corn in those two countries is\nmuch smaller, and is but just perceptible. In proportion to the quantity\nor measure, Scotch corn generally appears to be a good deal cheaper than\nEnglish; but in proportion to its quality, it is certainly somewhat dearer.\nScotlandreceivesalmosteveryyearverylargesuppliesfromEngland,and\nevery commodity must commonly be somewhat dearer in the country to\nwhichitisbroughtthaninthatfromwhichitcomes.

The money price of labour is lower in Scotland than\n152", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nin England because the real recompense of labour is much lower; Scot-\nland, though advancing to greater wealth, advancing much more slowly\nthan England. The frequency of emigration from Scotland, and the rarity\nof it from England, sufficiently prove that the demand for labour is very\ndifferent in the two countries. The proportion between the real recom-\npenseoflabourindifferentcountries,itmustberemembered,isnaturally\nregulated not by their actual wealth or poverty, but by their advancing,\nstationary,ordecliningcondition.\n485 [36] Gold and silver, as they are naturally of the greatest value among the\nrichest,sotheyarenaturallyoftheleastvalueamongthepoorestnations.\nAmongsavages,thepoorestofallnations,theyareofscarceanyvalue.\n486 [37] Ingreattownscornisalwaysdearerthanin remotepartsofthecoun-\ntry.

They\nare rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and manufacturers; in\nevery sort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge labour; in ship-\nping, and in all the other instruments and means of carriage and com-\nmerce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it must be brought to them\nfrom distant countries, must, by an addition to its price, pay for the car-\nriage from those countries. It does not cost less labour to bring silver to\nAmsterdam than to Dantzic; but it costs a great deal more to bring corn.\nThe real cost of silver must be nearly the same in both places; but that of\ncorn must be very different.

Itisaccountedforaccordinglyinthesamemannerbyeverybody;and\nthere never has been any dispute either about the fact or about the cause G.ed.p211\nof it. The greater part of Europe was, during this period, advancing in\nindustry and improvement, and the demand for silver must consequently\nhave been increasing. But the increase of the supply had, it seems, so far\nexceeded that of the demand, that the value of that metal sunk consider-\nably. The discovery of the mines of America, it is to be observed, does not\nseemtohavehadanyverysensibleeffectuponthepricesofthingsinEng-\nland till after 1570; though even the mines of Potosi had been discovered\nmorethantwentyyearsbefore.\n492 [4] From 1595 to 1620, both inclusive, the average price of the quarter\nof nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market appears, from the\naccounts of Eton College, to have been 2l.1s.6d. 9 . From which sum,\n13\nneglecting the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or 4s.7d.1, the price of\n3\nthe quarter of eight bushels comes out to have been 1l.16s.10d.2. And\n3\nfrom this sum, neglecting likewise the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or\n4s.1d.1, forthedifferencebetweenthepriceofthebestwheatandthatof\n9\nthe middle wheat, the price of the middle wheat comes out to have been\nabout1l.12s.8d.8,oraboutsixouncesandone-thirdofanounceofsilver.\n9\n493 [5] From1621to1636,bothinclusive,theaveragepriceofthesamemeas-\nureofthebestwheatatthesamemarketappears,fromthesameaccounts,\nto have been 2l.10s.; from which making the like deductions as in the\nforegoing case, the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle\n154", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwheat comes out to have been 1l.19s.6d., or about seven ounces and two-\nthirdsofanounceofsilver.\nTHIRD PERIOD\n494 [1] Between 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of the discovery of the\nminesofAmericainreducingthevalueofsilverappearstohavebeencom-\npleted, and the value of that metal seems never to have sunk lower in\nproportion to that of corn than it was about that time. It seems to have\nrisen somewhat in the course of the present century, and it had probably\nbeguntodosoevensometimebeforetheendofthelast.\n495 [2] From 1637 to 1700, both inclusive, being the sixty-four last years of\nthe last century, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the\nbest wheat at Windsor market appears, from the same accounts, to have\nbeen 2l.11s.0d.1; which is only 1s.0d.1 dearer than it had been during G.ed.p212\n3 3\nthe sixteen years before. But in the course of these sixty-four years there\nhappenedtwoeventswhichmusthaveproducedamuchgreaterscarcityof\ncornthanwhatthecourseoftheseasonswouldotherwisehaveoccasioned,\nandwhich,therefore,withoutsupposinganyfurtherreductioninthevalue\nofsilver,willmuchmorethanaccountforthisverysmallenhancementof\nprice.\n496 [3] The first of these events was the civil war, which, by discouraging till-\nage and interrupting commerce, must have raised the price of corn much\nabovewhatthecourseoftheseasonswouldotherwisehaveoccasioned. It\nmust have had this effect more or less at all the different markets in the\nkingdom,butparticularlyatthoseintheneighbourhoodofLondon,which\nrequire to be supplied from the greatest distance.

The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging\ntillage, may, in a long course of years, have occasioned a greater abund-\nance, and consequently a greater cheapness of corn in the home-market\nthan what would otherwise have taken place there. How far the bounty\ncould produce this effect at any time, I shall examine hereafter; I shall\nonly observe at present that, between 1688 and 1700, it had not time to\nproduceanysucheffect. Duringthisshortperioditsonlyeffectmusthave\nbeen,byencouragingtheexportationofthesurplusproduceofeveryyear,\n155", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nand thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compensating the\nscarcity of another, to raise the price in the home-market.

In 1699, accordingly, the further exportation of\ncornwasprohibitedforninemonths.\n498 [5] There was a third event which occurred in the course of the same\nperiod, and which, though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn, nor,\nperhaps, any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usu-\nally paid for it, must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in\nthenominalsum. Thiseventwasthegreatdebasementofthesilvercoin,\nby clipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the reign of Charles II\nand had gone on continually increasing till 1695; at which time, as we\nmay learn from Mr. Lowndes, the current silver coin was, at an average,\nnear five-and-twenty per cent below its standard value. But the nominal\nsum which constitutes the market price of every commodity is necessar-\nily regulated, not so much by the quantity of silver, which, according to\nthe standard, ought to be contained in it, as by that which, it is found by\nexperience,actuallyiscontainedinit. Thisnominalsum,therefore,isne-\ncessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and wearing\nthanwhenneartoitsstandardvalue.\n499 [6] Inthecourseofthepresentcentury,thesilvercoinhasnotatanytime\nbeen more below its standard weight than it is at present. But though\nvery much defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin for\nwhich it is exchanged. For though before the late recoinage, the gold coin\nwas a good deal defaced too, it was less so than the silver. In 1695, on\nthe contrary, the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold coin;\na guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty shillings of the worn and\ncliptsilver. Beforethelaterecoinageofthegold,thepriceofsilverbullion\nwas seldom higher than five shillings and sevenpence an ounce, which is\nbut fivepence above the mint price. But in 1695, the common price of sil-\nverbullionwassixshillingsandfivepenceanounce4,whichisfifteenpence\nabovethemintprice. Evenbeforethelaterecoinageofthegold,therefore,\nthecoin,goldandsilvertogether,whencomparedwithsilverbullion,was\nnot supposed to be more than eight per cent below its standard value.

Butinthebeginningofthepresentcentury,thatis,\nimmediatelyafterthegreatrecoinageinKingWilliam\u2019stime. thegreater\npart of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to its stand-\nard weight than it is at present. In the course of the present century, too,\ntherehasbeennogreatpubliccalamity,suchasthecivilwar,whichcould\neitherdiscouragetillage,orinterrupttheinteriorcommerceofthecountry.\n4[Smith]Lowndes\u2019sEssayontheSilverCoin,p.68.\n156", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nAndthoughthebounty,whichhastakenplacethroughthegreaterpartof\nthis century, must always raise the price of corn somewhat higher than it\notherwise would be in the actual state of tillage; yet as, in the course of\nthis century, the bounty has had full time to produce all the good effects\ncommonly imputed to it, to encourage tillage, and thereby to increase the\nquantity of corn in the home market, it may, upon the principles of a sys-\ntemwhichIshallexplainandexaminehereafter,besupposedtohavedone\nsomething to lower the price of that commodity the one way, as well as to\nraise it the other. It is by many people supposed to have done more. In\nthe sixty-four first years of the present century accordingly the average\nprice of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market\nappears, by the accounts of Eton College, to have been 2l.0s.6d.19, which\n32\nisabouttenshillingsandsixpence,ormorethanfive-and-twentypercent,\ncheaper than it had been during the sixty-four last years of the last cen-\ntury; andabout9s. 6d. cheaperthanithadbeenduringthesixteenyears\npreceding1636,whenthediscoveryoftheabundantminesofAmericamay\nbesupposedtohaveproduceditsfulleffect;andaboutoneshillingcheaper\nthan it had been in the twenty-six years preceding 1620, before that dis-\ncovery can well be supposed to have produced its full effect.

The country gentlemen, who then composed a still greater pro-\nportionofthelegislaturethantheydoatpresent,hadfeltthatthemoney\nprice of corn was falling. The bounty was an expedient to raise it artifi-\n157", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nciallytothehighpriceatwhichithadfrequentlybeensoldinthetimesof\nCharles I and II.

It must, however, have had some effect even upon the prices of\nmany of those years. By the extraordinary exportation which it occasions\nin years of plenty, it must frequently hinder the plenty of one year from\ncompensatingthescarcityofanother.\n507 [14] Both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty\nraises the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual\nstate of tillage.

Theseasonsforthesetenortwelveyearspasthave\nbeenunfavourablethroughthegreaterpartofEurope;andthedisordersof\nPolandhaveverymuchincreasedthescarcityinallthosecountrieswhich,\nin dear years, used to be supplied from that market. So long a course of\nbad seasons, though not a very common event, is by no means a singular\none; and whoever has inquired much into the history of the prices of corn\nin former times will be at no loss to recollect several other examples of\nthe same kind. Ten years of extraordinary scarcity, besides, are not more\nwonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty. The low price of corn\nfrom 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very well be set in opposition to\nitshighpriceduringtheselasteightortenyears. From1741to1750,the\naverage price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor\nmarket,itappearsfromtheaccountsofEtonCollege,wasonly1l.13s.9d.4,\n5\nwhich isnearly 6s.3d. below theaverage price ofthe sixty-four firstyears\nof the present century. The average price of the quarter of eight bushels\nofmiddlewheatcomesout,accordingtothisaccount,tohavebeen,during\nthesetenyears,only1l.6s.8d.\n511 [18] Between 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have hindered the\npriceofcornfromfallingsolowinthehomemarketasitnaturallywould\nhave done. During these ten years the quantity of all sorts of grain ex-\nported,itappearsfromthecustom-housebooks,amountedtonolessthan\neight millions twenty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty-six quarters\none bushel. The bounty paid for this amounted to 1,514,962l.17s.4d.1. In\n2\n1749accordingly,Mr.Pelham,atthattimePrimeMinister,observedtothe G.ed.p218\n159", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nHouse of Commons that for the three years preceding a very extraordin-\narysumhadbeenpaidasbountyfortheexportationofcorn. Hehadgood\nreason to make this observation, and in the following year he might have\nhad still better. In that single year the bounty paid amounted to no less\nthan 324,176l.10s.6d.5 It is unnecessary to observe how much this forced\nexportation must have raised the price of corn above what it otherwise\nwouldhavebeeninthehomemarket.\n512 [19] Attheendoftheaccountsannexedtothischapterthereaderwillfind\nthe particular account of those ten years separated from the rest. He will\nfindthere, too, theparticularaccountoftheprecedingtenyears, ofwhich\nthe average is likewise below, though not so much below, the general av-\nerage of the sixty-four first years of the century. The year 1740, however,\nwas a year of extraordinary scarcity. These twenty years preceding 1750\nmay very well be set in opposition to the twenty preceding 1770. As the\nformerwereagooddealbelowthegeneralaverageofthecentury,notwith-\nstandingtheinterventionofoneortwodearyears;sothelatterhavebeen\nagooddealaboveit,notwithstandingtheinterventionofoneortwocheap\nones, of 1759, for example. If the former have not been as much below\nthe general average as the latter have been above it, we ought probably\nto impute it to the bounty. The change has evidently been too sudden to\nbe ascribed to any change in the value of silver, which is always slow and\ngradual. Thesuddennessoftheeffectcanbeaccountedforonlybyacause\nwhichcanoperatesuddenly,theaccidentalvariationoftheseasons.\n513 [20] The money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, risen during\nthe course of the present century. This, however, seems to be the effect,\nnotsomuchofanydiminutioninthevalueofsilverintheEuropeanmar- G.ed.p219\nket, as of an increase in the demand for labour in Great Britain, arising\nfromthegreat,andalmostuniversalprosperityofthecountry.

Bothinthelastcenturyandinthepresentthe\nday-wagesofcommonlabouraretheresaidtohavebeenprettyuniformly\nabout the twentieth part of the average price of the septier of wheat, a\nmeasure which contains a little more than four Winchester bushels. In\nGreat Britain the real recompense of labour, it has already been shown,\nthe real quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are\ngiven to the labourer, has increased considerably during the course of the\npresent century. The rise in its money price seems to have been the ef-\nfect, not of any diminution of the value of silver in the general market of\nEurope,butofariseintherealpriceoflabourintheparticularmarketof\nGreatBritain,owingtothepeculiarlyhappycircumstancesofthecountry.\n514 [21] ForsometimeafterthefirstdiscoveryofAmerica,silverwouldcontinue\nto sell at its former, or not much below its former price. The profits of\n5[Smith]SeeTractsontheCornTrade;Tract3d.\n160", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmining would for some time be very great, and much above their natural\nrate. Those who imported that metal into Europe, however, would soon\nfind that the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at this\nhigh price. Silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a smaller\nquantity of goods. Its price would sink gradually lower and lower till it\nfell to its natural price, or to what was just sufficient to pay, according to\ntheir natural rates, the wages of the labour, the profits of the stock, and\ntherentoftheland,whichmustbepaidinordertobringitfromthemine\ntothemarket. InthegreaterpartofthesilverminesofPeru,thetaxofthe\nKing of Spain, amounting to a tenth of the gross produce, eats up, it has\nalreadybeenobserved,thewholerentoftheland. Thistaxwasoriginally\na half; it soon afterwards fell to a third, then to a fifth, and at last to a\ntenth, at which rate it still continues. In the greater part of the silver\nmines of Peru this, it seems, is all that remains after replacing the stock\nof the undertaker of the work, together with its ordinary profits; and it\nseems to be universally acknowledged that these profits, which were once\nvery high, are now as low as they can well be, consistently with carrying\nontheirworks.\n515 [22] ThetaxoftheKingofSpainwasreducedtoafifthpartoftheregistered\nsilver in 15046, one-and-forty years before 1545, the date of the discovery G.ed.p220\nof the mines of Potosi. In the course of ninety years, or before 1636, these\nmines,themostfertileinallAmerica,hadtimesufficienttoproducetheir\nfull effect, or to reduce the value of silver in the European market as low\nasitcouldwellfall,whileitcontinuedtopaythistaxtotheKingofSpain.\nNinety years is time sufficient to reduce any commodity, of which there is\nno monopoly, to its natural price, or to the lowest price at which, while it\npays a particular tax, it can continue to be sold for any considerable time\ntogether.\n516 [23] The price of silver in the European market might perhaps have fallen\nstill lower, and it might have become necessary either to reduce the tax\nupon it, not only to one tenth, as in 1736, but to one twentieth, in the\nsame manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater part\nof the American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increase of\nthe demand for silver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for the\nproduce of the silver mines of America, is probably the cause which has\npreventedthisfromhappening, andwhichhasnotonlykeptupthevalue\nofsilverintheEuropeanmarket,buthasperhapsevenraiseditsomewhat\nhigherthanitwasaboutthemiddleofthelastcentury.\n517 [24] Since the first discovery of America, the market for the produce of its\nsilvermineshasbeengrowinggraduallymoreandmoreextensive.\n518 [25] First, the market of Europe has become gradually more and more ex-\ntensive. Since the discovery of America, the greater part of Europe has\nbeen much improved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even\n6[Smith]Solorzano,vol.ii.[Solorzano-Pereira,DeIndiarumJure(Madrid,1977),ii.883.]\n161", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nSweden, Denmark, and Russia, have all advanced considerably both in\nagricultureandinmanufactures. Italyseemsnottohavegonebackwards.\nThe fall of Italy preceded the conquest of Peru. Since that time it seems\nrather to have recovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are sup-\nposed to have gone backwards. Portugal, however, is but a very small\npart of Europe, and the declension of Spain is not, perhaps, so great as\nis commonly imagined. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain\nwasaverypoorcountry, evenincomparisonwithFrance, whichhasbeen\nso much improved since that time. It was the well known remark of the\nEmperor Charles V, who had travelled so frequently through both coun-\ntries, that everything abounded in France, but that everything was want-\ninginSpain. Theincreasingproduceoftheagricultureandmanufactures\nofEuropemustnecessarilyhaverequiredagradualincreaseinthequant-\nityofsilvercointocirculateit;andtheincreasingnumberofwealthyindi-\nvidualsmusthaverequiredthelikeincreaseinthequantityoftheirplate\nandotherornamentsofsilver.\n519 [26] Secondly,Americaisitselfanewmarketfortheproduceofitsownsil- G.ed.p221\nver mines; and as its advances in agriculture, industry, and population\naremuchmorerapidthanthoseofthemostthrivingcountriesinEurope,\nits demand must increase much more rapidly. The English colonies are\naltogether a new market, which, partly for coin and partly for plate, re-\nquires a continually augmenting supply of silver through a great contin-\nent where there never was any demand before. The greater part, too, of\nthe Spanish and Portuguese colonies are altogether new markets. New\nGranada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils were, before discovered\nby the Europeans, inhabited by savage nations who had neither arts nor\nagriculture. A considerable degree of both has now been introduced into\nall of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though they cannot be considered as\naltogethernewmarkets,arecertainlymuchmoreextensiveonesthanthey\neverwerebefore. Afterallthewonderfultaleswhichhavebeenpublished\nconcerningthesplendidstateofthosecountriesinancienttimes,whoever\nreads, with any degree of sober judgment, the history of their first dis-\ncovery and conquest, will evidently discern that, in arts, agriculture, and\ncommerce, their inhabitants were much more ignorant than the Tartars\nof the Ukraine are at present. Even the Peruvians, the more civilised na-\ntion of the two, though they made use of gold and silver as ornaments,\nhad no coined money of any kind. Their whole commerce was carried on\nby barter, and there was accordingly scarce any division of labour among\nthem. Those who cultivated the ground were obliged to build their own\nhouses, to make their own household furniture, their own cloaths, shoes,\nand instruments of agriculture. The few artificers among them are said\nto have been all maintained by the sovereign, the nobles, and the priests,\nand were probably their servants or slaves. All the ancient arts of Mex-\nicoandPeruhaveneverfurnishedonesinglemanufacturetoEurope. The\nSpanish armies, though they scarce ever exceeded five hundred men, and\n162", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfrequently did not amount to half that number, found almost everywhere\ngreatdifficultyinprocuringsubsistence. Thefamineswhichtheyaresaid\nto have occasioned almost wherever they went, in countries, too, which\nat the same time are represented as very populous and well cultivated,\nsufficiently demonstrate that the story of this populousness and high cul-\ntivation is in a great measure fabulous. The Spanish colonies are under\na government in many respects less favourable to agriculture, improve-\nment, and population than that of the English colonies. They seem, how- G.ed.p222\never, to be advancing in all these much more rapidly than any country\nin Europe.

The difference in their accounts of the populousness\nofseveralotherprincipaltownsinChiliandPeruisnearlythesame; and\nas there seems to be no reason to doubt of the good information of either,\nit marks an increase which is scarce inferior to that of the English colon-\nies. America, therefore, is a new market for the produce of its own silver\nmines, of which the demand must increase much more rapidly than that\nofthemostthrivingcountryinEurope.\n520 [27] Thirdly,theEastIndiesisanothermarketfortheproduceofthesilver\nmines of America, and a market which, from the time of the first discov-\neryofthosemines,hasbeencontinuallytakingoffagreaterandagreater\nquantity of silver. Since that time, the direct trade between America and\nthe East Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco ships, has\nbeen continually augmenting, and the indirect intercourse by the way of\nEuropehasbeenaugmentinginastillgreaterproportion. Duringthesix-\nteenth century, the Portuguese were the only European nation who car-\nried on any regular trade to the East Indies. In the last years of that\ncentury the Dutch begun to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a few\nyearsexpelledthemfromtheirprincipalsettlementsinIndia. Duringthe\ngreaterpartofthelastcenturythosetwonationsdividedthemostconsid-\nerable part of the East India trade between them; the trade of the Dutch\ncontinually augmenting in a still greater proportion than that of the Por- G.ed.p223\ntuguese declined. The English and French carried on some trade with\nIndia in the last century, but it has been greatly augmented in the course\nofthepresent. TheEastIndiatradeoftheSwedesandDanesbeganinthe\ncourse of the present century. Even the Muscovites now trade regularly\nwith China by a sort of caravans which go overland through Siberia and\nTartary to Pekin. The East India trade of all these nations, if we except\nthatoftheFrench,whichthelastwarhadwellnighannihilated,hadbeen\nalmostcontinuallyaugmenting. TheincreasingconsumptionofEastIndia\ngoods in Europe is, it seems, so great as to afford a gradual increase of\n163", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nemployment to them all. Tea, for example, was a drug very little used in\nEurope before the middle of the last century. At present the value of the\ntea annually imported by the English East India Company, for the use of\ntheir own countrymen, amounts to more than a million and a half a year;\nandeventhisisnotenough; agreatdealmorebeingconstantlysmuggled\ninto the country from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburgh in Sweden,\nand from the coast of France too, as long as the French East India Com-\npanywasinprosperity. TheconsumptionoftheporcelainofChina, ofthe\nspiceriesoftheMoluccas,ofthepiecegoodsofBengal,andofinnumerable\notherarticles,hasincreasedverynearlyinalikeproportion. Thetonnage\naccordinglyofalltheEuropeanshippingemployedintheEastIndiatrade,\nat any one time during the last century, was not, perhaps, much greater\nthan that of the English East India Company before the late reduction of\ntheirshipping.\n521 [28] But in the East Indies, particularly in China and Indostan, the value\nof the precious metals, when the Europeans first began to trade to those\ncountries, was much higher than in Europe; and it still continues to be\nso. In rice countries, which generally yield two, sometimes three crops in\nthe year, each of them more plentiful than any common crop of corn, the\nabundanceoffoodmustbemuchgreaterthaninanycorncountryofequal\nextent. Suchcountriesareaccordinglymuchmorepopulous. Inthem,too,\nthe rich, having a greater superabundance of food to dispose of beyond\nwhattheythemselvescanconsume,havethemeansofpurchasingamuch\ngreater quantity of the labour of other people. The retinue of a grandee\nin China or Indostan accordingly is, by all accounts, much more numer-\nous and splendid than that of the richest subjects in Europe. The same\nsuperabundance of food, of which they have the disposal, enables them to\ngive a greater quantity of it for all those singular and rare productions\nwhich nature furnishes but in very small quantities; such as the precious G.ed.p224\nmetalsandthepreciousstones, thegreatobjectsofthecompetitionofthe\nrich. Though the mines, therefore, which supplied the Indian market had\nbeen as abundant as those which supplied the European, such commodit-\nies would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in India than\ninEurope. ButthemineswhichsuppliedtheIndianmarketwiththepre-\nciousmetalsseemtohavebeenagooddeallessabundant,andthosewhich\nsupplied it with the precious stones a good deal more so, than the mines\nwhich supplied the European. The precious metals, therefore, would nat-\nurally exchange in India for somewhat a greater quantity of the precious\nstones,andforamuchgreaterquantityoffoodthaninEurope. Themoney\nprice of diamonds, the greatest of all superfluities, would be somewhat\nlower,andthatoffood,thefirstofallnecessaries,agreatdeallowerinthe\nonecountrythanintheother. Buttherealpriceoflabour,therealquant-\nity of the necessaries of life which is given to the labourer, it has already\nbeenobserved,islowerbothinChinaandIndostan,thetwogreatmarkets\nof India, than it is through the greater part of Europe. The wages of the\n164", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlabourerwilltherepurchaseasmallerquantityoffood; andasthemoney\npriceoffoodismuchlowerinIndiathaninEurope,themoneypriceofla-\nbouristhereloweruponadoubleaccount;uponaccountbothofthesmall\nquantity of food which it will purchase, and of the low price of that food.\nBut in countries of equal art and industry, the money price of the greater\npartofmanufactureswillbeinproportiontothemoneypriceoflabour;and\nin manufacturing art and industry, China and Indostan, though inferior,\nseemnottobemuchinferiortoanypartofEurope. Themoneypriceofthe\ngreater part of manufactures, therefore, will naturally be much lower in\nthose great empires than it is anywhere in Europe. Through the greater\npartofEurope,too,theexpenseofland-carriageincreasesverymuchboth\nthe real and nominal price of most manufactures. It costs more labour,\nandthereforemoremoney,tobringfirstthematerials,andafterwardsthe\ncomplete manufacture to market. In China and Indostan the extent and\nvariety of inland navigation save the greater part of this labour, and con-\nsequently of this money, and thereby reduce still lower both the real and\nthenominalpriceofthegreaterpartoftheirmanufactures. Uponallthose\naccounts the precious metals axe a commodity which it always has been,\nandstillcontinuestobe,extremelyadvantageoustocarryfromEuropeto\nIndia. There is scarce any commodity which brings a better price there;\nor which, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities which\nitcostsinEurope, willpurchaseorcommandagreaterquantityoflabour\nand commodities in India. It is more advantageous, too, to carry silver\nthitherthangold;becauseinChina,andthegreaterpartoftheothermar- G.ed.p225\nketsofIndia,theproportionbetweenfinesilverandfinegoldisbutasten,\noratmostastwelve, toone; whereasinEuropeitisasfourteenorfifteen\ntoone. InChina,andthegreaterpartoftheothermarketsofIndia,ten,or\nat most twelve, ounces of silver will purchase an ounce of gold; in Europe\nitrequiresfromfourteentofifteenounces. Inthecargoes,therefore,ofthe\ngreater part of European ships which sail to India, silver has generally\nbeen one of the most valuable articles. It is the most valuable article in\nthe Acapulco ships which sail to Manilla. The silver of the new continent\nseemsinthismannertobeoneoftheprincipalcommoditiesbywhichthe\ncommerce between the two extremities of the old one is carried on, and it\nisbymeansofit,inagreatmeasure,thatthosedistantpartsoftheworld\nareconnectedwithoneanother.\n522 [29] In order to supply so very widely extended a market, the quantity of\nsilverannuallybroughtfromtheminesmustnotonlybesufficienttosup-\nport that continual increase both of coin and of plate which is required in\nallthrivingcountries;buttorepairthatcontinualwasteandconsumption\nofsilverwhichtakesplaceinallcountrieswherethatmetalisused.\n523 [30] The continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing,\nand in plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very sensible, and in com-\nmoditiesofwhichtheuseissoverywidelyextended,wouldalonerequirea\nverygreatannualsupply. Theconsumptionofthosemetalsinsomepartic-\n165", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon the whole\nthan this gradual consumption, is, however, much more sensible, as it is\nmuchmorerapid. InthemanufacturesofBirminghamalonethequantity\nof gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating, and thereby\ndisqualified from ever afterwards appearing in the shape of those metals,\nis said to amount to more than fifty thousand pounds sterling. We may\nfromthenceformsomenotionhowgreatmustbetheannualconsumption G.ed.p226\nin all the different parts of the world either in manufactures of the same\nkind with those of Birmingham, or in laces, embroideries, gold and silver\nstuffs, the gilding of books, furniture, etc. A considerable quantity, too,\nmust be annually lost in transporting those metals from one place to an-\nother both by sea and by land. In the greater part of the governments of\nAsia, besides, the almost universal custom of concealing treasures in the\nbowels of the earth, of which the knowledge frequently dies with the per-\nson who makes the concealment, must occasion the loss of a still greater\nquantity.\n524 [31] ThequantityofgoldandsilverimportedatbothCadizandLisbon(in-\ncludingnotonlywhatcomesunderregister, butwhatmaybesupposedto\nbesmuggled)amounts,accordingtothebestaccounts,toaboutsixmillions\nsterlingayear.\n525 [32] According to Mr. Meggens7 the annual importation of the precious\nmetalsintoSpain,atanaverageofsixyears;viz. from1748to1753,both\ninclusive;andintoPortugal,atanaverageofsevenyears,viz.,from1747to\n1753,bothinclusive,amountedinsilverto1,101,107poundsweight;andin\ngold to 49,940 pounds weight. The silver, at sixty-two shillings the pound\nTroy, amounts to 3,413,431l.10s. sterling. The gold, at forty-four guineas\nand a half the pound Troy, amounts to 2,333,446l.14s. sterling. Both to-\ngether amount to 5,746,878l.4s. sterling. The account of what was impor-\nted under register he assures us is exact. He gives us the detail of the\nparticular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and of the\nparticularquantityofeachmetal,which,accordingtotheregister,eachof\nthemafforded.

He gives the detail, too, of the\nparticular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and of the G.ed.p227\nparticular quantities of each metal which, according to the register, each\nofthemafforded. Heinformsus,too,thatifweweretojudgeofthequant-\nity of gold annually imported from the Brazils into Lisbon by the amount\nof the tax paid to the King of Portugal, which it seems is one-fifth of the\nstandard metal, we might value it at eighteen millions of cruzadoes, or\nforty-five millions of French livres, equal to about two millions sterling.\nOn account of what may have been smuggled, however, we may safely,\nhe says, add to the sum an eighth more, or 250,000l. sterling, so that the\nwholewillamountto2,250,000l.sterling. Accordingtothisaccount,there-\nfore, thewholeannualimportationofthepreciousmetalsintobothSpain\nandPortugalamountstoabout6,075,000l.sterling.\n527 [34] Several other very well authenticated, though manuscript, accounts, I\nhavebeenassured,agreeinmakingthiswholeannualimportationamount\natanaveragetoaboutsixmillionssterling;sometimesalittlemore,some-\ntimesalittleless.\n528 [35] The annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Lisbon,\nindeed, isnotequaltothewholeannualproduceoftheminesofAmerica.\nSomepartissentannuallybytheAcapulcoshipstoManilla;somepartis\nemployedinthecontrabandtradewhichtheSpanishcoloniescarryonwith\nthose of other European nations; and some part, no doubt remains in the\ncountry. TheminesofAmerica,besides,arebynomeanstheonlygoldand\nsilver mines in the world. They are, however, by far the most abundant.\nThe produce of all the other mines which are known is insignificant, it is\nacknowledged,incomparisonwiththeirs;andthefargreaterpartoftheir\nproduce,itislikewiseacknowledged,isannuallyimportedintoCadizand\nLisbon. But the consumption of Birmingham alone, at the rate of fifty\nthousandpoundsayear,isequaltothehundred-and-twentiethpartofthis\nannual importation at the rate of six millions a year. The whole annual\nconsumption of gold and silver, therefore, in all the different countries of\ntheworldwherethosemetalsareused,mayperhapsbenearlyequaltothe G.ed.p228\nwhole annual produce. The remainder may be no more than sufficient to\nsupply the increasing demand of all thriving countries. It may even have\nfallen so far short of time demand as somewhat to raise the price of those\nmetalsintheEuropeanmarket.\n529 [36] The quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to the\nmarket is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and silver. We\ndo not, however, upon this account, imagine that those coarse metals are\nlikelytomultiplybeyondthedemand,ortobecomegraduallycheaperand\ncheaper.

The great quantity of silver sent\nannually to the East Indies reduces, he supposes, the quantities of those\nmetals which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or fif-\nteen, the proportion of their values. The proportion between their values,\nhe seems to think, must necessarily be the same as that between their\nquantities, and would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not for\nthisgreaterexportationofsilver.\n534 [4] Buttheordinaryproportionbetweentherespectivevaluesoftwocom-\nmoditiesisnotnecessarilythesameasthatbetweenthequantitiesofthem\nwhich are commonly in the market.

The whole quantity of a\ncheap commodity brought to market is commonly not only greater, but of\ngreater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one. The whole quantity\nof bread annually brought to market is not only greater, but of greater\nvalue than the whole quantity of butcher\u2019s meat; the whole quantity of\nbutcher\u2019smeat,thanthewholequantityofpoultry;andthewholequantity\nofwildfowl.

Whenwecomparetheprecious\nmetals with oneanother, silver is a cheapand gold a dear commodity. We\nought naturally to expect, therefore, that there should always be in the\nmarket not only a greater quantity, but a greater value of silver than of\ngold. Let any man who has a little of both compare his own silver with\nhis gold plate, and he will probably find that, not only the quantity, but\nthe value of the former greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people,\nbesides, have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate, which, even\nwith those who have it, is generally confined to watchcases, snuff-boxes,\nandsuchliketrinkets,ofwhichthewholeamountisseldomofgreatvalue.\n169", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nIntheBritishcoin,indeed,thevalueofthegoldpreponderatesgreatly,but\nitisnotsointhatofallcountries.

In France, the largest sums are commonly paid in\nthatmetal,anditistheredifficulttogetmoregoldthanwhatisnecessary\nto carry about in your pocket.

Itistheprice\nwhich affords nothing to the landlord, of which rent makes not any com-\nponent part, but which resolves itself altogether into wages and profit.\nBut, in the present state of the Spanish market, gold is certainly some-\nwhat nearer to this lowest price than silver. The tax of the King of Spain\nupongoldisonlyone-twentiethpartofthestandardmetal,orfivepercent;\nwhereas his tax upon silver amounts to one-tenth part of it, or to ten per\ncent. In these taxes too, it has already been observed, consists the whole\nrent of the greater part of the gold and silver mines of Spanish America;\nand that upon gold is still worse paid than that upon silver. The profits\nof the undertakers of gold mines too, as they more rarely make a fortune,\nmust, in general, be still more moderate than those of the undertakers of\nsilver mines. The price of Spanish gold, therefore, as it affords both less\nrent and less profit, must, in the Spanish market, be somewhat nearer to\nthe lowest price for which it is possible to bring it thither than the price\nof Spanish silver. When all expenses are computed, the whole quantity of\nthe one metal, it would seem, cannot, in the Spanish market, be disposed\nof so advantageously as the whole quantity of the other. The tax, indeed,\nof the King of Portugal upon the gold of the Brazils is the same with the\nancienttaxoftheKingofSpainuponthesilverofMexicoandPeru;orone-\nfifthpartofthestandardmetal.

The increase of the expense\nmusteither,first,becompensatedaltogetherbyaproportionableincrease\nin the price of the metal; or, secondly, it must be compensated altogether\nby a proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver; or, thirdly, it must\nbe compensated partly by the one, and partly by the other of those two\nexpedients. This third event is very possible. As gold rose in its price in\nproportion to silver, notwithstanding a great diminution of the tax upon\ngold, so silver might rise in its price in proportion to labour and commod-\nities,notwithstandinganequaldiminutionofthetaxuponsilver.\n540 [10] Such successive reductions of the tax, however, though they may not\npreventaltogether,mustcertainlyretard,moreorless,theriseofthevalue G.ed.p233\nofsilverintheEuropeanmarket. Inconsequenceofsuchreductionsmany\nmines may be wrought which could not be wrought before, because they\ncould not afford to pay the old tax; and the quantity of silver annually\nbrought to market must always be somewhat greater, and, therefore, the\nvalue of any given quantity somewhat less, than it otherwise would have\nbeen. In consequence of the reduction in 1736, the value of silver in the\nEuropeanmarket,thoughitmaynotatthisdaybelowerthanbeforethat\nreduction,is,probably,atleasttenpercentlowerthanitwouldhavebeen\nhadtheCourtofSpaincontinuedtoexacttheoldtax.\n541 [11] That, notwithstanding this reduction, the value of silver has, during\nthecourseofthepresentcentury,beguntorisesomewhatintheEuropean\nmarket, the facts and arguments which have been alleged above dispose\nme to believe, or more properly to suspect and conjecture; for the best\nopinion which I can form upon this subject scarce, perhaps, deserves the\nnameofbelief. Therise,indeed,supposingtherehasbeenany,hashitherto\n171", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbeensoverysmallthatafterallthathasbeensaiditmay,perhaps,appear\nto many people uncertain, not only whether this event has actually taken\nplace;butwhetherthecontrarymaynothavetakenplace,orwhetherthe\nvalueofthesilvermaynotstillcontinuetofallintheEuropeanmarket.\n542 [12] It must be observed, however, that whatever may be the supposed an-\nnualimportationofgoldandsilver,theremustbeacertainperiodatwhich\nthe annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that annual im-\nportation. Their consumption must increase as their mass increases, or\nrather in a much greater proportion. As their mass increases, their value\ndiminishes. Theyaremoreusedandlesscaredfor,andtheirconsumption\nconsequently increases in a greater proportion than their mass. After a\ncertain period, therefore, the annual consumption of those metals must,\nin this manner, become equal to their annual importation, provided that\nimportation is not continually increasing; which, in the present times, is\nnotsupposedtobethecase.\n543 [13] If, when the annual consumption has become equal to the annual im-\nportation, the annual importation should gradually diminish, the annual\nconsumptionmay,forsometime,exceedtheannualimportation. Themass\nof those metals may gradually and insensibly diminish, and their value\ngradually and insensibly rise, till the annual importation become again\nstationary, the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly accom-\nmodateitselftowhatthatannualimportationcanmaintain.\nGroundsoftheSuspicionthattheValueofSilver G.ed.p234\nstillcontinuestodecrease\n544 [1] The increase of the wealth of Europe, and the popular notion that, as the\nquantity of the precious metals naturally increases with the increase of\nwealthsotheirvaluediminishesastheirquantityincreases,may,perhaps,\ndisposemanypeopletobelievethattheirvaluestillcontinuestofallinthe\nEuropeanmarket;andthestillgraduallyincreasingpriceofmanypartsof\ntherudeproduceoflandmayconfirmthemstillfurtherinthisopinion.\n545 [2] Thatthatincreaseinthequantityofthepreciousmetals,whicharises\nin any country from the increase of wealth, has no tendency to diminish\ntheirvalue,Ihaveendeavouredtoshowalready.

Though such commodities, therefore, come\nto exchange for a greater quantity of silver than before, it will not from\nthence follow that silver has become really cheaper, or will purchase less\nlabour than before, but that such commodities have become really dearer,\norwillpurchasemorelabourthanbefore.

The rise\nof their nominal price is the effect, not of any degradation of the value of\nsilver,butoftheriseintheirrealprice.\nDifferentEffectsoftheProgressofImprovement\nupontherealpriceofthreedifferentSortsofrude\nProduce\n547 [1] These different sorts of rude produce may be divided into three classes.\nThe first comprehends those which it is scarce in the power of human\nindustry to multiply at all. The second, those which it can multiply in\nproportiontothedemand. Thethird,thoseinwhichtheefficacyofindustry G.ed.p235\niseitherlimitedoruncertain.

It consists in those things which nature produces only\nin certain quantities, and which, being of a very perishable nature, it is\nimpossible to accumulate together the produce of many different seasons.\nSuch are the greater part of rare and singular birds and fishes, many dif-\nferent sorts of game, almost all wild-fowl, all birds of passage in partic-\nular, as well as many other things. When wealth and the luxury which\naccompanies it increase, the demand for these is likely to increase with\nthem, and no effort of human industry may be able to increase the sup-\nply much beyond what it was before this increase of the demand. The\nquantity of such commodities, therefore, remaining the same, or nearly\nthe same, while the competition to purchase them is continually increas-\n173", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ning, their price may rise to any degree of extravagance, and seems not to\nbe limited by any certain boundary. If woodcocks should become so fash-\nionable as to sell for twenty guineas apiece, no effort of human industry\ncould increase the number of those brought to market much beyond what\nit is at present. The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of their\ngreatest grandeur, for rare birds and fishes, may in this manner easily be\naccounted for. These prices were not the effects of the low value of silver\ninthosetimes,butofthehighvalueofsuchraritiesandcuriositiesashu-\nman industry could not multiply at pleasure. The real value of silver was\nhigher at Rome, for some time before and after the fall of the republic,\nthan it is through the greater part of Europe at present. Three sestertii,\nequaltoaboutsixpencesterling,wasthepricewhichtherepublicpaidfor\nthe modius or peck of the tithe wheat of Sicily. This price, however, was\nprobably below the average market price, the obligation to deliver their\nwheat at this rate being considered as a tax upon the Sicilian farmers.\nWhen the Romans, therefore, had occasion to order more corn than the G.ed.p236\ntitheofwheatamountedto,theywereboundbycapitulationtopayforthe\nsurplus at the rate of four sestertii, or eightpence sterling, the peck; and\nthishadprobablybeenreckonedthemoderateandreasonable,thatis,the\nordinary or average contract price of those times; it is equal to about one-\nand-twenty shillings the quarter. Eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter\nwas,beforethelateyearsofscarcity,theordinarycontractpriceofEnglish\nwheat, which in quality is inferior to the Sicilian, and generally sells for\na lower price in the European market. The value of silver, therefore, in\nthoseancienttimes,musthavebeentoitsvalueinthepresentasthreeto\nfour inversely; that is, three ounces of silver would then have purchased\nthe same quantity of labour and commodities which four ounces will do\nat present. When we read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius9 bought a white\nnightingale,asapresentfortheEmpressAgrippina,atapriceofsixthou-\nsand sestertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our present money; and that\nAsinius Celer10 purchased a surmullet at the price of eight thousand ses-\ntertii, equal to about sixty-six pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence of\nour present money, the extravagance of those prices, how much soever it\nmay surprise us, is apt, notwithstanding, to appear to us about one-third\nless than it really was. Their real price, the quantity of labour and sub-\nsistence which was given away for them, was about one-third more than\ntheirnominalpriceisapttoexpresstousinthepresenttimes. Seiusgave\nfor the nightingale the command of a quantity of labour and subsistence\nequal to what 66l.13s.4d. would purchase in the present times; and Asin-\niusCelergaveforthesurmulletthecommandofaquantityequaltowhat\n88l.17s91d. would purchase. What occasioned the extravagance of those\n3\nhigh prices was, not so much the abundance of silver as the abundance\noflabourandsubsistenceofwhichthoseRomanshadthedisposalbeyond\n9[Smith]Lib.x.c.29.\n10[Smith]Lib.ix.c.17.\n174", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwhatwasnecessaryfortheirownuse.

It consists in those useful plants and animals which, in un-\ncultivated countries, nature produces with such profuse abundance that\ntheyareoflittleornovalue,andwhich,ascultivationadvancesarethere-\nfore forced to give place to some more profitable produce. During a long\nperiodintheprogressofimprovement,thequantityoftheseiscontinually\ndiminishing, while at the same time the demand for them is continually\nincreasing. Their real value, therefore, the real quantity of labour which\nthey will purchase or command, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high\nas to render them as profitable a produce as anything else which human\nindustry can raise upon the most fertile and best cultivated land. When\nit has got so high it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more\nindustrywouldsoonbeemployedtoincreasetheirquantity.\n550 [2] When the price of cattle, for example, rises so high that it is as profit-\nabletocultivatelandinordertoraisefoodforthemasinordertoraisefood\nfor man, it cannot well go higher.

There are, perhaps, some parts of Europe in\nwhich the price of cattle has not yet got to this height. It had not got to\nthisheightinanypartofScotlandbeforetheunion.

Of all the different substances, however, which\ncomposethissecondsortofrudeproduce, cattleis, perhaps, thatofwhich\ntheprice,intheprogressofimprovement,firstrisestothisheight.\n551 [3] Till the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it seems scarce\npossiblethatthegreaterpart,evenofthoselandswhicharecapableofthe\nhighest cultivation, can be completely cultivated.

A portion of this waste\nland,however,afterhavingbeenpasturedinthiswretchedmannerforsix\nor seven years together, may be ploughed up, when it will yield, perhaps,\na poor crop or two of bad oats, or of some other coarse grain, and then,\nbeing entirely exhausted, it must be rested and pastured again as before\nandanotherportionplougheduptobeinthesamemannerexhaustedand\nrestedagaininitsturn.

But in countries ill cultivated, and\ntherefore but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are thus raised without\nexpense, are often fully sufficient to supply the whole demand. In this\nstate of things, therefore, they are often as cheap as butcher\u2019s meat, or\nany other sort of animal food. But the whole quantity of poultry, which\nthe farmin this mannerproduces without expense, must always bemuch\nsmaller than the whole quantity of butcher\u2019s meat which is reared upon\nit; and in times of wealth and luxury what is rare, with only nearly equal\nmerit, is always preferred to what is common. As wealth and luxury in-\ncrease,therefore,inconsequenceofimprovementandcultivation,theprice\nof poultry gradually rises above that of butcher\u2019s meat, till at last it gets\nso high that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the sake of feed-\ning them. When it has got to this height it cannot well go higher. If it\ndid,morelandwouldsoonbeturnedtothispurpose. Inseveralprovinces\nof France, the feeding of poultry is considered as a very important article\nin rural economy, and sufficiently profitable to encourage the farmer to\nraise a considerable quantity of Indian corn and buck-wheat for this pur-\npose. A middling farmer will there sometimes have four hundred fowls\nin his yard. The feeding of poultry seems scarce yet to be generally con-\nsideredasamatterofsomuchimportanceinEngland. Theyarecertainly,\nhowever, dearer in England than in France, as England receives consid-\nerable supplies from France. In the progress of improvement, the period\natwhicheveryparticularsortofanimalfoodisdearestmustnaturallybe\nthat which immediately precedes the general practice of cultivating land\nfor the sake of raising it. For some time before this practice becomes gen-\neral,thescarcitymustnecessarilyraisetheprice.

The plenty not only obliges him to\nsell cheaper, but in consequence of these improvements he can afford to\n179", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nsell cheaper; for if he could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long\ncontinuance. Ithasbeenprobablyinthismannerthattheintroductionof\nclover, turnips, carrots, cabbage, etc., has contributed to sink the common\npriceofbutcher\u2019smeatintheLondonmarketsomewhatbelowwhatitwas\naboutthebeginningofthelastcentury.\n557 [9] The hog, that finds his food among ordure and greedily devours many\nthings rejected by every other useful animal, is, like poultry, originally\nkeptasasave-all. Aslongasthenumberofsuchanimals,whichcanthus\nbe reared at little or no expense, is fully sufficient to supply the demand,\nthis sort of butcher\u2019s meat comes to market at a much lower price than\nany other. But when the demand rises beyond what this quantity can\nsupply, when it becomes necessary to raise food on purpose for feeding\nandfatteninghogs,inthesamemannerasforfeedingandfatteningother\ncattle, the price necessarily rises, and becomes proportionably higher or\nlower than that of other butcher\u2019s meat, according as the nature of the\ncountry, and the state of its agriculture, happen to render the feeding of\nhogsmoreorlessexpensivethanthatofothercattle. InFrance,according\ntoMr.Buffon,thepriceofporkisnearlyequaltothatofbeef.

Buttheextentoftheirrespective\nmarketsiscommonlyextremelydifferent.\n565 [4] The market for butcher\u2019s meat is almost everywhere confined to the\ncountry which produces it. Ireland, and some part of British America in-\ndeed, carry on a considerable trade in salt provisions; but they are, I be-\nlieve, the only countries in the commercial world which do so, or which\nexporttoothercountriesanyconsiderablepartoftheirbutcher\u2019smeat.\n566 [5] Themarketforwoolandrawhides,onthecontrary,isintherudebegin-\nningsofimprovementveryseldomconfinedtothecountrywhichproduces\nthem.

The\nmarketforthecarcase,beingintherudestateofsocietyconfinedalwaysto\nthecountrywhichproducesit,mustnecessarilybeextendedinproportion\n183", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto the improvement and population of that country. But the market for\nthe wool and the hides even of a barbarous country often extending to\nthe whole commercial world, it can very seldom be enlarged in the same\nproportion. The state of the whole commercial world can seldom be much\naffected by the improvement of any particular country; and the market\nfor such commodities may remain the same or very nearly the same after\nsuch improvements as before. It should, however, in the natural course\nof things rather upon the whole be somewhat extended in consequence of\nthem. Ifthemanufactures,especially,ofwhichthosecommoditiesarethe\nmaterials should ever come to flourish in the country, the market, though\nit might not be much enlarged, would at least be brought much nearer to\nthe place of growth than before; and the price of those materials might at\nleast be increased by what had usually been the expense of transporting\nthem to distant countries. Though it might not rise therefore in the same G.ed.p248\nproportion as that of butcher\u2019s meat, it ought naturally to rise somewhat,\nanditoughtcertainlynottofall.\n569 [8] InEngland,however,notwithstandingtheflourishingstateofitswool-\nlen manufacture, the price of English wool has fallen very considerably\nsince the time of Edward III. There are many authentic records which\ndemonstrate that during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of\nthe fourteenth century, or about 1339) what was reckoned the moderate\nand reasonable price of the tod, or twenty-eight pounds of English wool,\nwas not less than ten shillings of the money of those times12, containing\nat the rate of twentypence the ounce, six ounces of silver Tower weight,\nequaltoaboutthirtyshillingsofourpresentmoney. Inthepresenttimes,\none-and-twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a good price for very\ngood English wool. The money-price of wool, therefore, in the time of Ed-\nwardIII,wastoitsmoney-priceinthepresenttimesastentoseven. The\nsuperiorityofitsrealpricewasstillgreater.

Inthoseancienttimesatod\nof wool would have purchased twice the quantity of subsistence which it\nwillpurchaseatpresent;andconsequentlytwicethequantityoflabour,if\ntherealrecompenseoflabourhadbeenthesameinbothperiods.\n570 [9] Thisdegradationbothintherealandnominalvalueofwoolcouldnever\nhave happened in consequence of the natural course of things. It has ac-\ncordinglybeentheeffectofviolenceandartifice: first,oftheabsolutepro-\nhibition of exporting wool from England; secondly, of the permission of\nimporting it from Spain duty free; thirdly, of the prohibition of exporting\nitfromIrelandtoanyothercountrybutEngland. Inconsequenceofthese G.ed.p249\n12[Smith]SeeSmith\u2019sMemoirsofWool,vol.i.c.5,6,and7;also,vol.ii.c.176.\n184", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nregulationsthemarketforEnglishwool,insteadofbeingsomewhatexten-\nded in consequence of the improvement of England, has been confined to\nthe home market, where the wool of several other countries is allowed to\ncomeintocompetitionwithit,andwherethatofIrelandisforcedintocom-\npetition with it.

Wool was commonly paid as a sub-\nsidy to the king, and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains, at least in\nsomedegree,whatwasitsordinaryprice. Butthisseemsnottohavebeen\nthe case with raw hides. Fleetwood, however, from an account in 1425,\nbetweenthepriorofBurcesterOxfordandoneofhiscanons,givesustheir\nprice, at least as it was stated upon that particular occasion, viz., five ox\nhidesattwelveshillings;fivecowhidesatsevenshillingsandthreepence;\nthirty-six sheep skins of two years old at nine shillings; sixteen calves\nskinsattwoshillings. In1425, twelveshillingscontainedaboutthesame\nquantityofsilverasfour-and-twentyshillingsofourpresentmoney. Anox\nhide, therefore, was in this account valued at the same quantity of silver\nas 4s.4ths of our present money. Its nominal price was a good deal lower\n5\nthanatpresent. Butattherateofsixshillingsandeightpencethequarter,\ntwelveshillingswouldinthosetimeshavepurchasedfourteenbushelsand\nfour-fifths of a bushel of wheat, which, at three and sixpence the bushel,\nwould in the present times cost 51s.4d. An ox hide, therefore, would in\nthosetimes havepurchasedas muchcorn asten shillings andthreepence G.ed.p250\nwould purchase at present. Its real value was equal to ten shillings and\nthreepence of our present money. In those ancient times, when the cattle\nwerehalfstarvedduringthegreaterpartofthewinter,wecannotsuppose\nthat they were of a very large size. An ox hide which weighs four stone\nof sixteen pounds avoirdupois is not in the present times reckoned a bad\none;andinthoseancienttimeswouldprobablyhavebeenreckonedavery\ngood one. But at half-a-crown the stone, which at this moment (February\n1773) I understand to be the common price, such a hide would at present\ncostonlytenshillings. Thoughitsnominalprice,therefore,ishigherinthe\npresent than it was in those ancient times, its real price, the real quant-\nityofsubsistencewhichitwillpurchaseorcommand, israthersomewhat\nlower. The price of cow hides, as stated in the above account, is nearly in\nthe common proportion to that of ox hides. That of sheep skins is a good\ndeal above it. They had probably been sold with the wool. That of calves\nskins, on the contrary, is greatly below it. In countries where the price of\ncattle is very low, the calves, which are not intended to be reared in order\nto keep up the stock, are generally killed very young; as was the case in\n185", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nScotland twenty or thirty years ago. It saves the milk, which their price\nwouldnotpayfor. Theirskins,therefore,arecommonlygoodforlittle.\n572 [11] Thepriceofrawhidesisagooddealloweratpresentthanitwasafew\nyears ago, owing probably to the taking off the duty upon sealskins, and\nto the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides from Ire-\nlandandfromtheplantationsdutyfree,whichwasdonein1769. Takethe\nwhole of the present century at an average, their real price has probably\nbeen somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times.

Ifitisnot,theywillsoonceasetofeedthem. Whateverpart\nof this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid\nby the carcase. The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid\nfortheother.

Thewholepriceofcattlewouldfall, G.ed.p252\nand along with it both the rent and the profit of all those lands of which\ncattle was the principal produce, that is, of the greater part of the lands\nofthecountry. Theperpetualprohibitionoftheexportationofwool,which\nis commonly, but very falsely, ascribed to Edward III, would, in the then\ncircumstances of the country, have been the most destructive regulation\nwhichcouldwellhavebeenthoughtof. Itwouldnotonlyhavereducedthe\nactual value of the greater part of the lands of the kingdom, but by redu-\ncing the price of the most important species of small cattle it would have\nretardedverymuchitssubsequentimprovement.\n574 [13] The wool of Scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence\noftheunionwithEngland,bywhichitwasexcludedfromthegreatmarket\nof Europe, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain.

Thisnotionis\nconnectedwiththesystemofpoliticaleconomywhichrepresentsnational\nwealthasconsistingintheabundance,andnationalpovertyinthescarcity\nofgoldandsilver; asystemwhichIshallendeavourtoexplainandexam-\nine at great length in the fourth book of this inquiry. I shall only observe\natpresentthatthehighvalueofthepreciousmetalscanbenoproofofthe\npoverty or barbarism of any particular country at the time when it took\nplace. It is a proof only of the barrenness of the mines which happened\nat that time to supply the commercial world. A poor country, as it cannot\naffordtobuymore,soitcanaslittleaffordtopaydearerforgoldandsilver\nthanarichone;andthevalueofthosemetals,therefore,isnotlikelytobe\nhigher in the former than in the latter. In China, a country much richer\nthan any part of Europe, the value of the precious metals is much higher\nthaninanypartofEurope. AsthewealthofEurope,indeed,hasincreased\ngreatlysincethediscoveryoftheminesofAmerica,sothevalueofgoldand\nsilver has gradually diminished. This diminution of their value, however,\nhasnotbeenowingtotheincreaseoftherealwealthofEurope,ofthean-\nnualproduceofitslandandlabour,buttotheaccidentaldiscoveryofmore\nabundant mines than any that were known before.

Theirquantity,therefore,musthaveincreasedthereasin\nother places, and nearly in the same proportion to the annual produce of\nitslandandlabour. Thisincreaseofthequantityofthosemetals,however,\nhas not, it seems, increased that annual produce, has neither improved\nthe manufactures and agriculture of the country, nor mended the circum-\nstancesofitsinhabitants. SpainandPortugal,thecountrieswhichpossess\nthe mines, are, after Poland, perhaps, the two most beggarly countries in\nEurope. Thevalueofthepreciousmetals,however,mustbelowerinSpain\nand Portugal than in any other part of Europe; as they come from those\ncountries to all other parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and\nan insurance, but with the expense of smuggling, their exportation be-\ning either prohibited, or subjected to a duty. In proportion to the annual\nproduce of the land and labour, therefore, their quantity must be greater\ninthosecountriesthaninanyotherpartofEurope. Thosecountries,how-\never,arepoorerthanthegreaterpartofEurope. Thoughthefeudalsystem\nhas been abolished in Spain and Portugal, it has not been succeeded by a\nmuchbetter.\n584 [2] As the low value of gold and silver, therefore, is no proof of the wealth\nandflourishingstateofthecountrywhereittakesplace;soneitheristheir\nhighvalue,orthelowmoneypriceeitherofgoodsingeneral,orofcornin\nparticular,anyproofofitspovertyandbarbarism.\n585 [3] But though the low money price either of goods in general, or of corn\nin particular, be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times, the\nlow money price of some particular sorts of goods, such as cattle, poultry,\ngame of all kinds, etc., in proportion to that of corn, is a most decisive G.ed.p257\none. It clearly demonstrates, first, their great abundance in proportion\nto that of corn, and consequently the great extent of the land which they\noccupiedinproportiontowhatwasoccupiedbycorn;and,secondly,thelow\nvalueofthislandinproportiontothatofcornland, andconsequentlythe\nuncultivated and unimproved state of the far greater part of the lands of\nthe country. It clearly demonstrates that the stock and population of the\ncountrydidnotbearthesameproportiontotheextentofitsterritorywhich\ntheycommonlydoincivilisedcountries,andthatsocietywasatthattime,\nand in that country, but in its infancy. From the high or low money price\neither of goods in general, or of corn in particular, we can infer only that\nthe mines which at that time happened to supply the commercial world\nwith gold and silver were fertile or barren, not that the country was rich\nor poor. But from the high or low money price of some sorts of goods in\nproportiontothatofothers,wecaninfer,withadegreeofprobabilitythat\napproaches almost to certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the greater\npartofitslandswereimprovedorunimproved,andthatitwaseitherina\nmoreorlessbarbarousstate,orinamoreorlesscivilisedone.\n586 [4] Any rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from\nthedegradationofthevalueofsilverwouldaffectallsortsofgoodsequally,\nandraisetheirpriceuniversallyathird,orafourth,orafifthparthigher,\n191", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\naccording as silver happened to lose a third, or a fourth, or a fifth part of\nitsformervalue. Buttheriseinthepriceofprovisions,whichhasbeenthe\nsubject of so much reasoning and conversation, does not affect all sorts of\nprovisionsequally. Takingthecourseofthepresentcenturyatanaverage,\nthe price of corn, it is acknowledged, even by those who account for this\nrisebythedegradationofthevalueofsilver,hasrisenmuchlessthanthat\nofsomeothersortsofprovisions. Theriseinthepriceofthoseothersorts\nof provisions, therefore, cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of\nthe value of silver. Some other causes must be taken into the account,\nand those which have been above assigned will, perhaps, without having\nrecourse to the supposed degradation of the value of silver, sufficiently\nexplain this rise in those particular sorts of provisions of which the price\nhasactuallyriseninproportiontothatofcorn.\n587 [5] As to the price of corn itself, it has, during the sixty-four first years\nof the present century, and before the late extraordinary course of bad\nseasons,beensomewhatlowerthanitwasduringthesixty-fourlastyears\nof the preceding century. This fact is attested, not only by the accounts\nof Windsor market, but by the public fiars of all the different counties of\nScotland,andbytheaccountsofseveraldifferentmarketsinFrance,which\nhavebeencollectedwithgreatdiligenceandfidelitybyMr.Messanceand\nbyMr.Dupr\u00e9deSt.Maur. Theevidenceismorecompletethancouldwell G.ed.p258\nhave been expected in a matter which is naturally so very difficult to be\nascertained.\n588 [6] As to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years, it\ncanbesufficientlyaccountedforfromthebadnessoftheseasons, without\nsupposinganydegradationinthevalueofsilver. G.ed.p\nThe opinion, therefore, that silver is continually sinking in its value,\nseemsnottobefoundeduponanygoodobservations,eitherupontheprices\nofcorn,oruponthoseofotherprovisions.\n589 [7] Thesamequantityofsilver,itmay,perhaps,besaid,willinthepresent\ntimes,evenaccordingtotheaccountwhichhasbeenheregiven,purchase\na much smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would have\ndone during some part of the last century; and to ascertain whether this\nchange be owing to a rise in the value of those goods, or to a fall in the\nvalue of silver, is only to establish a vain and useless distinction, which\ncan be of no sort of service to the man who has only a certain quantity of\nsilvertogotomarketwith,oracertainfixedrevenueinmoney. Icertainly\ndo not pretend that the knowledge of this distinction will enable him to\nbuycheaper. Itmaynot,however,uponthataccountbealtogetheruseless.\n590 [8] It may be of some use to the public by affording an easy proof of the\nprosperous condition of the country. If the rise in the price of some sorts\nofprovisionsbeowingaltogethertoafallinthevalueofsilver,itisowing\nto a circumstance from which nothing can be inferred but the fertility of\nthe American mines. The real wealth of the country, the annual produce\nof its land and labour, may, notwithstanding this circumstance, be either\n192", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngraduallydeclining,asinPortugalandPoland;orgraduallyadvancing,as\nin most other parts of Europe. But if this rise in the price of some sorts\nof provisions be owing to a rise in the real value of the land which pro-\nduces them, to its increased fertility, or, in consequence of more extended\nimprovementandgoodcultivation,toitshavingbeenrenderedfitforpro-\nducing corn; it is owing to a circumstance which indicates in the clearest\nmanner the prosperous and advancing state of the country. The land con-\nstitutesbyfarthegreatest,themostimportant,andthemostdurablepart\nof the wealth of every extensive country. It may surely be of some use, or,\nat least, it may give some satisfaction to the public, to have so decisive a\nproof of the increasing value of by far the greatest, the most important,\nandthemostdurablepartofitswealth.\n591 [9] It may, too, be of some use to the public in regulating the pecuniary\nreward of some of its inferior servants. If this rise in the price of some\nsortsofprovisionsbeowingtoafallinthevalueofsilver, theirpecuniary\nreward,provideditwasnottoolargebefore,oughtcertainlytobeaugmen- G.ed.p259\nted in proportion to the extent of this fall. If it is not augmented, their\nreal recompense will evidently be so much diminished. But if this rise of\nprice is owing to the increased value, in consequence of the improved fer-\ntilityofthelandwhichproducessuchprovisions,itbecomesamuchnicer\nmatter to judge either in what proportion any pecuniary reward ought to\nbe augmented, or whether it ought to be augmented at all. The extension\nof improvement and cultivation, as it necessarily raises more or less, in\nproportion to the price of corn, that of every sort of animal food, so it as\nnecessarily lowers that of, I believe, every sort of vegetable food. It raises\nthe price of animal food; because a great part of the land which produces\nit, being rendered fit for producing corn, must afford to the landlord and\nfarmer the rent and profit of corn-land. It lowers the price of vegetable\nfood;because,byincreasingthefertilityoftheland,itincreasesitsabund-\nance. Theimprovementsofagriculture,too,introducemanysortsofveget-\nablefood,which,requiringlesslandandnotmorelabourthancorn,come\nmuch cheaper to market. Such are potatoes and maize, or what is called\nIndiancorn, thetwomostimportantimprovementswhichtheagriculture\nofEurope,perhaps,whichEuropeitselfhasreceivedfromthegreatexten-\nsionofitscommerceandnavigation. Manysortsofvegetablefood,besides,\nwhich in the rude state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen-garden,\nand raised only by the spade, come in its improved state to be introduced\ninto common fields, and to be raised by the plough: such as turnips, car-\nrots, cabbages, etc. If in the progress of improvement, therefore, the real\npriceofonespeciesoffoodnecessarilyrises,thatofanotherasnecessarily\nfalls, and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far the rise in\nthe one may be compensated by the fall in the other. When the real price\nof butcher\u2019s meat has once got to its height (which, with regard to every\nsort, except, perhaps, that of hogs\u2019 flesh, it seems to have done through a\ngreatpartofEnglandmorethanacenturyago), anyrisewhichcanafter-\n193", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwards happen in that of any other sort of animal food cannot much affect\nthecircumstancesoftheinferiorranksofpeople. Thecircumstancesofthe\npoorthroughagreatpartofEnglandcannotsurelybesomuchdistressed\nbyanyriseinthepriceofpoultry,fish,wild-fowl,orvenison,astheymust\nberelievedbythefallinthatofpotatoes.\n592 [10] In the present season of scarcity the high price of corn no doubt dis-\ntresses the poor. But in times of moderate plenty, when corn is at its\nordinary or average price, the natural rise in the price of any other sort\nof rude produce cannot much affect them. They suffer more, perhaps, by\nthe artificial rise which has been occasioned by taxes in the price of some\nmanufactured commodities; as of salt, soap, leather, candles, malt, beer, G.ed.p260\nandale,etc.\nEffects of the Progress of Improvement upon\nthe real Price of Manufactures\nG.ed.p\nIt is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradu-\nally the real price of almost all manufactures. That of the manufacturing\nworkmanship diminishes, perhaps, in all of them without exception. In\nconsequenceofbettermachinery,ofgreaterdexterity,andofamoreproper\ndivision and distribution of work, all of which are the natural effects of\nimprovement,amuchsmallerquantityoflabourbecomesrequisiteforex-\necuting any particular piece of work, and though, in consequence of the\nflourishingcircumstancesofthesociety,therealpriceoflabourshouldrise\nvery considerably, yet the great diminution of the quantity will generally\nmuch more than compensate the greatest rise which can happen in the\nprice.\n593 [1] There are, indeed, a few manufactures in which the necessary rise in\nthe real price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the\nadvantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the\nwork. In carpenters\u2019 and joiners\u2019 work, and in the coarser sort of cabinet\nwork,thenecessaryriseintherealpriceofbarrentimber,inconsequence\noftheimprovementofland,willmorethancompensatealltheadvantages\nwhichcanbederivedfromthebestmachinery, thegreatestdexterity, and\nthemostproperdivisionanddistributionofwork.\n594 [2] But in all cases in which the real price of the rude materials either\ndoes not rise at all, or does not rise very much, that of the manufactured\ncommoditysinksveryconsiderably.\n595 [3] Thisdiminutionofpricehas,inthecourseofthepresentandpreceding\ncentury, been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the ma-\nterials are the coarser metals. A better movement of a watch, that about\nthe middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds,\nmay now perhaps be had for twenty shillings. In the work of cutiers and\n194", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlocksmiths, in all the toys which are made of the coarser metals, and in\nall those goods which are commonly known by the name of Birmingham\nand Sheffield ware, there has been, during the same period, a very great\nreductionofprice,thoughnotaltogethersogreatasinwatch-work. Ithas,\nhowever, been sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part of\nEurope,whoinmanycasesacknowledgethattheycanproducenoworkof\nequal goodness for double, or even for triple the price. There are perhaps\nnomanufacturesinwhichthedivisionoflabourcanbecarriedfurther, or\nin which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of improve- G.ed.p261\nments,thanthoseofwhichthematerialsarethecoarsermetals.\n596 [4] In the clothing manufacture there has, during the same period, been\nno such sensible reduction of price. The price of superfine cloth, I have\nbeen assured, on the contrary, has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\nyears, risen somewhat in proportion to its quality; owing, it was said, to\na considerable rise in the price of the material, which consists altogether\nof Spanish wool. That of the Yorkshire cloth, which is made altogether of\nEnglish wool, is said indeed, during the course of the present century, to\nhave fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality. Quality, however, is\nso very disputable a matter that I look upon all information of this kind\nas somewhat uncertain. In the clothing manufacture, the division of la-\nbour is nearly the same now as it was a century ago, and the machinery\nemployedisnotverydifferent. Theremay,however,havebeensomesmall\nimprovementsinboth,whichmayhaveoccasionedsomereductionofprice.\n597 [5] But the reduction will appear much more sensible and undeniable if\nwe compare the price of this manufacture in the present times with what\nit was in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth century,\nwhen the labour was probably much less subdivided, and the machinery\nemployedmuchmoreimperfect,thanitisatpresent.\n598 [6] In 1487, being the 4th of Henry VII, it was enacted that \u2018whosoever\nshall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained, or of other\ngrained cloth of the finest making, above sixteen shillings, shall forfeit\nforty shillings for every yard so sold.\u2019 Sixteen shillings, therefore, con-\ntaining about the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty shillings of\nourpresentmoney, was, atthattime, reckonednotanunreasonableprice\nfor a yard of the finest cloth; and as this is a sumptuary law, such cloth,\nit is probable, had usually been sold somewhat dearer. A guinea may be\nreckoned the highest price in the present times. Even though the quality\nof the cloths, therefore, should be supposed equal, and that of the present\ntimesismostprobablymuchsuperior,yet,evenuponthissupposition,the\nmoneypriceofthefinestclothappearstohavebeenconsiderablyreduced\nsince the end of the fifteenth century. But its real price has been much\nmorereduced. Sixshillingsandeightpencewasthen,andlongafterwards,\nreckonedtheaveragepriceofaquarterofwheat. Sixteenshillings,there-\nfore, was the price of two quarters and more than three bushels of wheat. G.ed.p262\nValuing a quarter of wheat in the present times at eight-and-twenty shil-\n195", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlings, the real price of a yard of fine cloth must, in those times, have been\nequal to at least three pounds six shillings and sixpence of our present\nmoney. The man who bought it must have parted with the command of a\nquantityoflabourandsubsistenceequaltowhatthatsumwouldpurchase\ninthepresenttimes.\n599 [7] The reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture, though con-\nsiderable,hasnotbeensogreatasinthatofthefine.\n600 [8] In1643,beingthe3rdofEdwardIV,itwasenactedthat\u2018noservantin\nhusbandry, nor common labourer, nor servant to any artificer inhabiting\nout of a city or burgh shall use or wear in their clothing any cloth above\ntwo shillings the broad yard.\u2019 In the 3rd of Edward IV, two shillings con-\ntainedverynearlythesamequantityofsilverasfourofourpresentmoney.\nButtheYorkshireclothwhichisnowsoldatfourshillingstheyardisprob-\nablymuchsuperiortoanythatwasthenmadeforthewearingofthevery\npoorestorderofcommonservants. Eventhemoneypriceoftheirclothing,\ntherefore, may, in proportion to the quality, be somewhat cheaper in the\npresent than it was in those ancient times. The real price is certainly a\ngood deal cheaper. Tenpence was then reckoned what is called the mod-\nerate and reasonable price of a bushel of wheat. Two shillings, therefore,\nwas the price of two bushels and near two pecks of wheat, which in the\npresent times, at three shillings and sixpence the bushel, would be worth\neight shillings and ninepence. For a yard of this cloth the poor servant\nmust have parted with the power of purchasing a quantity of subsistence\nequaltowhateightshillingsandninepencewouldpurchaseinthepresent\ntimes. This is a sumptuary law too, restraining the luxury and extravag-\nanceofthepoor. Theirclothing,therefore,hadcommonlybeenmuchmore\nexpensive.\n601 [9] Thesameorderofpeopleare,bythesamelaw,prohibitedfromwearing\nhose, of which the price should exceed fourteenpence the pair, equal to\nabouteight-and-twentypenceofourpresentmoney. Butfourteenpencewas\nin those times the price of a bushel and near two pecks of wheat, which,\nin the present times, at three and sixpence the bushel, would cost five\nshillings and threepence. We should in the present times consider this as\na very high price for a pair of stockings, to a servant of the poorest and\nlowestorder. Hemust,however,inthosetimeshavepaidwhatwasreally\nequivalenttothispriceforthem.\n602 [10] In the time of Edward IV the art of knitting stockings was probably\nnotknowninanypartofEurope.

She\nreceivedthemasapresentfromtheSpanishambassador.\n603 [11] Bothinthecoarseandinthefinewoollenmanufacture,themachinery G.ed.p263\nemployed was much more imperfect in those ancient than it is in the\npresent times. It has since received three very capital improvements, be-\nsides,probably,manysmalleronesofwhichitmaybedifficulttoascertain\n196", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\neither the number or the importance. The three capital improvements\nare: first, the exchange of the rock and spindle for the spinning-wheel,\nwhich, with the same quantity of labour, will perform more than double\nthequantityofwork. Secondly,theuseofseveralveryingeniousmachines\nwhich facilitate and abridge in a still greater proportion the winding of\ntheworstedandwoollenyarn,ortheproperarrangementofthewarpand\nwoof before they are put into the loom; an operation which, previous to\nthe invention of those machines, must have been extremely tedious and\ntroublesome. Thirdly, the employment of the fulling mill for thickening\nthe cloth, instead of treading it in water. Neither wind nor water mills of\nanykindwereknowninEnglandsoearlyasthebeginningofthesixteenth\ncentury,nor,sofarasIknow,inanyotherpartofEuropenorthoftheAlps.\nTheyhadbeenintroducedintoItalysometimebefore.\n604 [12] Theconsiderationofthesecircumstancesmay,perhaps,insomemeas-\nure explain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine\nmanufacturewassomuchhigherinthoseancientthanitisinthepresent\ntimes. It cost a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods to market.\nWhen they were brought thither, therefore, they must have purchased or\nexchangedforthepriceofagreaterquantity.\n605 [13] The coarse manufacture probably was, in those ancient times, carried\non in England, in the same manner as it always has been in countries\nwhereartsandmanufacturesareintheirinfancy. Itwasprobablyahouse-\nholdmanufacture,inwhicheverydifferentpartoftheworkwasoccasion-\nallyperformedbyallthedifferentmembersofalmosteveryprivatefamily;\nbut so as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do, and not\nto be the principal business from which any of them derived the greater\npart of their subsistence. The work which is performed in this manner, it\nhas already been observed, comes always much cheaper to market than\nthatwhichistheprincipalorsolefundoftheworkman\u2019ssubsistence. The\nfine manufacture, on the other hand, was not in those times carried on in\nEngland, but in the rich and commercial country of Flanders; and it was\nprobably conducted then, in the same manner as now, by people who de-\nrived the whole, or the principal part of their subsistence from it. It was,\nbesides,aforeignmanufacture,andmusthavepaidsomeduty,theancient\ncustom of tonnage and poundage at least, to the king. This duty, indeed,\nwould not probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe G.ed.p264\nto restrain, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but\nrather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to sup-\nply,ataseasyarateaspossible,thegreatmenwiththeconveniencesand\nluxuries which they wanted, and which the industry of their own country\ncouldnotaffordthem.\n606 [14] The consideration of these circumstances may perhaps in some meas-\nure explain to us why, in those ancient times, the real price of the coarse\nmanufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, so much lower than in\nthepresenttimes.\n197", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nCONCLUSION of the CHAPTER\nG.ed.p\nI shall conclude this very long chapter with observing that every im-\nprovement in the circumstances of the society tends either directly or in-\ndirectly to raise the real rent of land, to increase the real wealth of the\nlandlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the produce of the labour\nofotherpeople.\n607 [1] Theextensionofimprovementandcultivationtendstoraiseitdirectly.\nThelandlord\u2019sshareoftheproducenecessarilyincreaseswiththeincrease\noftheproduce.\n608 [2] That rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land,\nwhich is first the effect of extended improvement and cultivation, and af-\nterwards the cause of their being still further extended, the rise in the\npriceofcattle,forexample,tendstootoraisetherentoflanddirectly,and\nin a still greater proportion. The real value of the landlord\u2019s share, his\nreal command of the labour of other people, not only rises with the real\nvalue of the produce, but the proportion of his share to the whole produce\nriseswithit. Thatproduce,aftertheriseinitsrealprice,requiresnomore\nlabour to collect it than before. A smaller proportion of it will, therefore,\nbe sufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the stock which employs\nthat labour. A greater proportion of it must, consequently, belong to the\nlandlord.\n609 [3] Allthoseimprovementsintheproductivepowersoflabour,whichtend\ndirectly to reduce the real price of manufactures, tend indirectly to raise\ntherealrentofland. Thelandlordexchangesthatpartofhisrudeproduce,\nwhichisoverandabovehisownconsumption, orwhatcomestothesame\nthing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured produce. Whatever\nreduces the real price of the latter, raises that of the former.

Every\nman endeavours to supply by his own industry his own occasional wants\nas they occur.

The far greater part of them are supplied by the\nproduce of other men\u2019s labour, which he purchases with the produce, or,\nwhat is the same thing, with the price of the produce of his own. But this\npurchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labour\nhas not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of different kinds,\ntherefore, must be stored up somewhere sufficient to maintain him, and\nto supply him with the materials and tools of his work till such time, at\nleast, as both these events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply\nhimselfentirelytohispeculiarbusiness,unlessthereisbeforehandstored G.ed.p277\nupsomewhere,eitherinhisownpossessionorinthatofsomeotherperson,\na stock sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with the materials\nandtoolsofhiswork,tillhehasnotonlycompleted,butsoldhisweb.

As the division of labour advances,\ntherefore, in order to give constant employment to an equal number of\nworkmen, an equal stock of provisions, and a greater stock of materials\nandtoolsthanwhatwouldhavebeennecessaryinaruderstateofthings,\nmust be accumulated beforehand. But the number of workmen in every\nbranch of business generally increases with the division of labour in that", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbranch,orratheritistheincreaseoftheirnumberwhichenablesthemto\nclassandsubdividethemselvesinthismanner.\n619 [4] As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on\nthis great improvement in the productive powers of labour, so that accu-\nmulation naturally leads to this improvement. The person who employs\nhis stock in maintaining labour, necessarily wishes to employ it in such\na manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible. He en-\ndeavours, therefore, both to make among his workmen the most proper\ndistribution of employment, and to furnish them with the best machines\nwhich he can either invent or afford to purchase. His abilities in both\nthese respects are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock, or to\nthenumberofpeoplewhomitcanemploy. Thequantityofindustry,there-\nfore, not only increases in every country with the increase of the stock\nwhich employs it, but, in consequence of that increase, the same quantity\nofindustryproducesamuchgreaterquantityofwork.\n620 [5] Such are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry\nanditsproductivepowers.\n621 [6] InthefollowingbookIhaveendeavouredtoexplainthenatureofstock,\nthe effects of its accumulation into capitals of different kinds, and the\neffects of the different employments of those capitals. This book is di-\nvided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I have endeavoured to show\nwhatarethedifferentpartsorbranchesintowhichthestock,eitherofan\nindividual, or of a great society, naturally divides itself. In the second, I G.ed.p278\nhaveendeavouredtoexplainthenatureandoperationofmoneyconsidered\nasaparticularbranchofthegeneralstockofthesociety. Thestockwhich\nis accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the person to\nwhom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person. In the third and\nfourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in which it\noperates in both these situations. The fifth and last chapter treats of the\ndifferent effects which the different employments of capital immediately\nproduce upon the quantity both of national industry, and of the annual\nproduceoflandandlabour.\n213", "CHAPTER I\nG.ed.p279\nOF THE DIVISION OF STOCK\n622 [1] WHENthestockwhichamanpossessesisnomorethansufficienttomain-\ntain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any\nrevenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and endeavours\nby his labour to acquire something which may supply its place before it\nbe consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived from his la-\nbour only. This is the state of the greater part of the labouring poor in all\ncountries.\n623 [2] But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or\nyears, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part\nofit;reservingonlysomuchforhisimmediateconsumptionasmaymain-\ntain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock, therefore,\nis distinguished into two parts. That part which, he expects, is to afford\nhimthisrevenue,iscalledhiscapital.

He makes\naprofitoftheonebykeepingitinhisownpossession,andoftheotherby\nparting with it. The price or value of his labouring cattle is a fixed cap-\nital in the same manner as that of the instruments of husbandry. Their\nmaintenance is a circulating capital in the same manner as that of the\nlabouring servants. The farmer makes his profit by keeping the labour-\ningcattle, andby parting withtheirmaintenance.

Clothes, and household furniture,\nin the same manner, sometimes yield a revenue, and thereby serve in the\nfunction of a capital to particular persons. In countries where masquer-\nades are common, it is a trade to let out masquerade dresses for a night.\nUpholsterers frequently let furniture by the month or by the year. Un-\ndertakers let the furniture of funerals by the day and by the week. Many\npeople let furnished houses, and get a rent, not only for the use of the\nhouse, but for that of the furniture. The revenue, however, which is de-\nrivedfromsuchthingsmustalwaysbeultimatelydrawnfromsomeother\nsourceofrevenue.

Itiscomposedlikewiseoffourparts:\n640 [19] First,ofthemoneybymeansofwhichalltheotherthreearecirculated\nanddistributedtotheirproperconsumers:\n641 [20] Secondly, of the stock of provisions which are in the possession of the G.ed.p283\nbutcher, the grazier, the farmer, the corn-merchant, the brewer, etc., and\nfromthesaleofwhichtheyexpecttoderiveaprofit:\n642 [21] Thirdly,ofthematerials,whetheraltogetherrude,ormoreorlessman-\nufactured, of clothes, furniture, and building, which are not yet made up\nintoanyofthosethreeshapes,butwhichremaininthehandsofthegrow-\ners, the manufacturers, the mercers and drapers, the timber merchants,\nthecarpentersandjoiners,thebrickmakers,etc.\n643 [22] Fourthly, and lastly, of the work which is made up and completed, but\nwhich is still in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer, and not yet\ndisposed of or distributed to the proper consumers; such as the finished\nwork which we frequently find ready-made in the shops of the smith, the\n217", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncabinet-maker, the goldsmith, the jeweller, the china-merchant, etc. The\ncirculating capital consists in this manner, of the provisions, materials,\nand finished work of all kinds that are in the hands of their respective\ndealers,andofthemoneythatisnecessaryforcirculatinganddistributing\nthemtothosewhoarefinallytouseortoconsumethem.\n644 [23] Of these four parts, three, provisions, materials, and finished work,\nare,eitherannually,orinalongerorshorterperiod,regularlywithdrawn\nfrom it, and placed either in the fixed capital or in the stock reserved for\nimmediateconsumption.\n645 [24] Every fixed capital is both originally derived from, and requires to be\ncontinuallysupportedbyacirculatingcapital.

Theyrequire,too,acapitalofthesamekind\ntokeeptheminconstantrepair.\n646 [25] No fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating\ncapital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce\nnothing without the circulating capital which affords the materials they\nare employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ\nthem. Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circu-\nlatingcapital,whichmaintainsthelabourerswhocultivateandcollectits\nproduce.\n647 [26] To maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for imme-\ndiateconsumptionisthesoleendandpurposebothofthefixedandcircu-\nlatingcapitals.

These supplies are principally drawn from\nthreesources,theproduceofland,ofmines,andoffisheries. Theseafford\ncontinualsuppliesofprovisionsandmaterials,ofwhichpartisafterwards\nwrought up into finished work, and by which are replaced the provisions,\nmaterials, and finished work continually withdrawn from the circulating\ncapital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for maintaining and\naugmenting that part of it which consists in money. For though, in the\nordinary course of business, this part is not, like the other three, neces-\nsarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches\nof the general stock of the society, it must, however, like all other things,\nbe wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too, be either lost or sent\nabroad, and must, therefore, require continual, though, no doubt, much\nsmallersupplies.\n649 [28] Land, mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and a circulating\n218", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncapitaltocultivatethem;andtheirproducereplaceswithaprofit,notonly\nthose capitals, but all the others in the society. Thus the farmer annu-\nally replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had consumed\nandthematerialswhichbehadwroughtuptheyearbefore;andtheman-\nufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had wasted\nandwornoutinthesametime. Thisistherealexchangethatisannually\nmade between those two orders of people, though it seldom happens that\nthe rude produce of the one and the manufactured produce of the other,\nare directly bartered for one another; because it seldom happens that the\nfarmersellshiscornandhiscattle,hisflaxandhiswool,totheverysame\nperson of whom he chooses to purchase the clothes, furniture, and instru-\nments of trade which he wants. He sells, therefore, his rude produce for\nmoney,withwhichhecanpurchase,whereveritistobehad,themanufac-\nturedproducehehasoccasionfor.

It is the produce\nof land which draws the fish from the waters; and it is the produce of the\nsurfaceoftheearthwhichextractsthemineralsfromitsbowels.\n650 [29] The produce of land, mines, and fisheries, when their natural fertility\nis equal, is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the cap-\nitals employed about them. When the capitals are equal and equally well\napplied,itisinproportiontotheirnaturalfertility.\n651 [30] Inallcountrieswherethereistolerablesecurity,everymanofcommon\nunderstandingwill endeavour toemploy whateverstock he cancommand G.ed.p285\nin procuring either present enjoyment or future profit.

This is said to be a common practice in Turkey, in Indostan,\nand, I believe, in most other governments of Asia. It seems to have been\na common practice among our ancestors during the violence of the feudal\ngovernment.

The whole price or exchangeable\nvalueofthatannualproducemustresolveitselfintothesamethreeparts,\nandbeparcelledoutamongthedifferentinhabitantsofthecountry,either\nas the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their\nland.\n655 [3] But though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and la-\nbour of every country is thus divided among and constitutes a revenue to\nits different inhabitants, yet as in the rent of a private estate we distin-\nguish between the gross rent and the net rent, so may we likewise in the\nrevenueofalltheinhabitantsofagreatcountry.\n656 [4] Thegrossrentofaprivateestatecomprehendswhateverispaidbythe\nfarmer; the net rent, what remains free to the landlord, after deducting\nthe expense of management, of repairs, and all other necessary charges;\nor what, without hurting his estate, he can afford to place in his stock re-\nserved for immediate consumption, or to spend upon his table, equipage,", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe ornaments of his house and furniture, his private enjoyments and\namusements.

Their real wealth, too, is in proportion, not to their\ngross,buttotheirnetrevenue.\n658 [6] The whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must evidently be\nexcludedfromthenetrevenueofthesociety. Neitherthematerialsneces-\nsary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade, their\nprofitablebuildings,etc.,northeproduceofthelabournecessaryforfash-\nioning those materials into the proper form, can ever make any part of it.\nThe price of that labour may indeed make a part of it; as the workmen so\nemployedmayplacethewholevalueoftheirwagesintheirstockreserved\nforimmediateconsumption.

In a farm where all the necessary buildings,\nfences,drains,communications,etc.,areinthemostperfectgoodorder,the\nsame number of labourers and labouring cattle will raise a much greater\nproduce than in one of equal extent and equally good ground, but not fur-\nnished with equal conveniencies. In manufactures the same number of\nhands, assisted with the best machinery, will work up a much greater\nquantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of trade. The\nexpense which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind, is al-\nwaysrepaidwithgreatprofit,andincreasestheannualproducebyamuch\ngreater value than that of the support which such improvements require.\nThis support, however, still requires a certain portion of that produce.

A\ncertainquantityofmaterials,andthelabourofacertainnumberofwork-\nmen, which had before been employed in supporting a more complex and\n222", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nexpensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to augment the quantity\nof work which that or any other machinery is useful only for performing.\nTheundertakerofsomegreatmanufactorywhoemploysathousandayear\nin the maintenance of his machinery, if he can reduce this expense to five\nhundredwillnaturallyemploytheotherfivehundredinpurchasinganad- G.ed.p288\nditionalquantityofmaterialstobewroughtupbyanadditionalnumberof\nworkmen. The quantityofthatwork, therefore, whichhismachinerywas\nusefulonlyforperforming,willnaturallybeaugmented,andwithitallthe\nadvantageandconveniencywhichthesocietycanderivefromthatwork.\n660 [8] The expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country may\nvery properly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate. The ex-\npenseofrepairsmayfrequentlybenecessaryforsupportingtheproduceof\nthe estate, and consequently both the gross and the net rent of the land-\nlord. When by a more proper direction, however, it can be diminished\nwithout occasioning any diminution of produce, the gross rent remains at\nleastthesameasbefore,andthenetrentisnecessarilyaugmented.\n661 [9] But though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is thus\nnecessarilyexcludedfromthenetrevenueofthesociety,itisnotthesame\ncase with that of maintaining the circulating capital. Of the four parts\nofwhichthislattercapitaliscomposed,money,provisions,materials,and\nfinished work, the three last, it has already been observed, are regularly\nwithdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital of the society, or\nin their stock reserved for immediate consumption.

Acertainquantityofveryvaluablematerials,goldandsilver,and\nof very curious labour, instead of augmenting the stock reserved for im-\nmediateconsumption, thesubsistence, conveniencies, andamusementsof\nindividuals, is employed in supporting that great but expensive instru-\nment of commerce, by means of which every individual in the society has\nhis subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements regularly distributed to\nhimintheirproperproportions.\n666 [14] Secondly,asthemachinesandinstrumentsofatrade,etc.,whichcom-\npose the fixed capital either of an individual or of a society, make no part\neither of the gross or of the net revenue of either; so money, by means\nof which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among\nall its different members, makes itself no part of that revenue. The great\nwheel of circulation is altogether different from the goods which are cir-\nculated by means of it. The revenue of the society consists altogether in\nthose goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them. In computing\neither the gross or the net revenue of any society, we must always, from\ntheirwholeannualcirculationofmoneyandgoods,deductthewholevalue\nof the money, of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of\neither.\n667 [15] It is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition\nappear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and un-\nderstood,itisalmostself-evident.\n668 [16] When we talk of any particular sum of money, we sometimes mean\nnothing but the metal pieces of which it is composed; and sometimes we\ninclude in our meaning some obscure reference to the goods which can be\nhadinexchangeforit,ortothepowerofpurchasingwhichthepossession\nofitconveys. ThuswhenwesaythatthecirculatingmoneyofEnglandhas\nbeen computed at eighteen millions, we mean only to express the amount\nof the metal pieces, which some writers have computed, or rather have\nsupposed to circulate in that country. But when we say that a man is\nworthfiftyorahundredpoundsayear,wemeancommonlytoexpressnot\nonly the amount of the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, but\nthe value of the goods which he can annually purchase or consume. We\nmeancommonlytoascertainwhatisoroughttobehiswayofliving,orthe\nquantity and quality of the necessaries and conveniencies of life in which\nhecanwithproprietyindulgehimself.\n669 [17] When, by any particular sum of money, we mean not only to express G.ed.p290\nthe amount of the metal pieces of which it is composed, but to include in\n224", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nits signification some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in\nexchange for them, the wealth or revenue which it in this case denotes,\nisequalonlytooneofthetwovalueswhicharethusintimatedsomewhat\nambiguouslybythesameword,andtothelattermoreproperlythantothe\nformer,tothemoney\u2019sworthmoreproperlythantothemoney.\n670 [18] Thusifaguineabetheweeklypensionofaparticularperson,hecanin\nthe course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of subsistence,\nconveniencies,andamusements. Inproportionasthisquantityisgreator\nsmall, soarehisrealriches, hisrealweeklyrevenue.

A guinea may be\nconsideredasabillforacertainquantityofnecessariesandconveniencies\nupon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood. The revenue of the person\nto whom it is paid, does not so properly consist in the piece of gold, as in\nwhat he can get for it, or in what he can exchange it for. If it could be\nexchangedfornothing,itwould,likeabilluponabankrupt,beofnomore\nvaluethanthemostuselesspieceofpaper.\n672 [20] Though the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants\nof any country, in the same manner, may be, and in reality frequently is\npaidtotheminmoney,theirrealriches,however,therealweeklyoryearly\nrevenue of all of them taken together, must always be great or small in\nproportiontothequantityofconsumablegoodswhichtheycanallofthem\npurchasewiththismoney. Thewholerevenueofallofthemtakentogether\nis evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable goods; but\nonly to one or other of those two values, and to the latter more properly\nthantotheformer.\n673 [21] Though we frequently, therefore, express a person\u2019s revenue by the\nmetal pieces which are annually paid to him, it is because the amount of\nthose pieces regulates the extent of his power of purchasing, or the value\nofthegoodswhichhecanannuallyaffordtoconsume. Westillconsiderhis\nrevenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming, and not\ninthepieceswhichconveyit.\n674 [22] Butifthisissufficientlyevidentevenwithregardtoanindividual,itis\nstillmoresowithregardtoasociety. Theamountofthemetalpieceswhich\nareannuallypaidtoanindividual,isoftenpreciselyequaltohisrevenue, G.ed.p291\nandisuponthataccounttheshortestandbestexpressionofitsvalue. But\nthe amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a society can never be\nequal to the revenue of all its members.

But the power of\npurchasing,orthegoodswhichcansuccessivelybeboughtwiththewhole\nof those money pensions as they are successively paid, must always be\nprecisely of the same value with those pensions; as must likewise be the\nrevenue of the different persons to whom they are paid. That revenue,\ntherefore, cannot consist in those metal pieces, of which the amount is so\nmuch inferior to its value, but in the power of purchasing, in the goods\nwhich can successively be bought with them as they circulate from hand\ntohand.\n675 [23] Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument\nof commerce, like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part\nand a very valuable part of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of\nthe society to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces of which it\nis composed, in the course of their annual circulation, distribute to every\nmantherevenuewhichproperlybelongstohim,theymakethemselvesno\npartofthatrevenue.\n676 [24] Thirdly, and lastly, the machines and instruments of trade, etc., which\ncompose the fixed capital, bear this further resemblance to that part of\nthe circulating capital which consists in money; that as every saving in\nthe expense of erecting and supporting those machines, which does not\ndiminish the productive powers of labour, is an improvement of the net\nrevenue of the society, so every saving in the expense of collecting and\nsupporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money, is\nanimprovementofexactlythesamekind.\n677 [25] Itissufficientlyobvious,andithaspartly,too,beenexplainedalready, G.ed.p292\ninwhatmannereverysavingintheexpenseofsupportingthefixedcapital\nis an improvement of the net revenue of the society. The whole capital\nof the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided between his fixed\nand his circulating capital. While his whole capital remains the same,\nthe smaller the one part, the greater must necessarily be the other. It is\nthecirculatingcapitalwhichfurnishesthematerialsandwagesoflabour,\nand puts industry into motion. Every saving, therefore, in the expense\nof maintaining the fixed capital, which does not diminish the productive\npowersoflabour,mustincreasethefundwhichputsindustryintomotion,\nandconsequentlytheannualproduceoflandandlabour,therealrevenue\nofeverysociety.\n678 [26] Thesubstitutionofpaperintheroomofgoldandsilvermoney,replaces\na very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and\nsometimesequallyconvenient. Circulationcomestobecarriedonbyanew\nwheel, which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one.\nBut in what manner this operation is performed, and in what manner it\ntends to increase either the gross or the net revenue of the society, is not\naltogethersoobvious,andmaythereforerequiresomefurtherexplication.\n679 [27] There are several different sorts of paper money; but the circulating\n226", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnotesofbanksandbankersarethespecieswhichisbestknown,andwhich\nseemsbestadaptedforthispurpose.\n680 [28] Whenthepeopleofanyparticularcountryhavesuchconfidenceinthe\nfortune, probity, and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that\nhe is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissory notes as\nare likely to be at any time presented to him; those notes come to have\nthesamecurrencyasgoldandsilvermoney,fromtheconfidencethatsuch\nmoneycanatanytimebehadforthem.\n681 [29] A particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory\nnotes, to the extent, we shall suppose, of a hundred thousand pounds.\nAs those notes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the\nsame interest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the\nsourceofhisgain. Thoughsomeofthosenotesarecontinuallycomingback\nupon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months and\nyears together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore, notes\nto the extent of a hundred thousand pounds, twenty thousand pounds in\ngold and silver may frequently be a sufficient provision for answering oc- G.ed.p293\ncasional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty thousand pounds\nin gold and silver perform all the functions which a hundred thousand\ncould otherwise have performed.

Though\nsome particular men may sometimes increase their expense very consid-\nerably though their revenue does not increase at all, we may be assured\nthat no class or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles\nofcommonprudencedonotalwaysgoverntheconductofeveryindividual,\nthey always influence that of the majority of every class or order. But the\nrevenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot, in the smal-\nlestdegree,beincreasedbythoseoperationsofbanking.

The greater part of it will naturally be destined for the employment\nofindustry,andnotforthemaintenanceofidleness.\n689 [37] When we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating cap-\nital of any society can employ, we must always have regard to those parts\nof it only which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work: the\nother, which consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those\nthree, must always be deducted. In order to put industry into motion,\nthreethingsarerequisite;materialstoworkupon,toolstoworkwith,and\nthewagesorrecompenseforthesakeofwhichtheworkisdone. Moneyis\nneither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the\nwages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real rev-\nenue,likethatofallothermen,consists,notinmoney,butinthemoney\u2019s\nworth;notinthemetalpieces,butinwhatcanbegotforthem.\n690 [38] Thequantityofindustrywhichanycapitalcanemploymust,evidently,\nbe equal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials,\ntools, and a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work. Money may\nberequisiteforpurchasingthematerialsandtoolsofthework,aswellas\nthe maintenance of the workmen. But the quantity of industry which the\nwhole capital can employ is certainly not equal both to the money which G.ed.p296\npurchases, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are pur-\nchased with it; but only to one or other of those two values, and to the\nlattermoreproperlythantotheformer.\n691 [39] When paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the\nquantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole circu-\nlatingcapitalcansupply,maybeincreasedbythewholevalueofgoldand\nsilver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole value\n229", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the goods\nwhich are circulated and distributed by means of it. The operation, in\nsomemeasure,resemblesthatoftheundertakerofsomegreatwork,who,\ninconsequenceofsomeimprovementinmechanics,takesdownhisoldma-\nchinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new to\nhiscirculatingcapital, tothefundfromwhichhefurnishesmaterialsand\nwagestohisworkmen.\n692 [40] What is the proportion which the circulating money of any country\nbears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it,\nit is, perhaps, impossible to determine. It has been computed by different\nauthorsatafifth,atatenth,atatwentieth,andatathirtiethpartofthat\nvalue. But how small soever the proportion which the circulating money\nmay bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and\nfrequentlybutasmallpart,ofthatproduce,iseverdestinedforthemain-\ntenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable proportion\nto that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper, the gold and\nsilver necessary for circulation is reduced to, perhaps, a fifth part of the\nformerquantity,ifthevalueofonlythegreaterpartoftheotherfour-fifths\nbeaddedtothefundswhicharedestinedforthemaintenanceofindustry, G.ed.p297\nitmustmakeaveryconsiderableadditiontothequantityofthatindustry,\nand,consequently,tothevalueoftheannualproduceoflandandlabour.\n693 [41] An operation of this kind has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty\nyears,beenperformedinScotland,bytheerectionofnewbankingcompan-\nies in almost every considerable town, and even in some country villages.\nThe effects of it have been precisely those above described. The business\nofthecountryisalmostentirelycarriedonbymeansofthepaperofthose\ndifferentbankingcompanies,withwhichpurchasesandpaymentsofkinds\nare commonly made. Silver very seldom appears except in the change of\natwentyshillingsbanknote,andgoldstillseldomer. Butthoughthecon-\nduct of all those different companies has not been unexceptionable, and\nhas accordingly required an act of Parliament to regulate it, the country,\nnotwithstanding, has evidently derived great benefit from their trade.

The whole value of the gold and silver,\ntherefore, which circulated in Scotland before the union, cannot be estim-\natedatlessthanamillionsterling. Itseemstohaveconstitutedalmostthe\nwhole circulation of that country; for though the circulation of the Bank\nof Scotland, which had then no rival, was considerable, it seems to have\nmade but a very small part of the whole. In the present times the whole\ncirculation of Scotland cannot be estimated at less than two millions, of\nwhich that part which consists in gold and silver most probably does not\namount to half a million. But though the circulating gold and silver of\nScotland have suffered so great a diminution during this period, its real\nriches and prosperity do not appear to have suffered any. Its agriculture,\nmanufactures, and trade, on the contrary, the annual produce of its land\nandlabour,haveevidentlybeenaugmented.\n695 [43] It is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that is, by advancing\nmoney upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and\nbankersissuetheirpromissorynotes.

If there\nare two merchants, one in London and the other in Edinburgh, who em- G.ed.p300\nploy equal stocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant\ncan, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade and give employment\nto a greater number of people than the London merchant. The London\nmerchant must always keep by him a considerable sum of money, either\nin his own coffers, or in those of his banker, who gives him no interest\nfor it, in order to answer the demands continually coming upon him for\npayment of the goods which he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary\namount of this sum be supposed five hundred pounds.

When they actually come upon\nhim,hesatisfiesthemfromhiscashaccountwiththebank,andgradually\nreplaces the sum borrowed with the money or paper which comes in from\nthe occasional sales of his goods.

Hencethegreat\nbenefitwhichthecountryhasderivedfromthistrade.\n699 [47] The facility of discounting bills of exchange it may be thought indeed,\ngives the English merchants a conveniency equivalent to the cash ac-\ncounts of the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it must be\nremembered, can discount their bills of exchange as easily as the English\nmerchants;andhave,besides,theadditionalconveniencyoftheircashac-\ncounts.\n700 [48] Thewholepapermoneyofeverykindwhichcaneasilycirculateinany\ncountry never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it sup-\nplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would\ncirculate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes, for\nexample, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of\nthat currency which can easily circulate there cannot exceed the sum of\ngold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual ex-\nchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within\nthat country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, G.ed.p301\nas the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circu-\nlation of the country, it must immediately return upon the banks to be\nexchanged for gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive\nthattheyhadmoreofthispaperthanwasnecessaryfortransactingtheir\nbusiness at home, and as they could not send it abroad, they would im-\nmediately demand payment of it from the banks. When this superfluous\npaper was converted into gold and silver, they could easily find a use for\nit by sending it abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the\nshape of paper. There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the\nbanks to the whole extent of this superfluous paper, and, if they showed\nany difficulty or backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the\nalarmwhichthiswouldoccasionnecessarilyincreasingtherun.\n701 [49] Over and above the expenses which are common to every branch of\ntrade; such as the expense of house-rent, the wages of servants, clerks,\naccountants, etc.; the expenses peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in two\narticles: first, in the expense of keeping at all times in its coffers, for an-\nswering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes, a large sum\nof money, of which it loses the interest; and, secondly, in the expense of\nreplenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied by answering such\noccasionaldemands.\n233", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n702 [50] Abankingcompany,whichissuesmorepaperthancanbeemployedin\nthe circulation of the country, and of which the excess is continually re-\nturninguponthemforpayment,oughttoincreasethequantityofgoldand\nsilver, which they keep at all times in their coffers, not only in proportion\nto this excessive increase of their circulation, but in a much greater pro-\nportion;theirnotesreturninguponthemmuchfasterthaninproportionto\nthe excess of their quantity.

Such a company, therefore, must, in proportion to this forced in-\ncrease of their business, increase the second article of their expense still\nmorethanthefirst.\n704 [52] Let us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank, which the cir-\nculation of the country can easily absorb and employ, amounts exactly to\nforty thousand pounds; and that for answering occasional demands, this\nbank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in\ngoldandsilver.

For this\ngreat coinage the bank (in consequence of the worn and degraded state\nintowhichthegoldcoinhadfallenafewyearsago)wasfrequentlyobliged\nto purchase gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce, which\nit soon after issued in coin at 3l.17s.101d. an ounce, losing in this man-\n2\nnerbetweentwoandahalfandthreepercentuponthecoinageofsovery\nlarge a sum. Though the bank therefore paid no seignorage, though the\ngovernment was properly at the expense of the coinage, this liberality of\ngovernmentdidnotpreventaltogethertheexpenseofthebank.\n707 [55] The Scotch banks, in consequence of an excess of the same kind, were G.ed.p303\nall obliged to employ constantly agents at London to collect money for\nthem, at an expense which was seldom below one and a half or two per\ncent. Thismoneywassentdownbythewaggon,andinsuredbythecarri-\ners at an additional expense of three quarters per cent or fifteen shillings\non the hundred pounds.

TheBankofEngland,itistobeobserved,\nby supplying its own coffers with coin, is indirectly obliged to supply the G.ed.p304\nwhole kingdom, into which coin is continually flowing from those coffers\nin a great variety of ways. Whatever coin therefore was wanted to sup-\nport this excessive circulation both of Scotch and English paper money,\nwhatever vacuities this excessive circulation occasioned in the necessary\ncoin of the kingdom, the Bank of England was obliged to supply them.\nThe Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own\nimprudence and inattention. But the Bank of England paid very dearly,\nnot only for its own imprudence, but for the much greater imprudence of\nalmostalltheScotchbanks.\n709 [57] The overtrading of some bold projectors in both parts of the United\nKingdom was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper\nmoney.\n710 [58] Whatabankcanwithproprietyadvancetoamerchantorundertakerof\nanykind,isnoteitherthewholecapitalwithwhichhetrades,orevenany\nconsiderable part of that capital; but that part of it only which he would\notherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money for\nanswering occasional demands.

Bythisattention,besidessavingalmostentirelythe\nextraordinaryexpenseofreplenishingtheircoffers,theygainedtwoother\nveryconsiderableadvantages.\n714 [62] First,bythisattentiontheywereenabledtomakesometolerablejudg-\nment concerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors,\nwithoutbeingobligedtolookoutforanyotherevidencebesideswhattheir\nown books afforded them; men being for the most part either regular or\nirregularintheirrepayments,accordingastheircircumstancesareeither\nthriving or declining. A private man who lends out his money to perhaps\nhalf a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either by himself or his agents,\nobserve and inquire both constantly and carefully into the conduct and G.ed.p306\nsituation of each of them. But a banking company, which lends money to\n237", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nperhaps five hundred different people, and of which the attention is con-\ntinually occupied by objects of a very different kind, can have no regular\ninformationconcerningtheconductandcircumstancesofthegreaterpart\nof its debtors beyond what its own books afford it. In requiring frequent\nand regular repayments from all their customers, the banking companies\nofScotlandhadprobablythisadvantageinview.\n715 [63] Secondly, by this attention they secured themselves from the possibil-\nity of issuing more paper money than what the circulation of the country\ncould easily absorb and employ. When they observed that within moder-\nate periods of time the repayments of a particular customer were upon\nmost occasions fully equal to the advances which they had made to him,\nthey might be assured that the paper money which they had advanced to\nhim had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which\nhe would otherwise have been obliged to keep by him for answering occa-\nsionaldemands;andthat,consequently,thepapermoney,whichtheyhad\ncirculatedbyhismeans,hadnotatanytimeexceededthequantityofgold\nand silver which would have circulated in the country had there been no\npaper money. The frequency, regularity, and amount of his repayments\nwould sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their advances had at\nno time exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwise have\nbeen obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answer-\ning occasional demands; that is, for the purpose of keeping the rest of his\ncapital in constant employment. It is this part of his capital only which,\nwithinmoderateperiodsoftime,iscontinuallyreturningtoeverydealerin\ntheshapeofmoney,whetherpaperorcoin,andcontinuallygoingfromhim\nin the same shape. If the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded\nthis part of his capital, the ordinary amount of his repayments could not,\nwithin moderate periods of time, have equalled the ordinary amount of\nits advances. The stream which, by means of his dealings, was continu-\nallyrunningintothecoffersofthebank, couldnothavebeenequaltothe\nstreamwhich,bymeansofthesamedealings,wascontinuallyrunningout.\nTheadvancesofthebankpaper,byexceedingthequantityofgoldandsil-\nverwhich,hadtherebeennosuchadvances,hewouldhavebeenobligedto\nkeepbyhimforansweringoccasionaldemands,mightsooncometoexceed\nthewholequantityofgoldandsilverwhich(thecommercebeingsupposed\nthe same) would have circulated in the country had there been no paper\nmoney; and consequently to exceed the quantity which the circulation of\nthe country could easily absorb and employ; and the excess of this paper\nmoneywouldimmediatelyhavereturneduponthebankinordertobeex-\nchanged for gold and silver. This second advantage, though equally real,\nwasnotperhapssowellunderstoodbyallthedifferentbankingcompanies\nofScotlandasthefirst.\n716 [64] When,partlybytheconveniencyofdiscountingbills,andpartlybythat G.ed.p307\nof cash accounts, the creditable traders of any country can be dispensed\nfromthenecessityofkeepinganypartoftheirstockbythemunemployed\n238", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nand in ready money for answering occasional demands, they can reason-\nablyexpectnofartherassistancefrombanksandbankers,who,whenthey\nhavegonethusfar,cannot,consistentlywiththeirowninterestandsafety,\ngo farther. A bank cannot, consistently with its own interest, advance to\na trader the whole or even the greater part of the circulating capital with\nwhich he trades; because, though that capital is continually returning to\nhim in the shape of money, and going from him in the same shape, yet\nthe whole of the returns is too distant from the whole of the outgoings,\nand the sum of his repayments could not equal the sum of its advances\nwithin such moderate periods of time as suit the conveniency of a bank.\nStill less, could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his\nfixed capital; of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge, for ex-\nample, employs in erecting his forge and smelting-house, his workhouses\nand warehouses, the dwelling-houses of his workmen, etc.; of the capital\nwhich the undertaker of a mine employs in sinking his shafts, in erecting\nenginesfordrawingoutthewater,inmakingroadsandwaggon-ways,etc.;\nofthecapitalwhichthepersonwhoundertakestoimprovelandemploysin\nclearing, draining, enclosing, manuring, and ploughing waste and uncul-\ntivatedfields,inbuildingfarm-houses,withalltheirnecessaryappendages\nofstables,granaries,etc. Thereturnsofthefixedcapitalareinalmostall\ncasesmuchslowerthanthoseofthecirculatingcapital;andsuchexpenses,\nevenwhenlaidoutwiththegreatestprudenceandjudgment,veryseldom\nreturn to the undertaker till after a period of many years, a period by far\ntoo distant to suit the conveniency of a bank.

Abank,indeed,which\nlendsitsmoneywithouttheexpenseofstampedpaper,orofattorneys\u2019fees\nfor drawing bonds and mortgages, and which accepts of repayment upon G.ed.p308\nthe easy terms of the banking companies of Scotland, would, no doubt,\nbe a very convenient creditor to such traders and undertakers. But such\ntraders and undertakers would, surely, be most inconvenient debtors to\nsuchabank.\n717 [65] It is now more than five-and-twenty years since the paper money is-\nsued by the different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal, or\n239", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nratherwassomewhatmorethanfullyequal,towhatthecirculationofthe\ncountry could easily absorb and employ.

The greater part\nof this paper was, consequently, over and above the value of the gold and\nsilver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no pa-\nper money.

When a banker had even made\nthis discovery, he might sometimes make it too late, and might find that\nhehadalreadydiscountedthebillsofthoseprojectorstosogreatanextent\nthat, by refusing to discount any more, he would necessarily make them\nallbankrupts,andthus,byruiningthem,mightperhapsruinhimself.

Theirowndistress,ofwhichthisprudent\nandnecessaryreserveofthebankswas,nodoubt,theimmediateoccasion,\nthey called the distress of the country; and this distress of the country,\nthey said, was altogether owing to the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad\nconduct of the banks, which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to the\nspirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to beau-\ntify, improve, and enrich the country. It was the duty of the banks, they\nseemed to think, to lend for as long a time, and to as great an extent as\nthey might wish to borrow. The banks, however, by refusing in this man-\nner to give more credit to those to whom they had already given a great\ndeal too much, took the only method by which it was now possible to save\neithertheirowncreditorthepubliccreditofthecountry.\n725 [73] In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established G.ed.p313\nin Scotland for the express purpose of relieving the distress of the coun-\ntry. The design was generous; but the execution was imprudent, and the\nnature and causes of the distress which it meant to relieve were not, per-\nhaps,wellunderstood. Thisbankwasmoreliberalthananyotherhadever\nbeen,bothingrantingcashaccounts,andindiscountingbillsofexchange.\nWith regard to the latter, it seems to have made scarce any distinction\nbetween real and circulating bills, but to have discounted all equally.

To promote such improvements was even said to be the\nchiefofthepublic-spiritedpurposesforwhichitwasinstituted. Byitslib-\nerality in granting cash accounts, and in discounting bills of exchange, it,\nno doubt, issued great quantities of its bank notes. But those bank notes\nbeing,thegreaterpartofthem,overandabovewhatthecirculationofthe\ncountry could easily absorb and employ, returned upon it, in order to be\nexchangedforgoldandsilverasfastastheywereissued.

Its coffers having been filled\n244", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nso very ill, it is said to have been driven to this resource within a very\nfew months after it began to do business. The estates of the proprietors\nof this bank were worth several millions, and by their subscription to the\noriginalbondorcontractofthebank,werereallypledgedforansweringall\nitsengagements.

This bank, therefore, had,\nin little more than the course of two years, advanced to different people\nupwards of eight hundred thousand pounds at five per cent. Upon the\ntwo hundred thousand pounds which it circulated in bank notes, this five\nper cent might, perhaps, be considered as clear gain, without any other\ndeduction besides the expense of management. But upon upwards of six\nhundredthousandpounds,forwhichitwascontinuallydrawingbillsofex-\nchangeuponLondon,itwaspaying,inthewayofinterestandcommission,\nupwards of eight per cent, and was consequently losing more than three\npercentuponmorethanthree-fourthsofallitsdealings.\n726 [74] Theoperationsofthisbankseemtohaveproducedeffectsquiteoppos-\nite to those which were intended by the particular persons who planned\nanddirectedit.

This bank, no\ndoubt, gave some temporary relief to those projectors, and enabled them\ntocarryontheirprojectsforabouttwoyearslongerthantheycouldother-\nwise have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get so much deeper\ninto debt, so that, when ruin came, it fell so much the heavier both upon\nthem and upon their creditors. The operations of this bank, therefore, in-\nsteadofrelieving,inrealityaggravatedinthelong-runthedistresswhich\nthose projectors had brought both upon themselves and upon their coun-\ntry. It would have been much better for themselves, their creditors, and\ntheir country, had the greater part of them been obliged to stop two years\nsooner than they actually did. The temporary relief, however, which this\nbank afforded to those projectors, proved a real and permanent relief to\nthe other Scotch banks. All the dealers in circulating bills of exchange,\nwhich those other banks had become so backward in discounting, had re-\ncoursetothisnewbank,wheretheywerereceivedwithopenarms. Those\nother banks, therefore, were enabled to get very easily out of that fatal\n245", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncircle, from which they could not otherwise have disengaged themselves\nwithout incurring a considerable loss, and perhaps too even some degree\nofdiscredit.\n727 [75] Inthelong-run,therefore,theoperationsofthisbankincreasedthereal\ndistress of the country which it meant to relieve; and effectually relieved\nfromaverygreatdistressthoserivalswhomitmeanttosupplant.\n728 [76] At the first setting out of this bank, it was the opinion of some people\nthat how fast soever its coffers might be emptied, it might easily replen-\nish them by raising money upon the securities of those to whom it had\nadvanced its paper. Experience, I believe, soon convinced them that this\nmethod of raising money was by much too slow to answer their purpose;\nandthatcofferswhichoriginallyweresoillfilled,andwhichemptiedthem-\nselvessoveryfast,couldbereplenishedbynootherexpedientbuttheruin-\nousoneofdrawingbillsuponLondon,andwhentheybecamedue,paying\nthem by other drafts upon the same place with accumulated interest and G.ed.p316\ncommission.

They\ncould still have made nothing by the interest of the paper, which, being\nover and above what the circulation of the country could absorb and em-\nploy, returned upon them, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, as\nfastastheyissuedit; andforthepaymentofwhichtheywerethemselves\ncontinuallyobligedtoborrowmoney.

This operation could not augment in the smal-\nlest degree the quantity of money to be lent. It could only have erected\nthis bank into a sort of general loan office for the whole country. Those\nwho wanted to borrow must have applied to this bank instead of apply-\ning to the private persons who had lent it their money. But a bank which\nlends money perhaps to five hundred different people, the greater part of\nwhom its directors can know very little about, is not likely to be more ju-\n246", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndicious in the choice of its debtors than a private person who lends out\nhis money among a few people whom he knows, and in whose sober and\nfrugal conduct he thinks he has good reason to confide.

The\nsoberandfrugaldebtorsofprivatepersons,onthecontrary,wouldbemore\nlikely to employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were G.ed.p317\nproportioned to their capitals, and which, though they might have less of\nthe grand and the marvellous, would have more of the solid and the prof-\nitable, which would repay with a large profit whatever had been laid out\nupon them, and which would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a\nmuchgreaterquantityoflabourthanthatwhichhadbeenemployedabout\nthem. The success of this operation, therefore, without increasing in the\nsmallest degree the capital of the country, would only have transferred a\ngreatpartofitfromprudentandprofitabletoimprudentandunprofitable\nundertakings.\n730 [78] That the industry of Scotland languished for want of money to employ\nit was the opinion of the famous Mr. Law. By establishing a bank of a\nparticular kind, which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to\ntheamountofthewholevalueofallthelandsinthecountry,heproposed\nto remedy this want of money. The Parliament of Scotland, when he first\nproposedhisproject,didnotthinkpropertoadoptit. Itwasafterwardsad-\nopted, with some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at that time Regent\nof France. The idea of the possibility of multiplying paper to almost any\nextent was the real foundation of what is called the Mississippi scheme,\nthe most extravagant project both of banking and stock-jobbing that, per-\nhaps, the world ever saw. The different operations of this scheme are ex-\nplained so fully, so clearly, and with so much order and distinctness, by\nMr. Du Verney, in his Examination of the Political Reflections upon Com-\nmerce and Finances of Mr. Du Tot, that I shall not give any account of\nthem. TheprinciplesuponwhichitwasfoundedareexplainedbyMr.Law\nhimself, in a discourse concerning money and trade, which he published\ninScotlandwhenhefirstproposedhisproject. Thesplendidbutvisionary\nideaswhicharesetforthinthatandsomeotherworksuponthesameprin-\nciples still continue to make an impression upon many people, and have,\nperhaps, in part, contributed to that excess of banking which has of late G.ed.p318\nbeencomplainedofbothinScotlandandinotherplaces.\n731 [79] The Bank of England is the greatest bank of circulation in Europe. It\nwasincorporated,inpursuanceofanactofParliament,byacharterunder\n247", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe Great Seal, dated the 27th of July, 1694. It at that time advanced to\ngovernment the sum of one million two hundred thousand pounds, for an\nannuity of one hundred thousand pounds; or for 96,000l. a year interest,\nattherateofeightpercent,and4.000l.ayearfortheexpenseofmanage-\nment. The credit of the new government, established by the Revolution,\nwemaybelieve,musthavebeenverylow,whenitwasobligedtoborrowat\nsohighaninterest.\n732 [80] In 1697 the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock by an en-\ngraftmentof1,001,171l.10s.Itswholecapitalstocktherefore,amountedat\nthis time to 2,201,171l.10s. This engraftment is said to have been for the\nsupport of public credit. In 1696, tallies had been at forty, and fifty, and\nsixty per cent discount, and bank notes at twenty per cent3. During the\ngreatrecoinageofthesilver,whichwasgoingonatthistime,thebankhad\nthought proper to discontinue the payment of its notes, which necessarily\noccasionedtheirdiscredit.\n733 [81] In pursuance of the 7th Anne, c.vii., the bank advanced and paid into\nthe exchequer the sum of 400,000l.; making in all the sum of 1,600,000l.\nwhich it had advanced upon its original annuity of 96,000l. interest and\n4,000l. for expense of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of gov- G.ed.p319\nernmentwasasgoodasthatofprivatepersons,sinceitcouldborrowatsix\npercentinterestthecommonlegalandmarketrateofthosetimes. Inpur-\nsuance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the amount\nof 1,775,027l.17s.101d. at six per cent interest, and was at the same time\n2\nallowed to take in subscriptions for doubling its capital. In 1708, there-\nfore, the capital of the bank amounted to 4,402,343l.; and it had advanced\ntogovernmentthesumof3,375,027l.17s.101d.\n2\n734 [82] By a call of fifteen per cent in 1709, there was paid in and made stock\n656,204l.1s.9d.; and by another of ten per cent in 1710, 501,448l.12s.11d.\nInconsequenceofthosetwocalls,therefore,thebankcapitalamountedto\n5,559,995l.14s.8d.\n735 [83] In pursuance of the 3rd George I, c.8, the bank delivered up two mil-\nlions of exchequer bills to be cancelled.

At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced\nto the public 9,375,027l.17s.101d.; and its capital stock amounted only to\n2\n8,959,995l.14s.8d. It was upon this occasion that the sum which the bank\nhad advanced to the public, and for which it received interest, began first\nto exceed its capital stock, or the sum for which it paid a dividend to the\nproprietors of bank stock; or, in other words, that the bank began to have\nan undivided capital, over and above its divided one. It has continued\n3[Smith]JamesPostlethwaite\u2019sHistoryofthePublickRevenue,page301.\n248", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since.

All that it has advanced to the public must be lost before its\ncreditorscansustainanyloss. NootherbankingcompanyinEnglandcan\nbe established by act of Parliament, or can consist of more than six mem-\nbers. It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state.\nIt receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to\nthe creditors of the public, it circulates exchequer bills, and it advances\nto government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are\nfrequently not paid up till some years thereafter.

Itlike-\nwisediscountsmerchants\u2019bills,andhas,uponseveraldifferentoccasions,\nsupported the credit of the principal houses, not only of England, but of\nHamburg and Holland. Upon one occasion, in 1763, it is said to have ad-\nvanced for this purpose, in one week, about 1,600,000l.; a great part of it\nin bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either the greatness of\nthe sum, or the shortness of the time. Upon other occasions, this great\ncompanyhasbeenreducedtothenecessityofpayinginsixpences.\n738 [86] It is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a\ngreaterpartofthatcapitalactiveandproductivethanwouldotherwisebe\nso,thatthemostjudiciousoperationsofbankingcanincreasetheindustry\nofthecountry.

The judicious operations of\nbanking enable him to convert this dead stock into active and productive\nstock; into materials to work upon, into tools to work with, and into pro-\nvisions and subsistence to work for; into stock which produces something\nboth to himself and to his country. The gold and silver money which cir-\nculatesinanycountry, andbymeansofwhichtheproduceofitslandand\nlabour is annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers, is,\n249", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ninthesamemannerasthereadymoneyofthedealer,alldeadstock. Itis\na very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing G.ed.p321\ntothecountry. Thejudiciousoperationsofbanking,bysubstitutingpaper\nin the room of a great part of this gold and silver, enables the country to\nconvert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock;\ninto stock which produces something to the country. The gold and silver\nmoney which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to\na highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass\nand corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either. The ju-\ndicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent\na metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to\nconvert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pastures and\ncorn-fields, and thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce\nofitslandandlabour.

Though the same\npieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed sometimes\nin the one circulation and sometimes in the other, yet as both are con-\nstantly going on at the same time, each requires a certain stock of money\nof one kind or another to carry it on. The value of the goods circulated\nbetween the different dealers, never can exceed the value of those circu-\n250", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlated between the dealers and the consumers; whatever is bought by the\ndealers, being ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers. The circu-\nlationbetweenthedealers,asitiscarriedonbywholesale,requiresgener-\nallyaprettylargesumforeveryparticulartransaction. Thatbetweenthe\ndealersandtheconsumers,onthecontrary,asitisgenerallycarriedonby\nretail, frequently requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a half-\npenny, being often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster than\nlargeones. Ashillingchangesmastersmorefrequentlythanaguinea,and\nahalfpennymorefrequentlythanashilling. Thoughtheannualpurchases\nof all the consumers, therefore, are at least equal in value to those of all\nthe dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much smaller quant-\nity of money; the same pieces, by a more rapid circulation, serving as the\ninstrumentofmanymorepurchasesoftheonekindthanoftheother.\n741 [89] Paper money may be so regulated as either to confine itself very much\ntothecirculationbetweenthedifferentdealers,ortoextenditselflikewise\nto a great part of that between the dealers and the consumers. Where no\nbank notes are circulated under ten pounds value, as in London, paper\nmoney confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers.\nWhen a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer, he is\ngenerally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has occasion to\npurchase five shillings\u2019 worth of goods, so that it often returns into the\nhands of a dealer before the consumer has spent the fortieth part of the\nmoney. Wherebanknotesareissuedforsosmallsumsastwentyshillings,\nas in Scotland, paper money extends itself to a considerable part of the\ncirculationbetweendealersandconsumers. BeforetheActofParliament,\nwhichputastoptothecirculationoftenandfiveshillingnotes, itfilleda\nstill greater part of that circulation.

They are said, likewise, to\nhavebeenmoreabundantbeforetheinstitutionofthosecurrencies.\n745 [93] Thoughpapermoneyshouldbeprettymuchconfinedtothecirculation\nbetween dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might still be able\nto give nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the\ncountry as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole cir-\nculation. The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for\nanswering occasional demands, is destined altogether for the circulation\nbetween himself and other dealers of whom he buys goods. He has no\noccasion to keep any by him for the circulation between himself and the\nconsumers, who are his customers, and who bring ready money to him,\ninstead of taking any from him. Though no paper money, therefore, was\nallowed to be issued but for such sums as would confine it pretty much\nto the circulation between dealers and dealers, yet, partly by discounting G.ed.p324\nreal bills of exchange, and partly by lending upon cash accounts, banks\nandbankersmightstillbeabletorelievethegreaterpartofthosedealers\nfromthenecessityofkeepinganyconsiderablepartoftheirstockbythem,\nunemployedandinreadymoney,foransweringoccasionaldemands.

But\nthose exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might\nendangerthesecurityofthewholesociety,are,andoughttobe,restrained\nby the laws of all governments, of the most free as well as of the most\ndespotical. The obligation of building party walls, in order to prevent the\n252", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncommunication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty exactly of the same\nkindwiththeregulationsofthebankingtradewhicharehereproposed.\n747 [95] Apapermoneyconsistinginbanknotes,issuedbypeopleofundoubted\ncredit, payable upon demand without any condition, and in fact always\nreadily paid as soon as presented, is, in every respect, equal in value to\ngoldandsilvermoney;sincegoldandsilvermoneycanatanytimebehad\nfor it. Whatever is either bought or sold for such paper must necessarily\nbeboughtorsoldascheapasitcouldhavebeenforgoldandsilver.\n748 [96] The increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the\nquantity, and consequently diminishing the value of the whole currency,\nnecessarily augments the money price of commodities. But as the quant-\nity of gold and silver, which is taken from the currency, is always equal\nto the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does not ne-\ncessarilyincreasethequantityofthewholecurrency. Fromthebeginning\nof the last century to the present time, provisions never were cheaper in\nScotland than in 1759, though, from the circulation of ten and five shil-\nling bank notes, there was then more paper money in the country than\natpresent.

Cornis,uponmostoccasions,fullyascheapin\nEnglandasinFrance;thoughthereisagreatdealofpapermoneyinEng- G.ed.p325\nland, and scarce any in France. In 1751 and in 1752, when Mr. Hume\npublished hisPolitical Discourses, and soon after the greatmultiplication\nof paper money in Scotland, there was a very sensible rise in the price of\nprovisions, owing, probably, to the badness of the seasons, and not to the\nmultiplicationofpapermoney.\n749 [97] Itwouldbeotherwise,indeed,withapapermoneyconsistinginpromis-\nsory notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any respect,\neither upon the good will of those who issued them, or upon a condition\nwhichtheholderofthenotesmightnotalwayshaveitinhispowertoful-\nfil; orofwhichthepaymentwasnotexigibletillafteracertainnumberof\nyears, and which in the meantime bore no interest. Such a paper money\nwould, no doubt, fall more or less below the value of gold and silver, ac-\ncording as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate payment\nwas supposed to be greater or less; or according to the greater or less dis-\ntanceoftimeatwhichpaymentwasexigible.\n750 [98] SomeyearsagothedifferentbankingcompaniesofScotlandwereinthe\npractice of inserting into their bank notes, what they called an Optional\nClause, by which they promised payment to the bearer, either as soon as\nthenoteshouldbepresented,or,intheoptionofthedirectors,sixmonths\nafter such presentment, together with the legal interest for the said six\nmonths. The directors of some of those banks sometimes took advantage\nof this optional clause, and sometimes threatened those who demanded\ngold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their notes that\nthey Would take advantage of it, unless such demanders would content\n253", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthemselves with a part of what they demanded. The promissory notes\nof those banking companies constituted at that time the far greater part\nofthecurrencyofScotland,whichthisuncertaintyofpaymentnecessarily\ndegradedbelowthevalueofgoldandsilvermoney. Duringthecontinuance\nof this abuse (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the G.ed.p326\nexchange between London and Carlisle was at par, that between London\nandDumfrieswouldsometimesbefourpercentagainstDumfries,though\nthis town is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle. But at Carlisle, bills\nwerepaidingoldandsilver;whereasatDumfriestheywerepaidinScotch\nbanknotes,andtheuncertaintyofgettingthosebanknotesexchangedfor\ngoldandsilvercoinhadthusdegradedthemfourpercentbelowthevalue\nof that coin. The same Act of Parliament which suppressed ten and five\nshilling bank notes suppressed likewise this optional clause, and thereby\nrestored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural rate,\nortowhatthecourseoftradeandremittancesmighthappentomakeit.\n751 [99] In the paper currencies of Yorkshire, the payment of so small a sum\nas a sixpence sometimes depended upon the condition that the holder of\nthe note should bring the change of a guinea to the person who issued it;\na condition which the holders of such notes might frequently find it very\ndifficult to fulfil, and which must have degraded this currency below the\nvalueofgoldandsilvermoney. AnActofParliamentaccordinglydeclared\nallsuchclausesunlawful,andsuppressed,inthesamemannerasinScot-\nland, all promissory notes, payable to the bearer, under twenty shillings\nvalue.\n752 [100] The paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes\npayable to the bearer on demand, but in government paper, of which the\npaymentwasnotexigibletillseveralyearsafteritwasissued;andthough\nthe colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper, they\ndeclaredittobe,andinfactrenderedit,alegaltenderofpaymentforthe\nfull value for which it was issued. But allowing the colony security to be\nperfectlygood,ahundredpoundspayablefifteenyearshence,forexample,\nin a country where interest at six per cent, is worth little more than forty\npounds ready money. To oblige a creditor, therefore, to accept of this as\nfull payment for a debt of a hundred pounds actually paid down in ready\nmoney was an act of such violent injustice as has scarce, perhaps, been\nattempted by the government of any other country which pretended to be\nfree. It bears the evident marks of having originally been, what the hon-\nest and downright Doctor Douglas assures us it was, a scheme of fraud-\nulent debtors to cheat their creditors. The government of Pennsylvania,\nindeed, pretended, upon their first emission of paper money, in 1722, to\nrender their paper of equal value with gold and silver by enacting penal- G.ed.p327\nties against all those who made any difference in the price of their goods\nwhentheysoldthemforacolonypaper,andwhentheysoldthemforgold\nand silver; a regulation equally tyrannical, but much less effectual than\nthat which it was meant to support. A positive law may render a shil-\n254", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nling a legal tender for guinea, because it may direct the courts of justice\nto discharge the debtor who has made that tender. But no positive law\ncan oblige a person who sells goods, and who is at liberty to sell or not to\nsell as he pleases, to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea in the\nprice of them. Notwithstanding any regulation of this kind, it appeared\nbythecourseofexchangewithGreatBritain,thatahundredpoundsster-\nling was occasionally considered as equivalent, in some of the colonies, to\na hundred and thirty pounds, and in others to so great a sum as eleven\nhundredpoundscurrency;thisdifferenceinthevaluearisingfromthedif-\nferenceinthequantityofpaperemittedinthedifferentcolonies,andinthe\ndistanceandprobabilityofthetermofitsfinaldischargeandredemption.\n753 [101] No law, therefore, could be more equitable than the Act of Parliament,\nso unjustly complained of in the colonies, which declared that no paper\ncurrency to be emitted there in time coming should be a legal tender of\npayment.\n754 [102] Pennsylvania was always more moderate in its emissions of paper\nmoney than any other of our colonies. Its paper currency, accordingly, is\nsaid never to have sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was\ncurrent in the colony before the first emission of its paper money. Before\nthatemission,thecolonyhadraisedthedenominationofitscoin,andhad,\nby act of assembly, ordered five shillings sterling to pass in the colony for\nsixandthreepence,andafterwardsforsixandeightpence. Apoundcolony\ncurrency,therefore,evenwhenthatcurrencywasgoldandsilver,wasmore\nthanthirtypercentbelowthevalueofapoundsterling,andwhenthatcur-\nrencywasturnedintopaperitwasseldommuchmorethanthirtypercent\nbelow that value.

But the mainten-\nanceofamenialservantneverisrestored. Amangrowsrichbyemploying\na multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude\nof menial servants. The labour of the latter, however, has its value, and\ndeserves its reward as well as that of the former. But the labour of the\nmanufacturer fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject or vend-\niblecommodity,whichlastsforsometimeatleastafterthatlabourispast.\nIt is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up to be\nemployed, if necessary, upon some other occasion. That subject, or what\nis the same thing, the price of that subject, can afterwards, if necessary,\nput into motion a quantity of labour equal to that which had originally\nproduced it. The labour of the menial servant, on the contrary, does not\nfix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible commodity.

This produce, how great soever, can never be\ninfinite, but must have certain limits.

One of them, and frequently the\nlargest, is, in the first place, destined for replacing a capital, or for re-\nnewingtheprovisions,materials,andfinishedwork,whichhadbeenwith-\ndrawn from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue either to the\nownerofthiscapital,astheprofitofhisstock,ortosomeotherperson,as\nthe rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of land, one part replaces the\ncapital of the farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent of the land-\nlord; and thus constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this capital, as\nthe profits of his stock; and to some other person, as the rent of his land.\nOftheproduceofagreatmanufactory,inthesamemanner,onepart,and\nthatalwaysthelargest,replacesthecapitaloftheundertakerofthework;\nthe other pays his profit, and thus constitutes a revenue to the owner of\nthiscapital.\n259", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n763 [5] That part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any country\nwhich replaces a capital never is immediately employed to maintain any\nbut productive hands. It pays the wages of productive labour only. That\nwhich is immediately destined for constituting a revenue, either as profit\nor as rent, may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive\nhands.\n764 [6] Whatever part of his stock a man employs as a capital, he always ex-\npects is to be replaced to him with a profit. He employs it, therefore, in\nmaintaining productive bands only; and after having served in the func-\ntion of a capital to him, it constitutes a revenue to them. Whenever he\nemploys any part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind,\nthatpartis,fromthatmoment,withdrawnfromhiscapital,andplacedin\nhisstockreservedforimmediateconsumption.\n765 [7] Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all G.ed.p333\nmaintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual produce\nwhich is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular\npersons, either as the rent of land or as the profits of stock; or, secondly,\nby that part which, though originally destined for replacing a capital and\nfor maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it comes into their\nhands whatever part of it is over and above their necessary subsistence\nmaybeemployedinmaintainingindifferentlyeitherproductiveorunpro-\nductive hands.

The\nworkmanmusthaveearnedhiswagesbyworkdonebeforehecanemploy\nany part of them in this manner. That part, too, is generally but a small\none.

Therichmerchant, thoughwith\nhis capital he maintains industrious people only, yet by his expense, that\n260", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis, by the employment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same\nsortasthegreatlord.\n766 [8] The proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive\nhands, depends very much in every country upon the proportion between G.ed.p334\nthat part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from\nthe ground or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for\nreplacing a capital, and that which is destined for constituting a revenue,\neither as rent or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from\nwhatitisinpoorcountries.\n767 [9] Thus, at present, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large, fre-\nquentlythelargestportionoftheproduceofthelandisdestinedforrepla-\ncing the capital of the rich and independent farmer; the other for paying\nhis profits and the rent of the landlord. But anciently, during the preval-\nency of the feudal government, a very small portion of the produce was\nsufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation. It consisted com-\nmonlyinafewwretchedcattle,maintainedaltogetherbythespontaneous\nproduceofuncultivatedland,andwhichmight,therefore,beconsideredas\napartofthatspontaneousproduce. Itgenerally,too,belongedtotheland-\nlord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the land. All the rest\nof the produce properly belonged to him too, either as rent for his land,\nor as profit upon this paltry capital. The occupiers of land were generally\nbondmen,whosepersonsandeffectswereequallyhisproperty. Thosewho\nwere not bondmen were tenants at will, and though the rent which they\npaid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it really amounted\nto the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all times command\ntheir labour in peace and their service in war. Though they lived at a\ndistancefromhishouse,theywereequallydependentuponhimashisre-\ntainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land undoubtedly\nbelongstohimwhocandisposeofthelabourandserviceofallthosewhom\nit maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of the landlord\nseldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce\nof the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved parts of the\ncountry, has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient times; and\nthis third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it seems, three or four\ntimesgreaterthanthewholehadbeenbefore. Intheprogressofimprove-\nment, rent, though it increases in proportion to the extent, diminishes in\nproportiontotheproduceoftheland.\n768 [10] In the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at present em-\nployed in trade and manufactures. In the ancient state, the little trade\nthatwasstirring,andthefewhomelyandcoarsemanufacturesthatwere\ncarried on, required but very small capitals. These, however, must have\nyielded very large profits. The rate of interest was nowhere less than ten\nper cent, and their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great G.ed.p335\ninterest. At present the rate of interest, in the improved parts of Europe,\nis nowhere higher than six per cent, and in some of the most improved it\n261", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis so low as four, three, and two per cent. Though that part of the rev-\nenueoftheinhabitantswhichisderivedfromtheprofitsofstockisalways\nmuchgreaterinrichthaninpoorcountries,itisbecausethestockismuch\ngreater: inproportiontothestocktheprofitsaregenerallymuchless.\n769 [11] That part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as soon as it comes\neither from the ground or from the hands of the productive labourers, is\ndestined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich than in\npoor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that which is im-\nmediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as profit.\nThe funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour are not only\nmuchgreaterintheformerthaninthelatter,butbearamuchgreaterpro-\nportion to those which, though they may be employed to maintain either\nproductive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for the\nlatter.\n770 [12] The proportion between those different funds necessarily determines\nin every country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry\nor idleness. We are more industrious than our forefathers; because in\nthe present times the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are\nmuchgreaterinproportiontothosewhicharelikelytobeemployedinthe\nmaintenance of idleness than they were two or three centuries ago. Our\nancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry.\nIt is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing than to work for noth-\ning. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the inferior ranks of\npeople are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital, they are in\ngeneral industrious, sober, and thriving; as in many English, and in most\nDutch towns. In those towns which are principally supported by the con-\nstant or occasional residence of a court, and in which the inferior ranks\nof people are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue, they are in\ngeneral idle, dissolute, and poor; as at Rome, Versailles, Compiegne, and\nFontainebleu. If you except Rouen and Bordeaux, there is little trade or\nindustry in any of the parliament towns of France; and the inferior ranks\nof people, being elderly maintained by the expense of the members of the\ncourts of justice, and of those who come to plead before them, are in gen-\neral idle and poor. The great trade of Rouen and Bordeaux seems to be\naltogether the effect of their situation. Rouen is necessarily the entrepot\nofalmostallthegoodswhicharebroughteitherfromforeigncountries,or\nfrom the maritime provinces of France, for the consumption of the great G.ed.p336\ncity of Paris. Bordeaux is in the same manner the entrepot of the wines\nwhich grow upon the banks of the Garonne, and of the rivers which run\ninto it, one of the richest wine countries in the world, and which seems\nto produce the wine fittest for exportation, or best suited to the taste of\nforeign nations. Such advantageous situations necessarily attract a great\ncapitalbythegreatemploymentwhichtheyaffordit;andtheemployment\nof this capital is the cause of the industry of those two cities. In the other\nparliamenttownsofFrance,verylittlemorecapitalseemstobeemployed\n262", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthanwhatisnecessaryforsupplyingtheirownconsumption;thatis,little\nmorethanthesmallestcapitalwhichcanbeemployedinthem. Thesame\nthingmaybesaidofParis,Madrid,andVienna. Ofthosethreecities,Paris\nis by far the most industrious; but Paris itself is the principal market of\nallthemanufacturesestablishedatParis,anditsownconsumptionisthe\nprincipal object of all the trade which it carries on. London, Lisbon, and\nCopenhagen, are, perhaps, the only three cities in Europe which are both\nthe constant residence of a court, and can at the same time be considered\nas trading cities, or as cities which trade not only for their own consump-\ntion, but for that of other cities and countries. The situation of all the\nthree is extremely advantageous, and naturally fits them to be the entre-\npots of a great part of the goods destined for the consumption of distant\nplaces. Inacitywhereagreatrevenueisspent,toemploywithadvantage\nacapitalforanyotherpurposethanforsupplyingtheconsumptionofthat\ncity is probably more difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of\npeople have no other maintenance but what they derive from the employ-\nment of such a capital. The idleness of the greater part of the people who\nare maintained by the expense of revenue corrupts, it is probable, the in-\ndustryofthosewhooughttobemaintainedbytheemploymentofcapital,\nand renders it less advantageous to employ a capital there than in other\nplaces. There was little trade or industry in Edinburgh before the union.\nWhen the Scotch Parliament was no longer to be assembled in it, when it\nceased to be the necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry\nofScotland,itbecameacityofsometradeandindustry.

The inhabitants of a large village, it has sometimes been\nobserved, afterhavingmadeconsiderableprogressinmanufactures, have\nbecome idle and poor in consequence of a great lord having taken up his\nresidenceintheirneighbourhood.\n771 [13] The proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems every- G.ed.p337\nwheretoregulatetheproportionbetweenindustryandidleness.

Though, at present, few people, I believe,\ndoubt of this, yet during this period, five years have seldom passed away\ninwhichsomebookorpamphlethasnotbeenpublished,written,too,with\nsuch abilities as to gain some authority with the public, and pretending\nto demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was fast declining, that the\ncountry was depopulated, agriculture neglected, manufactures decaying,\nand trade undone.

Atthis\nperiod, too, we have all reason to believe, the country was much more ad-\nvanced in improvement than it had been about a century before, towards\nthe close of the dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster.\nEven then it was, probably, in a better condition than it had been at the\nNormanConquest,andattheNormanConquestthanduringtheconfusion\noftheSaxonHeptarchy. Evenatthisearlyperiod,itwascertainlyamore\nimprovedcountrythanattheinvasionofJuliusCaesar, whenitsinhabit-\nantswerenearlyinthesamestatewiththesavagesinNorthAmerica.\n793 [35] In each of those periods, however, there was not only much private\nand public profusion, many expensive and unnecessary wars, great per-\nversion of the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain\nunproductivehands;butsometimes,intheconfusionofcivildiscord,such\nabsolute waste and destruction of stock, as might be supposed, not only\nto retard, as it certainly did, the natural accumulation of riches, but to\nhave left the country, at the end of the period, poorer than at the begin-\nning. Thus, in the happiest and most fortunate period of them all, that\nwhich has passed since the Restoration, how many disorders and misfor-\ntunes have occurred, which, could they have been foreseen, not only the\nimpoverishment,butthetotalruinofthecountrywouldhavebeenexpec-\ntedfromthem?

The annual produce of its land and labour\nis, undoubtedly, much greater at present than it was either at the Res-\ntoration or at the Revolution. The capital, therefore, annually employed\nin cultivating this land, and in maintaining this labour, must likewise be\nmuch greater. In the midst of all the exactions of government, this cap-\nital has been silently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality\nand good conduct of individuals, by their universal, continual, and unin-\nterrupted effort to better their own condition. It is this effort, protected\nby law and allowed by liberty to exert itself in the manner that is most\nadvantageous,whichhasmaintainedtheprogressofEnglandtowardsop-\nulenceand improvementin almostall formertimes, andwhich, itis tobe\nhoped, will do so in all future times.

Were two men of equal fortune to spend\ntheir revenue, the one chiefly in the one way, the other in the other, the\nmagnificenceofthepersonwhoseexpensehadbeenchieflyindurablecom-\nmodities, would be continually increasing, every day\u2019s expense contribut-\ning something to support and heighten the effect of that of the following G.ed.p347\nday: that of the other, on the contrary, would be no greater at the end of\ntheperiodthanatthebeginning. Theformer,too,would,attheendofthe\nperiod, be the richer man of the two. He would have a stock of goods of\nsome kind or other, which, though it might not be worth all that it cost,\nwould always be worth something. No trace or vestige of the expense of\nthe latter would remain, and the effects of ten or twenty years profusion\nwouldbeascompletelyannihilatedasiftheyhadneverexisted.\n797 [39] As the one mode of expense is more favourable than the other to the\nopulenceofanindividual,soisitlikewisetothatofanation.

In countries which have long\nbeen rich, you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people in posses-\nsion both of houses and furniture perfectly good and entire, but of which\nneither the one could have been built, nor the other have been made for\ntheir use. What was formerly a seat of the family of Seymour is now an\ninn upon the Bath road.

Noble palaces,\nmagnificent villas, great collections of books, statues, pictures and other\ncuriosities,arefrequentlybothanornamentandanhonour,notonlytothe\nneighbourhood, but to the whole country to which they belong. Versailles\nis an ornament and an honour to France, Stowe and Wilton to England.\nItaly still continues to command some sort of veneration by the number\nof monuments of this kind which it possesses, though the wealth which\n271", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nproduced them has decayed, and though the genius which planned them\nseemstobeextinguished,perhapsfromnothavingthesameemployment.\n798 [40] The expense too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favour-\nable, not only to accumulation, but to frugality.

Even they scarce ever borrow merely to spend.\nWhat they borrow, one may say, is commonly spent before they borrow it.\nThey have generally consumed so great a quantity of goods, advanced to\nthem upon credit by shopkeepers and tradesmen, that they find it neces-", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nsary to borrow at interest in order to pay the debt.

Itis G.ed.p351\nnotproperlyborrowedinordertobespent,butinordertoreplaceacapital\nwhichhadbeenspentbefore.\n804 [4] Almost all loans at interest are made in money, either of paper, or of\ngold and silver. But what the borrower really wants, and what the lender\nreally supplies him with, is not the money, but the money\u2019s worth, or the\ngoods which it can purchase. If he wants it as a stock for immediate con-\nsumption, it is those goods only which he can place in that stock. If he\nwants it as a capital for employing industry, it is from those goods only\nthattheindustriouscanbefurnishedwiththetools,materials,andmain-\ntenance necessary for carrying on their work. By means of the loan, the\nlender, as it were, assigns to the borrower his right to a certain portion of\nthe annual produce of the land and labour of the country to be employed\nastheborrowerpleases.\n805 [5] The quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of\nmoneywhichcanbelentatinterestinanycountry,isnotregulatedbythe\nvalueofthemoney,whetherpaperorcoin,whichservesastheinstrument\nofthedifferentloansmadeinthatcountry,butbythevalueofthatpartof\nthe annual produce which, as soon as it comes either from the ground, or\nfrom the hands of the productive labourers, is destined not only for repla-\ncing a capital, but such a capital as the owner does not care to be at the\ntroubleofemployinghimself. Assuchcapitalsarecommonlylentoutand\npaid back in money, they constitute what is called the monied interest. It\nis distinct, not only from the landed, but from the trading and manufac-\nturing interests, as in these last the owners themselves employ their own\ncapitals. Even in the monied interest, however, the money is, as it were,\nbutthedeedofassignment,whichconveysfromonehandtoanotherthose\ncapitals which the owners do not care to employ themselves. Those capit-\nalsmaybegreaterinalmostanyproportionthantheamountofthemoney\nwhich serves as the instrument of their conveyance; the same pieces of\nmoney successively serving for many different loans, as well as for many\ndifferent purchases. A, for example, lends to W a thousand pounds, with\nwhich W immediately purchases of B a thousand pounds\u2019 worth of goods.\nBhavingnooccasionforthemoneyhimself,lendstheidenticalpiecestoX,\nwithwhichXimmediatelypurchasesofCanotherthousandpounds\u2019worth\nof goods. C in the same manner, and for the same reason, lends them to G.ed.p352\nY, who again purchases goods with them of D. In this manner the same\npieces, either of coin or paper, may in the course of a few days, serve as\nthe instrument of three different loans, and of three different purchases,\neachofwhichis,invalue,equaltothewholeamountofthosepieces. What\nthe three monied men A, B, and C assign to the three borrowers, W, X,\nY, is the power of making those purchases. In this power consist both the\nvalue and the use of the loans. The stock lent by the three monied men\n275", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis equal to the value of the goods which can be purchased with it, and is\nthree times greater than that of the money with which the purchases are\nmade. Those loans however, may be all perfectly well secured, the goods\npurchased by the different debtors being so employed as, in due time, to\nbring back, with a profit, an equal value either of coin or of paper. And\nasthesamepiecesofmoneycanthusserveastheinstrumentofdifferent\nloans to three, or for the same reason, to thirty times their value, so they\nmaylikewisesuccessivelyserveastheinstrumentofrepayment.\n806 [6] A capital lent at interest may, in this manner, be considered as an as-\nsignment from the lender to the borrowers of a certain considerable por-\ntion of the annual produce; upon condition that the borrower in return\nshall, during the continuance of the loan, annually assign to the lender a\nsmaller portion, called the interest; and at the end of it a portion equally\nconsiderable with that which had originally been assigned to him, called\nthe repayment. Though money, either coin or paper, serves generally as\nthe deed of assignment both to the smaller and to the more considerable\nportion,itisitselfaltogetherdifferentfromwhatisassignedbyit.\n807 [7] In proportion as that share of the annual produce which, as soon as\nit comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive la-\nbourers,isdestinedforreplacingacapital,increasesinanycountry,what\nis called the monied interest naturally increases with it. The increase of\nthoseparticularcapitalsfromwhichtheownerswishtoderivearevenue,\nwithout being at the trouble of employing them themselves, naturally ac-\ncompaniesthegeneralincreaseofcapitals; or, inotherwords, asstockin-\ncreases,thequantityofstocktobelentatinterestgrowsgraduallygreater\nandgreater.\n808 [8] Asthequantityofstocktobelentatinterestincreases,theinterest,or\nthe price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily dimin-\nishes, not only from those general causes which make the market price\nof things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from other\ncauses which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals increase in\nanycountry,theprofitswhichcanbemadebyemployingthemnecessarily\ndiminish. It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the G.ed.p353\ncountry a profitable method of employing any new capital.

But when the profits which can be made by the use of a capital\n276", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nare in this manner diminished, as it were, at both ends, the price which\ncan be paid for the use of it, that is, the rate of interest, must necessarily\nbediminishedwiththem.\n809 [9] Mr. Locke, Mr. Law, and Mr. Montesquieu, as well as many other\nwriters, seem to have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold G.ed.p354\nandsilver,inconsequenceofthediscoveryoftheSpanishWestIndies,was\nthe real cause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the greater\npartofEurope. Thosemetals,theysay,havingbecomeoflessvaluethem-\nselves,theuseofanyparticularportionofthemnecessarilybecameofless\nvalue too, and consequently the price which could be paid for it. This no-\ntion, which at first sight seems plausible, has been so fully exposed by\nMr. Hume that it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say anything more about\nit. The following very short and plain argument, however, may serve to\nexplain more distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gen-\ntlemen.\n810 [10] Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent seems to\nhavebeenthecommonrateofinterestthroughthegreaterpartofEurope.\nIt has since that time in different countries sunk to six, five, four, and\nthree per cent. Let us suppose that in every particular country the value\nof silverhas sunkprecisely inthe same proportion as therate ofinterest;\nandthatinthosecountries,forexample,whereinteresthasbeenreduced\nfrom ten to five per cent, the same quantity of silver can now purchase\njusthalfthequantityofgoodswhichitcouldhavepurchasedbefore. This\nsupposition will not, I believe, be found anywhere agreeable to the truth,\nbutitisthemostfavourabletotheopinionwhichwearegoingtoexamine;\nand even upon this supposition it is utterly impossible that the lowering\nofthevalueofsilvercouldhavethesmallesttendencytolowertherateof\ninterest. Ifahundredpoundsareinthosecountriesnowofnomorevalue\nthan fifty pounds were then, ten pounds must now be of no more value G.ed.p355\nthanfivepoundswerethen. Whateverwerethecauseswhichloweredthe\nvalue of the capital, the same must necessarily have lowered that of the\ninterest, and exactly in the same proportion. The proportion between the\nvalueofthecapitalandthatoftheinterestmusthaveremainedthesame,\nthoughtheratehadbeenaltered. Byalteringtherate,onthecontrary,the\nproportion between those two values is necessarily altered. If a hundred\npounds now are worth no more than fifty were then, five pounds now can\nbe worth no more than two pounds ten shillings were then. By reducing\ntherateofinterest,therefore,fromtentofivepercent,wegivefortheuse\nof a capital, which is supposed to be equal to one half of its former value,\nan interest which is equal to one fourth only of the value of the former\ninterest.\n811 [11] Any increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities\ncirculated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect\nthantodiminishthevalueofthatmetal. Thenominalvalueofallsortsof\ngoods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the same\n277", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nas before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of sil-\nver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number\nof people whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely the\nsame. The capital of the country would be the same, though a greater\nnumber of pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of\nit from one hand to another. The deeds of assignment, like the convey-\nances of a verbose attorney, would be more cumbersome, but the thing\nassigned would be precisely the same as before, and could produce only\nthe same effects. The funds for maintaining productive labour being the\nsame, the demand for it would be the same. Its price or wages, there-\nfore, though nominally greater, would really be the same. They would be\npaidinagreaternumberofpiecesofsilver;buttheywouldpurchaseonly\nthe same quantity of goods. The profits of stock would be the same both\nnominallyandreally. Thewagesoflabourarecommonlycomputedbythe\nquantity of silver which is paid to the labourer. When that is increased,\ntherefore, his wages appear to be increased, though they may sometimes\nbe no greater than before. But the profits of stock are not computed by\nthe number of pieces of silver with which they are paid, but by the pro-\nportion which those pieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus in a\nparticular country five shillings a week are said to be the common wages\noflabour,andtenpercentthecommonprofitsofstock. Butthewholecap-\nital of the country being the same as before, the competition between the\ndifferent capitals of individuals into which it was divided would likewise\nbe the same. They would all trade with the same advantages and disad-\nvantages. The common proportion between capital and profit, therefore,\nwouldbethesame,andconsequentlythecommoninterestofmoney;what G.ed.p356\ncan commonly be given for the use of money being necessarily regulated\nbywhatcancommonlybemadebytheuseofit.\n812 [12] Anyincreaseinthequantityofcommoditiesannuallycirculatedwithin\nthe country, while that of the money which circulated them remained the\nsame, would, on the contrary, produce many other important effects, be-\nsides that of raising the value of the money.

The interest of money, keeping pace always\nwith the profits of stock, might, in this manner, be greatly diminished,\nthough the value of money, or the quantity of goods which any particular\nsumcouldpurchase,wasgreatlyaugmented.\n813 [13] In some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law.\nButassomethingcaneverywherebemadebytheuseofmoney,something\nought everywhere to be paid for the use of it.

Sober people, who will give for the use of money no more\nthan a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it, would not\nventure into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country\nwould thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a\nprofitable and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those which were\nmost likely to waste and destroy it.

The superior security of land, together with\nsomeotheradvantageswhichalmosteverywhereattenduponthisspecies\nof property, will generally dispose him to content himself with a smaller\nrevenue from land than what he might have by lending out his money at\ninterest. These advantages are sufficient to compensate a certain differ-\nence of revenue; but they will compensate a certain difference only; and\nif the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a greater\ndifference, nobody would buy land, which would soon reduce its ordinary\nprice.

In the first way are employed the capitals of all those who\nundertake the improvement or cultivation of lands, mines, or fisheries; in\nthe second, those of all master manufacturers; in the third, those of all\nwholesalemerchants;andinthefourth,thoseofallretailers.

Iftherewasnosuchtradeasabutcher,for\nexample, every man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox or a whole\nsheep at a time.

Nothing can be more convenient for such\na person than to be able to purchase his subsistence from day to day, or\neven from hour to hour, as he wants it. He is thereby enabled to employ\nalmost his whole stock as a capital. He is thus enabled to furnish work\nto a greater value, and the profit, which he makes by it in this way, much\nmorethancompensatestheadditionalpricewhichtheprofitoftheretailer\nimposes upon the goods. The prejudices of some political writers against\nshopkeepersandtradesmenarealtogetherwithoutfoundation. Sofarisit\nfrom being necessary either to tax them or to restrict their numbers that\nthey can never be multiplied so as to hurt the public, though they may so\nas to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example, which\ncanbesoldinaparticulartownislimitedbythedemandofthattownand\nits neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed in the\ngrocery trade cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that quantity.\nIf this capital is divided between two different grocers, their competition\nwill tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in the hands\nof one only; and if it were divided among twenty, their competition would\nbe just so much the greater, and the chance of their combining together, G.ed.p362\nin order to raise the price, just so much the less. Their competition might\nperhaps ruin some of themselves; but to take care of this is the business\nof the parties concerned, and it may safely be trusted to their discretion.\nIt can never hurt either the consumer or the producer; on the contrary, it\nmust tend to make the retailers both sell cheaper and buy dearer than if\nthe whole trade was monopolized by one or two persons. Some of them,\nperhaps, may sometimes decoy a weak customer to buy what he has no\noccasion for. This evil, however, is of too little importance to deserve the\npublicattention,norwoulditnecessarilybepreventedbyrestrictingtheir\nnumbers.

Their labour, when properly directed,\nfixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon which\nit is bestowed, and generally adds to its price the value at least of their\nownmaintenanceandconsumption. Theprofitsofthefarmer,oftheman-\nufacturer,ofthemerchant,andretailer,arealldrawnfromthepriceofthe\ngoods which the two first produce, and the two last buy and sell.

It is by this service\nchiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive labour of G.ed.p363\nthe society, and to increase the value of its annual produce.

Part of\nhis circulating capital is employed in purchasing materials, and replaces,\nwiththeirprofits, thecapitalsofthefarmersandminersofwhomhepur-\nchases them.

It may frequently be at a great distance both from the place\nwherethematerialsgrow,andfromthatwherethecompletemanufacture\nis consumed.

Thesailorsorcarrierswhom\nhe employs may still belong indifferently either to his country or to their\ncountry, or to some third country, in the same manner as if he had been\na native.

Itnecessarilyputsintomotionagreaterquant-\nityofproductivelabour,andaddsagreatervaluetotheannualproduceof\nthe land and labour of the society. It may, however, be very useful to the\ncountry, though it should not reside within it. The capitals of the British\nmanufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually imported from\nthe coasts of the Baltic are surely very useful to the countries which pro-\nduce them. Those materials are a part of the surplus produce of those\ncountrieswhich,unlessitwasannuallyexchangedforsomethingwhichis\nin demand there, would be of no value, and would soon cease to be pro-\nduced. Themerchantswhoexportitreplacethecapitalsofthepeoplewho\nproduce it, and thereby encourage them to continue the production; and\ntheBritishmanufacturersreplacethecapitalsofthosemerchants.\n835 [18] A particular country, in the same manner as a particular person, may\nfrequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate all its\nlands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for immedi-\nate use and consumption, and to transport the surplus part either of the\nrude or manufactured produce to those distant markets where it can be\nexchangedforsomethingforwhichthereisademandathome. Theinhab-\nitants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital sufficient\ntoimproveandcultivatealltheirlands. Thewoolofthesoutherncounties\nof Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land carriage through very\nbad roads, manufactured in Yorkshire, for want of capital to manufacture\nit at home. There are many little manufacturing towns in Great Britain, G.ed.p366\nof which the inhabitants have not capital sufficient to transport the pro-\nduceoftheirownindustrytothosedistantmarketswherethereisdemand\n285", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nandconsumptionforit.

After\nagriculture, the capital employed in manufactures puts into motion the\ngreatest quantity of productive labour, and adds the greatest value to the\nannual produce. That which is employed in the trade of exportation has\ntheleasteffectofanyofthethree.\n837 [20] Thecountry,indeed,whichhasnotcapitalsufficientforallthosethree\npurposes has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems\nnaturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely and with an insuf-\nficient capital to do all the three is certainly not the shortest way for a\nsociety, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire a sufficient\none. Thecapitalofalltheindividualsofanationhasitslimitsinthesame\nmannerasthatofasingleindividual,andiscapableofexecutingonlycer-\ntain purposes. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased\nin the same manner as that of a single individual by their continually ac-\ncumulating and adding to it whatever they save out of their revenue. It\nis likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when it is employed in the way\nthat affords the greatest revenue to all the inhabitants of the country, as\ntheywillthusbeenabledtomakethegreatestsavings. Buttherevenueof\nalltheinhabitantsofthecountryisnecessarilyinproportiontothevalue\noftheannualproduceoftheirlandandlabour.\n838 [21] It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American\ncolonies towards wealth and greatness that almost their whole capitals\nhave hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures,\nthosehouseholdandcoursermanufacturesexceptedwhichnecessarilyac-\ncompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the wo-\nmen and children in every private family. The greater part both of the\nexportation and coasting trade of America is carried on by the capitals\nof merchants who reside in Great Britain. Even the stores and ware- G.ed.p367\nhouses from which goods are retailed in some provinces, particularly in\nVirginia and Maryland, belong many of them to merchants who reside in\nthemothercountry, andaffordoneofthefewinstancesoftheretailtrade\nof a society being carried on by the capitals of those who are not resident\nmembersofit. WeretheAmericans,eitherbycombinationorbyanyother\nsort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and,\nbythusgivingamonopolytosuchoftheirowncountrymenascouldman-\nufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital into\nthisemployment,theywouldretardinsteadofacceleratingthefurtherin-\ncrease in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct instead\n286", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof promoting the progress of their country towards real wealth and great-\nness. This would be still more the case were they to attempt, in the same\nmanner,tomonopolizetothemselvestheirwholeexportationtrade.\n839 [22] Thecourseofhumanprosperity,indeed,seemsscarceevertohavebeen\nof so long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital\nsufficient for all those three purposes; unless perhaps, we give credit to\nthe wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of China, of those of\nancientEgypt,andoftheancientstateofIndostan. Eventhosethreecoun-\ntries,thewealthiest,accordingtoallaccounts,thateverwereintheworld,\narechieflyrenownedfortheirsuperiorityinagricultureandmanufactures.\nThey do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade. The ancient\nEgyptians had a superstitious antipathy to the sea; a superstition nearly\nofthesamekindprevailsamongtheIndians;andtheChinesehavenever\nexcelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of the surplus produce of\nallthosethreecountriesseemstohavebeenalwaysexportedbyforeigners,\nwhogaveinexchangeforitsomethingelseforwhichtheyfoundademand\nthere,frequentlygoldandsilver.\n840 [23] It is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion\na greater or smaller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or\nsmallervaluetotheannualproduceofitslandandlabour,accordingtothe G.ed.p368\ndifferentproportionsinwhichitisemployedinagriculture,manufactures,\nand wholesale trade. The difference, too, is very great, according to the\ndifferentsortsofwholesaletradeinwhichanypartofitisemployed.\n841 [24] Allwholesaletrade,allbuyinginordertosellagainbywholesale,may\nbe reduced to three different sorts. The home trade, the foreign trade of\nconsumption,andthecarryingtrade. Thehometradeisemployedinpur-\nchasinginonepartofthesamecountry,andsellinginanother,theproduce\nof the industry of that country. It comprehends both the inland and the\ncoasting trade. The foreign trade of consumption is employed in purchas-\ningforeigngoodsforhomeconsumption. Thecarryingtradeisemployedin\ntransacting the commerce of foreign countries, or in carrying the surplus\nproduceofonetoanother.\n842 [25] The capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the coun-\ntry in order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country,\ngenerally replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals that had\nboth been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country,\nand thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it sends\nout from the residence of the merchant a certain value of commodities,\nit generally brings back in return at least an equal value of other com-\nmodities. When both are the produce of domestic industry, it necessarily\nreplacesbyeverysuchoperationtwodistinctcapitalswhichhadbothbeen\nemployed in supporting productive labour, and thereby enables them to\ncontinue that support. The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to\nLondon, and brings back English corn and manufactures to Edinburgh,\nnecessarily replaces by every such operation, two British capitals which\n287", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nhad both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Bri-\ntain.\n843 [26] The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consump-\ntion, when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry,\nreplacestoo,byeverysuchoperation,twodistinctcapitals;butoneofthem\nonlyisemployedinsupportingdomesticindustry. Thecapitalwhichsends\nBritishgoodstoPortugal,andbringsbackPortuguesegoodstoGreatBri-\ntain, replaces by every such operation only one British capital. The other\nis a Portuguese one. Though the returns, therefore, of the foreign trade\nof consumption should be as quick as those of the home trade, the capital\nemployedinitwillgivebutonehalftheencouragementtotheindustryor\nproductivelabourofthecountry.\n844 [27] Butthereturnsoftheforeigntradeofconsumptionareveryseldomso\nquickasthoseofthehometrade. Thereturnsofthehometradegenerally\ncome in before the end of the year, and sometimes three or four times in\nthe year. The returns of the foreign trade of consumption seldom come\nin before the end of the year, and sometimes not till after two or three\nyears. A capital, therefore, employed in the home trade will sometimes G.ed.p369\nmaketwelveoperations,orbesentoutandreturnedtwelvetimes,beforea\ncapitalemployedintheforeigntradeofconsumptionhasmadeone. Ifthe\ncapitalsareequal,therefore,theonewillgivefour-and-twentytimesmore\nencouragementandsupporttotheindustryofthecountrythantheother.\n845 [28] Theforeigngoodsforhomeconsumptionmaysometimesbepurchased,\nnot with the produce of domestic industry, but with some other foreign\ngoods. These last, however, must have been purchased either immedi-\nately with the produce of domestic industry, or with something else that\nhad been purchased with it; for, the case of war and conquest excepted,\nforeign goods can ever be acquired but in exchange for something that\nhad been produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more dif-\nferent exchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in such a\nroundabout foreign trade of consumption, are, in every respect, the same\nasthoseofoneemployedinthemostdirecttradeofthesamekind,except\nthat the final returns are likely to be still more distant, as they must de-\npend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign trades. If the flax\nand hemp of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of Virginia, which had\nbeen purchased with British manufactures, the merchant must wait for\nthe returns of two distinct foreign trades before he can employ the same\ncapitalinre-purchasingalikequantityofBritishmanufactures.

Whetherthewholecapitalemployed\nin such a round-about trade belong to one merchant or to three can make\nnodifferencewithregardtothecountry,thoughitmaywithregardtothe\nparticular merchants. Three times a greater capital must in both cases\nbeemployedinordertoexchangeacertainvalueofBritishmanufactures\nfor a certain quantity of flax and hemp than would have been necessary\nhad the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly exchanged for G.ed.p370\noneanother. Thewholecapitalemployed,therefore,insucharound-about\nforeign trade of consumption will generally give less encouragement and\nsupport to the productive labour of the country than an equal capital em-\nployedinamoredirecttradeofthesamekind.\n846 [29] Whatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for\nhome consumption are purchased, it can occasion no essential difference\neither in the nature of the trade, or in the encouragement and support\nwhich it can give to the productive labour of the country from which it is\ncarried on. If they are purchased with the gold of Brazil, for example, or\nwith the silver of Peru, this gold and silver, like the tobacco of Virginia,\nmust have been purchased with something that either was the produce\noftheindustryofthecountry,orthathadbeenpurchasedwithsomething\nelsethatwasso. Sofar,therefore,astheproductivelabourofthecountryis\nconcerned,theforeigntradeofconsumptionwhichiscarriedonbymeans\nofgoldandsilverhasalltheadvantagesandalltheinconveniencesofany\nother equally round-about foreign trade of consumption, and will replace\njust as fast or just as slow the capital which is immediately employed in\nsupporting that productive labour. It seems even to have one advantage\nover any other equally roundabout foreign trade. The transportation of\nthosemetalsfromoneplacetoanother,onaccountoftheirsmallbulkand\ngreat value, is less expensive than that of almost any other foreign goods\nofequalvalue. Theirfreightismuchless,andtheirinsurancenotgreater;\nand no goods, besides, are less liable to suffer by the carriage.

England,\nperhapsthesecondrichestcountryofEurope,islikewisesupposedtohave\na considerable share of it; though what commonly passes for the carrying\ntrade of England will frequently, perhaps, be found to be no more than a\nround-about foreign trade of consumption.

Thedifferentquantitiesofproductivelabourwhichitmayputinto\nmotion, and the different values which it may add to the annual, produce\nof the land and labour of the society, according as it is employed in one\nor other of those different ways, never enter into his thoughts.

The profits of agriculture,\nhowever, seem to have no superiority over those of other employments in\nany part of Europe.

Compare the cultivation of the lands in the", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nneighbourhood of any considerable town with that of those which lie at\nsome distance from it, and you will easily satisfy yourself how much the\ncountry is benefited by the commerce of the town.

The rapine and violence which the barbari-\nans exercised against the ancient inhabitants interrupted the commerce\nbetween the towns and the country. The towns were deserted, and the\ncountrywasleftuncultivated,andthewesternprovincesofEurope,which\nhad enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, G.ed.p382\nsunk into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the continu-\nance of those confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of those nations\nacquired or usurped to themselves the greater part of the lands of those\ncountries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them,\nwhether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of\nthemwereengrossed,andthegreaterpartbyafewgreatproprietors.\n865 [2] This original engrossing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might\nhavebeenbutatransitoryevil. Theymightsoonhavebeendividedagain,\nand broke into small parcels either by succession or by alienation. The\nlawofprimogeniturehinderedthemfrombeingdividedbysuccession: the\nintroduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels by\nalienation.\n866 [3] When land, like movables, is considered as the means only of subsist-\nence and enjoyment, the natural law of succession divides it, like them,\namong all the children of the family; of an of whom the subsistence and\nenjoymentmaybesupposedequallydeartothefather. Thisnaturallawof\nsuccession accordingly took place among the Romans, who made no more\ndistinction between elder and younger, between male and female, in the\ninheritanceoflandsthanwedointhedistributionofmovables. Butwhen G.ed.p383\nlandwasconsideredasthemeans,notofsubsistencemerely,butofpower\nand protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to\none. In those disorderly times every great landlord was a sort of petty\nprince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nrespects their legislator in peace, and their leader in war. He made war\naccording to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and\nsometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, there-\nfore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it,\ndepended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose\nevery part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its\nneighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not\nimmediately, indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed\nestates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of\nmonarchies, though not always at their first institution. That the power,\nand consequently the security of the monarchy, may not be weakened by\ndivision, it must descend entire to one of the children.

In the present state of Europe, the proprietor of a single\nacre of land is as perfectly secure of his possession as the proprietor of a G.ed.p384\nhundredthousand. Therightofprimogeniture,however,stillcontinuesto\nberespected, andasofallinstitutionsitisthefittesttosupportthepride\nof family distinctions, it is still likely to endure for many centuries.

Neither their\nsubstitutions nor fideicommisses bear any resemblance to entails, though\nsomeFrenchlawyershavethoughtpropertodressthemoderninstitution\ninthelanguageandgarbofthoseancientones.\n869 [6] When great landed estates were a sort of principalities, entails might\nnot be unreasonable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of some\nmonarchies, they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from\nbeing endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the\npresent state of Europe, when small as well as great estates derive their\nsecurity from the laws of their country, nothing can be more completely\n300", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nabsurd. They are founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions, the\nsupposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal\nrighttotheearth,andtoallthatitpossesses;butthatthepropertyofthe\npresent generation should be restrained and regulated according to the\nfancyofthosewhodiedperhapsfivehundredyearsago. Entails,however,\nare still respected through the greater part of Europe, in those countries\nparticularly in which noble birth is a necessary qualification for the en-\njoyment either of civil or military honours. Entails are thought necessary\nfor maintaining this exclusive privilege of the nobility to the great offices G.ed.p385\nand honours of their country; and that order having usurped one unjust\nadvantage over the rest of their fellow citizens, lest their poverty should\nrender it ridiculous, it is thought reasonable that they should have an-\nother. The common law of England, indeed, is said to abhor perpetuities,\nandtheyareaccordinglymorerestrictedtherethaninanyotherEuropean\nmonarchy; though even England is not altogether without them. In Scot-\nland more than one-fifth, perhaps more than one-third, part of the whole\nlandsofthecountryareatpresentsupposedtobeunderstrictentail.\n870 [7] Great tracts of uncultivated land were, in this manner, not only en-\ngrossed by particular families, but the possibility of their being divided\nagainwasasmuchaspossibleprecludedforever. Itseldomhappens,how-\never, that a great proprietor is a great improver. In the disorderly times\nwhichgavebirthtothosebarbarousinstitutions,thegreatproprietorwas\nsufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in extending his\njurisdictionandauthorityoverthoseofhisneighbours. Hehadnoleisure\nto attend to the cultivation and improvement of land.

Ifhewasaneconom-\nist, he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual savings in\nnewpurchasesthanintheimprovementofhisoldestate. Toimproveland\nwith profit, like all other commercial projects, requires an exact attention\nto small savings and small gains, of which a man born to a great fortune,\neven though naturally frugal, is very seldom capable.

The turn of mind which this habit naturally forms follows\nhim when he comes to think of the improvement of land. He embellishes\nperhaps four or five hundred acres in the neighbourhood of his house, at\ntentimestheexpensewhichthelandisworthafterallhisimprovements;\nand finds that if he was to improve his whole estate in the same manner,\nand he has little taste for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he\nhad finished the tenth part of it.

They were all or almost all slaves; but their slavery was of a milder\nkind than that known among the ancient Greeks and Romans, or even\nin our West Indian colonies. They were supposed to belong more directly\nto the land than to their master. They could, therefore, be sold with it,\nbut not separately. They could marry, provided it was with the consent of\ntheirmaster;andhecouldnotafterwardsdissolvethemarriagebyselling\nthe man and wife to different persons. If he maimed or murdered any of\nthem, he was liable to some penalty, though generally but to a small one.\nThey were not, however, capable of acquiring property.

Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on G.ed.p387\nby means of such slaves was properly carried on by their master. It was\nat his expense.

The\nplanting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expense of slave-cultivation.\nThe raising of corn, it seems, in the present times, cannot.

A\nslave,onthecontrary,whocanacquirenothingbuthismaintenance,con-\nsults his own ease by making the land produce as little as possible over\nand above that maintenance. It is probable that it was partly upon ac-\ncount of this advantage, and partly upon account of the encroachments\nwhich the sovereign, always jealous of the great lords, gradually encour-\naged their villains to make upon their authority, and which seem at last\nto have been such as rendered this species of servitude altogether incon-\nvenient, that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the greater\npart of Europe.

The Church of Rome claims great merit in it; and it is certain G.ed.p390\nthatsoearlyasthetwelfthcentury,AlexanderIIIpublishedabullforthe\ngeneral emancipation of slaves. It seems, however, to have been rather a\npious exhortation than a law to which exact obedience was required from\nthefaithful. Slaverycontinuedtotakeplacealmostuniversallyforseveral\ncenturiesafterwards,tillitwasgraduallyabolishedbythejointoperation\nof the two interests above mentioned, that of the proprietor on the one\nhand, and that of the sovereign on the other. A villain enfranchised, and\nat the same time allowed to continue in possession of the land, having no\nstockofhisown,couldcultivateitonlybymeansofwhatthelandlordad-\nvanced to him, and must, therefore, have been what the French called a\nMetayer.\n876 [13] It could never, however, be the interest even of this last species of cul-\ntivatorstolayout,inthefurtherimprovementoftheland,anypartofthe\nlittle stock which they might save from their own share of the produce,\nbecause the lord, who laid out nothing, was to get one half of whatever it\nproduced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce, is found to be a\nvery great hindrance to improvement. A tax, therefore, which amounted\nto one half must have been an effectual bar to it. It might be the interest\nofametayertomakethelandproduceasmuchascouldbebroughtoutof\nit by means of the stock furnished by the proprietor; but it could never be\nhisinteresttomixanypartofhisownwithit.

EveninEngland,thecountryperhapsof\nEurope where the yeomanry has always been most respected, it was not\ntill about the 14th of Henry the VIIth that the action of ejectment was\ninvented, by which the tenant recovers, not damages only but possession,\nand in which his claim is not necessarily concluded by the uncertain de-\ncision of a single assize.

Those laws and customs so favourable to\nthe yeomanry have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of\nEnglandthanalltheirboastedregulationsofcommercetakentogether.\n878 [15] The law which secures the longest leases against successors of every\nkind is, so far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced G.ed.p393\ninto Scotland so early as 1449, a law of James the IId. Its beneficial in-\nfluence, however, has been much obstructed by entails; the heirs of entail\nbeing generally restrained from letting leases for any long term of years,\nfrequentlyformorethanoneyear. AlateActofParliamenthas,inthisre-\nspect,somewhatslackenedtheirfetters,thoughtheyarestillbymuchtoo\nstrait. In Scotland, besides, as no leasehold gives a vote for a Member of\nParliament, the yeomanry are upon this account less respectable to their\nlandlordsthaninEngland.\n879 [16] In other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to secure ten-\nantsbothagainstheirsandpurchasers,thetermoftheirsecuritywasstill\nlimited to a very short period; in France, for example, to nine years from\nthecommencementofthelease. Ithasinthatcountry,indeed,beenlately\nextended to twenty-seven, a period still too short to encourage the tenant\nto make the most important improvements. The proprietors of land were\nancientlythelegislatorsofeverypartofEurope. Thelawsrelatingtoland,\ntherefore, were all calculated for what they supposed the interest of the\nproprietor. It was for his interest, they had imagined, that no lease gran-\nted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from enjoying, during a\nlong term of years, the full value of his land. Avarice and injustice are\nalways short-sighted, and they did not foresee how much this regulation\nmustobstructimprovement, andtherebyhurtinthelong-runtherealin-\nterestofthelandlord.\n305", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n880 [17] The farmers too, besides paying the rent, were anciently, it was sup-\nposed,boundtoperformagreatnumberofservicestothelandlord,which\nwereseldomeitherspecifiedinthelease,orregulatedbyanypreciserule,\nbutbytheuseandwontofthemanororbarony.

To make and maintain the high roads, a\nservitudewhichstillsubsists,Ibelieve,everywhere,thoughwithdifferent\ndegrees of oppression in different countries, was not the only one. When G.ed.p394\nthe king\u2019s troops, when his household or his officers of any kind passed\nthroughanypartofthecountry,theyeomanrywereboundtoprovidethem\nwithhorses,carriages,andprovisions,atapriceregulatedbythepurveyor.\nGreatBritainis,Ibelieve,theonlymonarchyinEuropewheretheoppres-\nsion of purveyance has been entirely abolished.

Theancientlords,thoughextremelyunwillingto\ngrantthemselvesanypecuniaryaidtotheirsovereign,easilyallowedhim\nto tallage, as they called it their tenants, and had not knowledge enough\nto foresee how much this must in the end affect their own revenue. The\ntaille, as it still subsists in France, may serve as an example of those an-\ncient tallages. It is a tax upon the supposed profits of the farmer, which\nthey estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm. It is his interest,\ntherefore, to appear to have as little as possible, and consequently to em-\nploy as little as possible in its cultivation, and none in its improvement.\nShould any stock happen to accumulate in the hands of a French farmer,\nthe taille is almost equal to a prohibition of its ever being employed upon\nthe land. This tax, besides, is supposed to dishonour whoever is subject\nto it, and to degrade him below, not only the rank of a gentleman, but\nthat of a burgher, and whoever rents the lands of another becomes sub-\njecttoit. Nogentleman,norevenanyburgherwhohasstock,willsubmit\nto this degradation. This tax, therefore, not only hinders the stock which\naccumulates upon the land from being employed in its improvement, but\ndrives away an other stock from it. The ancient tenths and fifteenths, so\nusualinEnglandinformertimes,seem,sofarastheyaffectedtheland,to G.ed.p395\nhavebeentaxesofthesamenaturewiththetaille.\n883 [20] Under all these discouragements, little improvement could be expec-\nted from the occupiers of land. That order of people, with all the liberty\nand security which law can give, must always improve under great dis-\nadvantages. The farmer, compared with the proprietor, is as a merchant\nwho trades with borrowed money compared with one who trades with his\nown. The stock of both may improve, but that of the one, with only equal\n306", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngoodconduct,mustalwaysimprovemoreslowlythanthatoftheother,on\naccountofthelargeshareoftheprofitswhichisconsumedbytheinterest\noftheloan. Thelandscultivatedbythefarmermust,inthesamemanner,\nwith only equal good conduct, be improved more slowly than those cultiv-\nated by the proprietor, on account of the large share of the produce which\nis consumed in the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he\nmighthaveemployedinthefurtherimprovementoftheland.

Itcanseldomhappen,therefore,thatamanofanyconsiderablestock\nshould quit the superior in order to place himself in an inferior station.\nEven in the present state of Europe, therefore, little stock is likely to go\nfrom any other profession to the improvement of land in the way of farm-\ning. MoredoesperhapsinGreatBritainthaninanyothercountry,though\neventherethegreatstockswhichare,insomeplaces,employedinfarming\nhave generally been acquired by farming, the trade, perhaps, in which of\nall others stock is commonly acquired most slowly. After small propriet-\nors, however, rich and great farmers are, in every country, the principal\nimprovers. There are more such perhaps in England than in any other\nEuropean monarchy. In the republican governments of Holland and of\nBerne in Switzerland, the farmers are said to be not inferior to those of\nEngland.\n884 [21] The ancient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavour- G.ed.p396\nable to the improvement and cultivation of land, whether carried on by\ntheproprietororbythefarmer; first, bythegeneralprohibitionoftheex-\nportation of corn without a special licence, which seems to have been a\nveryuniversalregulation; andsecondly,bytherestraintswhichwerelaid\nupontheinlandcommerce,notonlyofcorn,butofalmosteveryotherpart\nof the produce of the farm by the absurd laws against engrossers, regrat-\nors, and forestallers, and by the privileges of fairs and markets.

After the fall of the Roman empire, on the contrary, the propri-\netors of land seem generally to have lived in fortified castles on their own\nestates,andinthemidstoftheirowntenantsanddependants. Thetowns\nwere chiefly inhabited by tradesmen and mechanics, who seem in those\ndays to have been of servile, or very nearly of servile condition. The priv-\nilegeswhichwefindgrantedbyancientcharterstotheinhabitantsofsome\nof the principal towns in Europe sufficiently show what they were before\nthose grants. The people to whom it is granted as a privilege that they\nmight give away their own daughters in marriage without the consent of\ntheir lord, that upon their death their own children, and not their lord,\nshould succeed to their goods, and that they might dispose of their own\neffects by will, must, before those grants, have been either altogether or\nverynearlyinthesamestateofvillanagewiththeoccupiersoflandinthe\ncountry.\n886 [2] They seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people, who\nused to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from fair\nto fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times. In all the dif-\nferent countries of Europe then, in the same manner as in several of the\nTartar governments of Asia at present, taxes used to be levied upon the\npersons and goods of travellers when they passed through certain man-\nors, when they went over certain bridges, when they carried about their\ngoods from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or\nstall to sell them in. These different taxes were known in England by\nthenamesofpassage,pontage,lastage,andstallage. Sometimestheking, G.ed.p398", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nsometimes a great lord, who had, it seems, upon some occasions, author-\nity to do this, would grant to particular traders, to such particularly as\nlived in their own demesnes, a general exemption from such taxes. Such\ntraders, though in other respects of servile, or very nearly of servile con-\ndition, were upon this account called free-traders.

At first, both those poll-taxes and\nthose exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and to have af-\nfectedonlyparticularindividualsduringeithertheirlivesorthepleasure\nof their protectors.

Their advice\nconsisted of two different proposals. One was to erect a new order of jur-\nisdiction, by establishing magistrates and a town council in every consid-\nerable town of his demesnes.

Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their depu-\nties seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him as a counterbalance\nin those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin\nof the representation of burghs in the states-general of all the great mon-\narchiesinEurope.\n896 [12] Order and good government, and along with them the liberty and se- G.ed.p405\ncurity of individuals, were, in this manner, established in cities at a time\nwhentheoccupiersoflandinthecountrywereexposedtoeverysortofviol-\nence.

Onthecontrary, whentheyaresecureofen-\njoying the fruits of their industry, they naturally exert it to better their\ncondition, and to acquire not only the necessaries, but the conveniences\nand elegancies of life. That industry, therefore, which aims at something\nmore than necessary subsistence, was established in cities long before it\nwas commonly practised by the occupiers of land in the country.

Acitymightinthismannergrowuptogreatwealth\nand splendour, while not only the country in its neighbourhood, but all\nthosetowhichittraded,wereinpovertyandwretchedness. Eachofthose\ncountries, perhaps, taken singly, could afford it but a small part either of G.ed.p406\nits subsistence or of its employment, but all of them taken together could\nafford it both a great subsistence and a great employment. There were,\nhowever, within the narrow circle of the commerce of those times, some\ncountries that were opulent and industrious. Such was the Greek empire\nas long as it subsisted, and that of the Saracens during the reigns of the\nAbassides. Such too was Egypt till it was conquered by the Turks, some\npart of the coast of Barbary, and all those provinces of Spain which were\nunderthegovernmentoftheMoors.\n898 [14] The cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were\nraised by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence. Italy lay in\nthe centre of what was at that time the improved and civilised part of\nthe world. The Crusades too, though by the great waste of stock and de-\nstructionofinhabitantswhichtheyoccasionedtheymustnecessarilyhave\nretarded the progress of the greater part of Europe, were extremely fa-\nvourable to that of some Italian cities. The great armies which marched\nfromallpartstotheconquestoftheHolyLandgaveextraordinaryencour-\nagement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, sometimes in trans-\nportingthemthither,andalwaysinsupplyingthemwithprovisions. They\nwere the commissaries, if one may say so, of those armies; and the most\ndestructive frenzy that ever befell the European nations was a source of\nopulencetothoserepublics.\n899 [15] The inhabitantsof trading cities, by importing the improvedmanufac-\nturesandexpensiveluxuriesofrichercountries,affordedsomefoodtothe G.ed.p407\nvanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly purchased them with great\n313", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nquantitiesoftherudeproduceoftheirownlands.

But when this taste became so general as to occasion a\nconsiderable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expense of car-\nriage, naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the same\nkind in their own country. Hence the origin of the first manufactures for\ndistant sale that seem to have been established in the western provinces\nofEuropeafterthefalloftheRomanempire.\n901 [17] Nolargecountry,itmustbeobserved,everdidorcouldsubsistwithout\nsomesortofmanufacturesbeingcarriedoninit;andwhenitissaidofany\nsuchcountrythatithasnomanufactures,itmustalwaysbeunderstoodof\nthefinerandmoreimprovedorofsuchasarefitfordistantsale.

Such manufactures, therefore, are\ntheoffspringofforeigncommerce,andsuchseemtohavebeentheancient\nmanufactures of silks, velvets, and brocades, which flourished in Lucca\nduring the thirteenth century. They were banished from thence by the\ntyrannyofoneofMachiavel\u2019sheroes,CastruccioCastracani. In1310,nine\nhundred families were driven out of Lucca, of whom thirty-one retired to\nVenice and offered to introduce there the silk manufacture6.

Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally employed\nupon foreign materials, being imitations of foreign manufactures. When\nthe Venetian manufacture was first established, the materials were all\nbrought from Sicily and the Levant. The more ancient manufacture of\nLucca was likewise carried on with foreign materials.

Thosearts\nwerenotintroducedintoFrancetillthereignofCharlesIX.Themanufac-\ntures of Flanders were carried on chiefly with Spanish and English wool.\nSpanish wool was the material, not of the first woollen manufacture of\nEngland, but of the first that was fit for distant sale. More than one half\nthe materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day, foreign silk; when\nit was first established, the whole or very nearly the whole was so.

Aninlandcountry,\nnaturally fertile and easily cultivated, produces a great surplus of provi-\nsions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators, and on\naccount of the expense of land carriage, and inconveniency of river navig- G.ed.p409\nation, it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad. Abund-\nance,therefore,rendersprovisionscheap,andencouragesagreatnumber\nof workmen to settle in the neighbourhood, who find that their industry\ncan there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniencies of life\nthan in other places. They work up the materials of manufacture which\nthe land produces, and exchange their finished work, or what is the same\nthing the price of it, for more materials and provisions. They give a new\nvalue to the surplus part of the rude produce by saving the expense of\ncarrying it to the water side or to some distant market; and they furnish\nthe cultivators with something in exchange for it that is either useful or\nagreeable to them upon easier terms than they could have obtained it be-\nfore. The cultivators get a better price for their surplus produce, and can\npurchase cheaper other conveniences which they have occasion for. They\narethusbothencouragedandenabledtoincreasethissurplusproduceby\na further improvement and better cultivation of the land; and as the fer-\ntility of the land had given birth to the manufacture, so the progress of\n315", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe manufacture reacts upon the land and increases still further its fer-\ntility. Themanufacturersfirstsupplytheneighbourhood,andafterwards,\nas their work improves and refines, more distant markets. For though\nneither the rude produce nor even the coarse manufacture could, without\nthegreatestdifficulty,supporttheexpenseofaconsiderablelandcarriage,\nthe refined and improved manufacture easily may. In a small bulk it fre-\nquently contains the price of a great quantity of rude produce. A piece of\nfinecloth,forexample,whichweighsonlyeightypounds,containsinit,the\nprice, not only of eighty pounds\u2019 weight of wool, but sometimes of several\nthousand weight of corn, the maintenance of the different working people\nand of their immediate employers. The corn, which could with difficulty\nhavebeencarriedabroadinitsownshape, isinthismannervirtuallyex-\nportedinthatofthecompletemanufacture,andmayeasilybesenttothe\nremotest corners of the world. In this manner have grown up naturally,\nand as it were of their own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax,\nSheffield, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the\noffspring of agriculture. In the modern history of Europe, their extension G.ed.p410\nand improvement have generally been posterior to those which were the\noffspring of foreign commerce. England was noted for the manufacture of\nfine cloths made of Spanish wool more than a century before any of those\nwhichnowflourishintheplacesabovementionedwerefitforforeignsale.\nThe extension and improvement of these last could not take place but in\nconsequenceoftheextensionandimprovementofagriculturethelastand\ngreatesteffectofforeigncommerce,andofthemanufacturesimmediately\nintroducedbyit,andwhichIshallnowproceedtoexplain.\n316", "CHAPTER IV\nG.ed.p411\nHOW THE COMMERCE OF THE TOWNS\nCONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT\nOF THE COUNTRY\n905 [1] THE increaseandrichesofcommercialandmanufacturingtownscontrib-\nuted to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they\nbelongedinthreedifferentways.\n906 [2] First,byaffordingagreatandreadymarketfortherudeproduceofthe\ncountry, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improve-\nment. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in which they\nweresituated, butextended moreor lessto allthose withwhich theyhad\nany dealings.

The habits, besides, of order, G.ed.p412\neconomy, and attention, to which mercantile business naturally forms a\nmerchant, renderhim much fittertoexecute, with profitandsuccess, any\nprojectofimprovement.\n908 [4] Thirdly, and lastly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced\norder and good government, and with them, the liberty and security of\nindividuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived\nalmost in a continual state of war with their neighbours and of servile\ndependency upon their superiors. This, though it has been the least ob-\nserved, is by far the most important of all their effects.

Before the extension of commerce and manufacture in Europe, the\nhospitalityoftherich,andthegreat,fromthesovereigndowntothesmal-\nlest baron, exceeded everything which in the present times we can easily\nform a notion of. Westminster Hall was the dining-room of William Ru-\nfus, and might frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It\nwas reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket that he strewed\nthe floor of his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season, in order that\nthe knights and squires who could not get seats might not spoil their fine\nclothes when they sat down on the floor to eat their dinner. The great\nEarlofWarwickissaidtohaveentertainedeverydayathisdifferentman-\nors thirty thousand people, and though the number here may have been\nexaggerated, it must, however, have been very great to admit of such ex-\naggeration.

Itseemsto\nbe common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little\nknown. \u2018I have seen,\u2019 says Doctor Pocock, \u2018an Arabian chief dine in the G.ed.p114\nstreets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle, and invite all pas-\nsengers, even common beggars, to sit down with him and partake of his\nbanquet.\u2019\n910 [6] Theoccupiersoflandwereineveryrespectasdependentuponthegreat\nproprietor as his retainers.

No other persons had sufficient authority to do this.\nThe king in particular had not.

Tohaveenforcedpaymentofasmalldebtwithin\nthe lands of a great proprietor, where all the inhabitants were armed and\naccustomed to stand by one another, would have cost the king, had he at-\ntempted it by his own authority, almost the same effort as to extinguish\na civil war. He was, therefore, obliged to abandon the administration of\njustice through the greater part of the country to those who were capable\nof administering it; and for the same reason to leave the command of the\ncountrymilitiatothosewhomthatmilitiawouldobey.\n912 [8] Itisamistaketoimaginethatthoseterritorialjurisdictionstooktheir\norigin from the feudal law. Not only the highest jurisdictions both civil\nand criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coining money, and even\nthat of making bye-laws for the government of their own people, were all G.ed.p416\nrightspossessedallodiallybythegreatproprietorsoflandseveralcentur-\nies before even the name of the feudal law was known in Europe. The\nauthority and jurisdiction of the Saxon lords in England appear to have\nbeenasgreatbeforetheConquestasthatofanyoftheNormanlordsafter\nit. But the feudal law is not supposed to have become the common law of\nEngland till after the Conquest. That the most extensive authority and\njurisdictions were possessed by the great lords in France allodially long\n319", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbefore the feudal law was introduced into that country is a matter of fact\nthat admits of no doubt. That authority and those jurisdictions all neces-\nsarily flowed from the state of property and manners just now described.\nWithoutremountingtotheremoteantiquitiesofeithertheFrenchorEng-\nlish monarchies, we may find in much later times many proofs that such\neffectsmustalwaysflowfromsuchcauses.

He is said to have done G.ed.p417\nso with great equity, though without any of the formalities of justice; and\nit is not improbable that the state of that part of the country at that time\nmade it necessary for him to assume this authority in order to maintain\nthepublicpeace. Thatgentleman,whoserentneverexceededfivehundred\npounds a year, carried, in 1745, eight hundred of his own people into the\nrebellionwithhim.\n913 [9] The introduction of the feudal law, so far from extending, may be re-\ngardedasanattempttomoderatetheauthorityofthegreatallodiallords.\nIt established a regular subordination, accompanied with a long train of\nservicesandduties,fromthekingdowntothesmallestproprietor. During\nthe minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the management of\nhislands,fellintothehandsofhisimmediatesuperior,and,consequently,\nthose of all great proprietors into the hands of the king, who was charged\nwith the maintenance and education of the pupil, and who, from his au-\nthority as guardian, was supposed to have a right of disposing of him in\nmarriage, provided it was in a manner not unsuitable to his rank. But\nthough this institution necessarily tended to strengthen the authority of\ntheking,andtoweakenthatofthegreatproprietors,itcouldnotdoeither\nsufficientlyforestablishingorderandgoodgovernmentamongtheinhab-\nitants of the country, because it could not alter sufficiently that state of\nproperty and manners from which the disorders arose. The authority of G.ed.p418\ngovernment still continued to be, as before, too weak in the head and too\nstrong in the inferior members, and the excessive strength of the inferior\nmembers was the cause of the weakness of the head. After the institu-\ntion of feudal subordination, the king was as incapable of restraining the\nviolence of the great lords as before. They still continued to make war ac-\ncording to their own discretion, almost continually upon one another, and\nveryfrequentlyupontheking;andtheopencountrystillcontinuedtobea\nsceneofviolence,rapine,anddisorder.\n914 [10] But what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have\neffected,thesilentandinsensibleoperationofforeigncommerceandman-\nufactures gradually brought about. These gradually furnished the great\nproprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole sur-\nplus produce of their lands, and which they could consume themselves\n320", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwithout sharing it either with tenants or retainers. All for ourselves and\nnothingforotherpeople,seems,ineveryageoftheworld,tohavebeenthe\nvile maxim of the masters of mankind. As soon, therefore, as they could\nfindamethodofconsumingthewholevalueoftheirrentsthemselves,they\nhad no disposition to share them with any other persons. For a pair of\ndiamondbuckles, perhaps, orforsomethingasfrivolousanduseless, they G.ed.p419\nexchanged the maintenance, or what is the same thing, the price of the\nmaintenance of a thousand men for a year, and with it the whole weight\nand authority which it could give them. The buckles, however, were to\nbe all their own, and no other human creature was to have any share of\nthem; whereas in the more ancient method of expense they must have\nshared with at least a thousand people. With the judges that were to de-\nterminethepreferencethisdifferencewasperfectlydecisive;andthus,for\nthegratificationofthemostchildish, themeanest, andthemostsordidof\nallvanities,theygraduallybarteredtheirwholepowerandauthority.\n915 [11] In a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the finer\nmanufactures, a man of ten thousand a year cannot well employ his rev-\nenueinanyotherwaythaninmaintaining,perhaps,athousandfamilies,\nwho are all of them necessarily at his command. In the present state of\nEurope, a man of ten thousand a year can spend his whole revenue, and\nhegenerallydoesso,withoutdirectlymaintainingtwentypeople,orbeing\nable to command more than ten footmen not worth the commanding.

Its great price generally\narisesfromthewagesoftheirlabour,andtheprofitsofalltheirimmediate\nemployers.

He generally contributes, however, but a very\nsmallproportiontothatofeach,toveryfewperhapsatenth,tomanynota\nhundredth,andtosomenotathousandth,norevenaten-thousandthpart\nof their whole annual maintenance. Though he contributes, therefore, to\nthemaintenanceofthemall,theyareallmoreorlessindependentofhim,\nbecausegenerallytheycanallbemaintainedwithouthim.\n916 [12] When the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining\ntheir tenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his own\ntenantsandallhisownretainers. Butwhentheyspendtheminmaintain-\ning tradesmen and artificers, they may, all of them taken together, per-\nhaps, maintain as great, or, on account of the waste which attends rustic\nhospitality,agreaternumberofpeoplethanbefore.

Thoughinsomemeasureobligedtothem\nall,therefore,heisnotabsolutelydependentuponanyoneofthem.\n917 [13] The personal expense of the great proprietors having in this manner\ngradually increased, it was impossible that the number of their retain-\ners should not as gradually diminish till they were at last dismissed al-\ntogether. The same cause gradually led them to dismiss the unnecessary\npartoftheirtenants. Farmswereenlarged,andtheoccupiersofland,not-\nwithstanding the complaints of depopulation, reduced to the number ne-\ncessaryforcultivatingit,accordingtotheimperfectstateofcultivationand\nimprovement in those times.

Among simple nations, on the contrary, they fre-\nquentlydowithoutanyregulationsoflaw,foramongnationsofshepherds,\nsuch as the Tartars and Arabs, the consumable nature of their property\nnecessarilyrendersallsuchregulationsimpossible.\n921 [17] Arevolutionofthegreatestimportancetothepublichappinesswasin\nthis manner brought about by two different orders of people who had not\ntheleastintentiontoservethepublic.

Compare the slow progress of\nthose European countries of which the wealth depends very much upon\ntheir commerce and manufactures with the rapid advances of our North\nAmerican colonies, of which the wealth is founded altogether in agricul- G.ed.p423\nture. Through the greater part of Europe the number of inhabitants is\nnot supposed to double in less than five hundred years. In several of our\nNorthAmericancolonies,itisfoundtodoubleintwentyorfive-and-twenty\nyears. In Europe, the law of primogeniture and perpetuities of different\nkinds prevent the division of great estates, and thereby hinder the mul-\ntiplication of small proprietors. A small proprietor, however, who knows\nevery part of his little territory, who views it with all the affection which\nproperty, especiallysmallproperty, naturallyinspires, andwhouponthat\naccount takes pleasure not only in cultivating but in adorning it, is gen-\nerally of all improvers the most industrious, the most intelligent, and the\nmost successful. The same regulations, besides, keep so much land out of\nthe market that there are always more capitals to buy than there is land\n323", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto sell, so that what is sold always sells at a monopoly price. The rent\nnever pays the interest of the purchase-money, and is, besides, burdened\nwith repairs and other occasional charges to which the interest of money\nis not liable. To purchase land is everywhere in Europe a most unprofit-\nable employment of a small capital. For the sake of the superior security,\nindeed, a man of moderate circumstances, when he retires from business,\nwill sometimes choose to lay out his little capital in land. A man of pro-\nfession too, whose revenue is derived from. another source, often loves to\nsecure his savings in the same way. But a young man, who, instead of\napplying to trade or to some profession, should employ a capital of two or\nthreethousandpoundsinthepurchaseandcultivationofasmallpieceof\nland,mightindeedexpecttoliveveryhappily,andveryindependently,but\nmustbidadieuforevertoallhopeofeithergreatfortuneorgreatillustra-\ntion, which by a different employment of his stock he might have had the\nsamechanceofacquiringwithotherpeople.

In\ntimes of moderate plenty, the importation of foreign corn is loaded with\ndutiesthatamounttoaprohibition.

The cultiva-\ntion and improvement of France, however, is, upon the whole, inferior to\nthat of England.

In consequence of its being the\ninstrumentofcommerce,whenwehavemoneywecanmorereadilyobtain\nwhateverelsewehaveoccasionforthanbymeansofanyothercommodity.\nThe great affair, we always find, is to get money.

To grow rich is to get money; and wealth and money, in short, are, in\ncommonlanguage,consideredasineveryrespectsynonymous.\n932 [2] A rich country, in the same manner as a rich man, is supposed to be a\ncountry abounding in money; and to heap up gold and saver in any coun-\ntryissupposedtobethereadiestwaytoenrichit. Forsometimeafterthe\ndiscoveryofAmerica,thefirstinquiryoftheSpaniards,whentheyarrived\nupon an unknown coast, used to be, if there was any gold or silver to be\nfoundintheneighbourhood. Bytheinformationwhichtheyreceived,they\njudged whether it was worth while to make a settlement there, or if the\ncountry was worth the conquering. Plano Carpino, a monk, sent ambas-\nsador from the King of France to one of the sons of the famous Genghis\nKhan,saysthattheTartarsusedfrequentlytoaskhimiftherewasplenty\nof sheep and oxen in the kingdom of France? Their inquiry had the same G.ed.p430\nobjectwiththatoftheSpaniards. Theywantedtoknowifthecountrywas\nrich enough to be worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as among\nall other nations of shepherds, who are generally ignorant of the use of\nmoney,cattlearetheinstrumentsofcommerceandthemeasuresofvalue.\nWealth, therefore, according to them, consisted in cattle, as according to\ntheSpaniardsitconsistedingoldandsilver. Ofthetwo,theTartarnotion,\nperhaps,wasthenearesttothetruth.", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n933 [3] Mr. Locke remarks a distinction between money and other movable\ngoods. All other movable goods, he says, are of so consumable a nature\nthatthewealthwhichconsistsinthemcannotbemuchdependedon, and\na nation which abounds in them one year may, without any exportation,\nbut merely their own waste and extravagance, be in great want of them\nthenext. Money, onthecontrary, isasteadyfriend, which, thoughitmay\ntravelaboutfromhandtohand, yetifitcanbekeptfromgoingoutofthe\ncountry, is not very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and silver,\ntherefore,are,accordingtohim,themostsolidandsubstantialpartofthe\nmovablewealthofanation,andtomultiplythosemetalsought,hethinks,\nuponthataccount,tobethegreatobjectofitspolitical\u0153conomy.\n934 [4] Others admit that if a nation could be separated from all the world, it\nwould be of no consequence how much, or how little money circulated in\nit. The consumable goods which were circulated by means of this money\nwould only be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of pieces;\nbut the real wealth or poverty of the country, they allow, would depend\naltogetherupontheabundanceorscarcityofthoseconsumablegoods. But G.ed.p431\nit is otherwise, they think, with countries which have connections with\nforeign nations, and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars, and to\nmaintain fleets and armies in distant countries. This, they say, cannot be\ndonebutbysendingabroadmoneytopaythemwith;andanationcannot\nsend much money abroad unless it has a good deal at home. Every such\nnation,therefore,mustendeavourintimeofpeacetoaccumulategoldand\nsilver that, when occasion requires, it may have wherewithal to carry on\nforeignwars.\n935 [5] In consequence of these popular notions, all the different nations of\nEuropehavestudied,thoughtolittlepurpose,everypossiblemeansofac-\ncumulating gold and silver in their respective countries. Spain and Por-\ntugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which supply Europe with\nthose metals, have either prohibited their exportation under the severest\npenalties,orsubjectedittoaconsiderableduty.

The like policy anciently took\nplacebothinFranceandEngland.\n936 [6] When those countries became commercial, the merchants found this\nprohibition,uponmanyoccasions,extremelyinconvenient. Theycouldfre-\nquentlybuymoreadvantageouslywithgoldandsilverthanwithanyother\ncommoditytheforeigngoodswhichtheywanted,eithertoimportintotheir\nown, or to carry to some other foreign country. They remonstrated, there-\nfore,againstthisprohibitionashurtfultotrade.\n937 [7] Theyrepresented,first,thattheexportationofgoldandsilverinorder\nto purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those\nmetalsinthekingdom. That,onthecontrary,itmightfrequentlyincrease\n330", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthatquantity;because,iftheconsumptionofforeigngoodswasnotthereby\nincreasedinthecountry,thosegoodsmightbere-exportedtoforeigncoun-\ntries,and,beingtheresoldforalargeprofit,mightbringbackmuchmore\ntreasure than was originally sent out to purchase them. Mr. Mun com-\npares this operation of foreign trade to the seed-time and harvest of agri-\nculture. \u2018Ifweonlybehold,\u2019sayshe,\u2018theactionsofthehusbandmaninthe\nseed-time,whenhecastethawaymuchgoodcornintotheground,weshall\naccounthimratheramadmanthanahusbandman.

That\nthis exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to, what\nthey called, the balance of trade. That when the country exported to a\ngreater value than it imported, a balance became due to it from foreign\nnations, which was necessarily paid to it in gold and silver, and thereby\nincreased the quantity of those metals in the kingdom. But that when it\nimported to a greater value than it exported, a contrary balance became\ndue to foreign nations, which was necessarily paid to them in the same\nmanner, and thereby diminished that quantity. That in this case to pro-\nhibittheexportationofthosemetalscouldnotpreventit,butonly,bymak-\ning it more dangerous, render it more expensive. That the exchange was\nthereby turned more against the country which owed the balance than it\notherwise might have been; the merchant who purchased a bill upon the\nforeign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it, not only for\nthe natural risk, trouble, and expense of sending the money thither, but\nfortheextraordinaryriskarisingfromtheprohibition. Butthatthemore\nthe exchange was against any country, the more the balance of trade be- G.ed.p433\ncamenecessarilyagainstit;themoneyofthatcountrybecomingnecessar-\nily of so much less value in comparison with that of the country to which\nthebalancewasdue.

They were solid, too, in\nassertingthatnoprohibitioncouldpreventtheirexportationwhenprivate\npeoplefoundanyadvantageinexportingthem.

They were sophistical too, perhaps, in asserting that the high\npriceofexchangenecessarilyincreasedwhattheycalledtheunfavourable\nbalanceoftrade,oroccasionedtheexportationofagreaterquantityofgold\nandsilver. Thathighprice,indeed,wasextremelydisadvantageoustothe\nmerchants who had any money to pay in foreign countries.

Thehighpriceofexchange,besides,mustnecessarilyhaveoper-\natedasatax,inraisingthepriceofforeigngoods,andtherebydiminishing\ntheir consumption. It would tend, therefore, not to increase but to dimin-\nish what they called the unfavourable balance of trade, and consequently\ntheexportationofgoldandsilver.\n940 [10] Such as they were, however, those arguments convinced the people to\nwhomtheywereaddressed.

Those\nargumentsthereforeproducedthewished-foreffect. Theprohibitionofex-\nporting gold and silver was in France and England confined to the coin of\nthose respective countries. The exportation of foreign coin and of bullion\nwas made free. In Holland, and in some other places, this liberty was ex-\ntended even to the coin of the country.

But no commodities regulate themselves\nmore easily or more exactly according to this effectual demand than gold\nand silver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of those\nmetals, no commodities can be more easily transported from one place to\n333", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nanother, from the places where they are cheap to those where they are\ndear, from the places where they exceed to those where they fall short of\nthiseffectualdemand.

All the sanguinary\nlaws of the customs are not able to prevent the importation of the teas\nof the Dutch and Gottenburgh East India Companies, because somewhat\ncheaper than those of the British company. A pound of tea, however, is\nabout a hundred times the bulk of one of the highest prices, sixteen shil-\nlings, that is commonly paid for it in silver, and more than two thousand\ntimes the bulk of the same price in gold, and consequently just so many\ntimesmoredifficulttosmuggle.\n944 [14] It is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver from G.ed.p437\nthe places where they abound to those where they are wanted that the\npriceofthosemetalsdoesnotfluctuatecontinuallylikethatofthegreater\npart ofother commodities, which arehindered by their bulk fromshifting\ntheirsituationwhenthemarkethappenstobeeitheroverorunder-stocked\nwith them.

But\nto make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver, so as to raise\nor lower at once, sensibly and remarkably, the money price of all other\ncommodities, requires such a revolution in commerce as that occasioned\nbythediscoveryofAmerica.\n945 [15] If,notwithstandingallthis,goldandsilvershouldatanytimefallshort\n334", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ninacountrywhichhaswherewithaltopurchasethem,therearemoreex-\npedientsforsupplyingtheirplacethanthatofalmostanyothercommodity.\nIf the materials of manufacture are wanted, industry must stop. If provi-\nsions are wanted, the people must starve. But if money is wanted, barter\nwillsupplyitsplace,thoughwithagooddealofinconveniency. Buyingand\nselling upon credit, and the different dealers compensating their credits\nwith one another, once a month or once a year, will supply it with less in-\nconveniency. Awell-regulatedpapermoneywillsupplyit,notonlywithout\nanyinconveniency,but,insomecases,withsomeadvantages. Uponevery\naccount, therefore, the attention of government never was so unnecessar-\nily employed as when directed to watch over the preservation or increase\nofthequantityofmoneyinanycountry.\n946 [16] No complaint, however, is more common than that of a scarcity of\nmoney. Money, like wine, must always be scarce with those who have\nneither wherewithal to buy it nor credit to borrow it. Those who have\neither will seldom be in want either of the money or of the wine which\ntheyhaveoccasionfor. Thiscomplaint,however,ofthescarcityofmoneyis\nnot always confined to improvident spendthrifts. It is sometimes general\nthrough a whole mercantile town and the country in its neighbourhood.\nOvertrading is the common cause of it.

Evensuchgeneralcomplaintsofthescarcityofmoneydonotalways\nprove that the usual number of gold and silver pieces are not circulating\nin the country, but that many people want those pieces who have nothing\nto give for them. When the profits of trade happen to be greater than or-\ndinary, overtrading becomes a general error both among great and small\ndealers. Theydonotalwayssendmoremoneyabroadthanusual,butthey\nbuy upon credit, both at home and abroad, an unusual quantity of goods,\nwhich they send to some distant market in hopes that the returns will\ncome in before the demand for payment. The demand comes before the\nreturns, and they have nothing at hand with which they can either pur-\nchase money, or give solid security for borrowing. It is not any scarcity of\ngoldandsilver,butthedifficultywhichsuchpeoplefindinborrowing,and\nwhich their creditors find in getting payment, that occasions the general\ncomplaintofthescarcityofmoney.\n947 [17] Itwouldbetooridiculoustogoaboutseriouslytoprovethatwealthdoes\nnot consist in money, or in gold and silver; but in what money purchases,\nandisvaluableonlyforpurchasing. Money,nodoubt,makesalwaysapart\nof the national capital; but it has already been shown that it generally\nmakesbutasmallpart,andalwaysthemostunprofitablepartofit.\n948 [18] It is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in\n335", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngoods that the merchant find it generally more easy to buy goods with\nmoney than to buy money with goods; but because money is the known\nand established instrument of commerce, for which everything is readily\ngiven in exchange, but which is not always with equal readiness to be got\nin exchange for everything. The greater part of goods, besides, are more\nperishable than money, and he may frequently sustain a much greater\nloss by keeping them. When his goods are upon hand, too, he is more\nliable to such demands for money as he may not be able to answer than\nwhen he has got their price in his coffers. Over and above all this, his\nprofit arises more directly from selling than from buying, and he is upon\nalltheseaccountsgenerallymuchmoreanxioustoexchangehisgoodsfor\nmoney,thanhismoneyforgoods. Butthoughaparticularmerchant,with G.ed.p439\nabundance of goods in his warehouse, may sometimes be ruined by not\nbeing able to sell them in time, a nation or country is not liable to the\nsame accident. The whole capital of a merchant frequently consists in\nperish, able goods destined for purchasing money. But it is but a very\nsmallpartoftheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofacountrywhich\ncaneverbedestinedforpurchasinggoldandsilverfromtheirneighbours.\nThe far greater part is circulated and consumed among themselves; and\neven of the surplus which is sent abroad, the greater part is generally\ndestined for the purchase of other foreign goods.

By the great number of people who are\nmaintained abroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are cir-\nculated there, and less money becomes necessary to circulate them. An\nextraordinary quantity of paper money, of some sort or other, such as ex-\nchequer notes, navy bills, and bank bills in England, is generally issued\nupon such occasions, and by supplying the place of circulating gold and\nsilver, givesan opportunity of sending a greater quantityof it abroad. All\nthis, however, could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a foreign\nwarofgreatexpenseandseveralyearsduration.\n954 [24] Themeltingdowntheplateofprivatefamilieshasuponeveryoccasion\nbeen found a still more insignificant one.

The channel of circulation, however, never appeared more empty\nthanusualduringanypartofthisperiod. Fewpeoplewantedmoneywho\nhad wherewithal to pay for it. The profits of foreign trade, indeed, were\ngreater than usual during the whole war; but especially towards the end\nofit. Thisoccasioned,whatitalwaysoccasions,ageneralovertradinginall\nthe parts of Great Britain; and this again occasioned the usual complaint\nof the scarcity of money, which always follows overtrading. Many people\nwanted it, who had neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it;\nand because the debtors found it difficult to borrow, the creditors found it\ndifficulttogetpayment.

ThegreatquantityofBritishgoodsexportedduringthecourse\nofthelatewar,withoutbringingbackanyreturns,isaccordinglyremarked\nbytheauthorofThePresentStateoftheNation.\n958 [28] Besides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned, there is in\nallgreatcommercialcountriesagooddealofbullionalternatelyimported\nand exported for the purposes of foreign trade. This bullion, as it circu-\nlates among different commercial countries in the same manner as the\nnational coin circulates in every particular country, may be considered as\nthe money of the great mercantile republic. The national coin receives its\nmovement and direction from the commodities circulated within the pre-\ncincts of each particular country: the money of the mercantile republic,\nfrom those circulated between different countries. Both are employed in\nfacilitating exchanges, the one between different individuals of the same,\nthe other between those of different nations. Part of this money of the\ngreat mercantile republic may have been, and probably was, employed in\ncarrying on the late war. In time of a general war, it is natural to sup-\nposethatamovementanddirectionshouldbeimpresseduponit,different\nfrom what it usually follows in profound peace; that it should circulate\nmoreabouttheseatofthewar,andbemoreemployedinpurchasingthere,\nand in the neighbouring countries, the pay and provisions of the different\narmies. ButwhateverpartofthismoneyofthemercantilerepublicGreat G.ed.p444\nBritain may have annually employed in this manner, it must have been\nannually purchased, either with British commodities, or with something\nelsethathadbeenpurchasedwiththem;whichstillbringsusbacktocom-\nmodities, to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as\nthe ultimate resources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is nat-\nural indeed to suppose that so great an annual expense must have been\ndefrayed from a great annual produce. The expense of 1761, for example,\namounted to more than nineteen millions. No accumulation could have\nsupportedsogreatanannualprofusion. Thereisnoannualproduceeven\nof gold and silver which could have supported it. The whole gold and sil-\nverannuallyimportedintobothSpainandPortugal,accordingtothebest\naccounts, does not commonly much exceed six millions sterling, which, in\nsomeyears,wouldscarcehavepaidfourmonth\u2019sexpenseofthelatewar.\n959 [29] The commodities most proper for being transported to distant coun-\ntries, inordertopurchasethereeitherthepayandprovisionsofanarmy,\norsomepartofthemoneyofthemercantilerepublictobeemployedinpur-\nchasingthem,seemtobethefinerandmoreimprovedmanufactures;such\nas contain a great value in a small bulk, and can, therefore, be exported\nto a great distance at little expense. A country whose industry produces\na great annual surplus of such manufactures, which are usually exported\nto foreign countries, may carry on for many years a very expensive for-\neign war without either exporting any considerable quantity of gold and\nsilver, or even having any such quantity to export. A considerable part of\n340", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe annual surplus of its manufactures must, indeed, in this case be ex-\nportedwithoutbringingbackanyreturnstothecountry,thoughitdoesto\nthe merchant; the government purchasing of the merchant his bills upon\nforeign countries, in order to purchase there the pay and provisions of an\narmy. Somepartofthissurplus,however,maystillcontinuetobringback\na return. The manufacturers, during the war, will have a double demand\nupon them, and be called upon, first, to work up goods to be sent abroad,\nfor paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provi-\nsions of the army; and, secondly, to work up such as are necessary for\npurchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the\ncountry. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore, the G.ed.p445\ngreater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly; and, on the\ncontrary, they may decline on the return of the peace. They may flourish\namidsttheruinoftheircountry,andbegintodecayuponthereturnofits\nprosperity. The different state of many different branches of the British\nmanufacturesduringthelatewar,andforsometimeafterthepeace,may\nserveasanillustrationofwhathasbeenjustnowsaid.\n960 [30] No foreign war of great expense or duration could conveniently be car-\nried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil. The expense\nof sending such a quantity of it to a foreign country as might purchase\nthe pay and provisions of an army would be too great.

Between\nwhatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two\ndistinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the produce\nof their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and\nbrings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand.\nIt gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something\nelse, which may satisfy a part of their wants, and increase their enjoy-\nments.

To\nimport the gold and silver which may be wanted into the countries which\nhave no mines is, no doubt, a part of the business of foreign commerce. It\nis,however,amostinsignificantpartofit. Acountrywhichcarriedonfor-\neign trade merely upon this account could scarce have occasion to freight\nashipinacentury.\n962 [32] ItisnotbytheimportationofgoldandsilverthatthediscoveryofAmer-\nica has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, those\nmetals have become cheaper. A service of plate can now be purchased for\naboutathirdpartofthecorn,orathirdpartofthelabour,whichitwould\nhave cost in the fifteenth century. With the same annual expense of la-\nbour and commodities, Europe can annually purchase about three times\nthe quantity of plate which it could have purchased at that time. But\nwhen a commodity comes to be sold for a third part of what had been its\nusual price, not only those who purchased it before can purchase three\ntimes their former quantity, but it is brought down to the level of a much\ngreaternumberofpurchasers,perhapstomorethanten,perhapstomore\nthan twenty times the former number. So that there may be in Europe at\npresent not only more than three times, but more than twenty or thirty\ntimesthequantityofplatewhichwouldhavebeeninit,eveninitspresent\nstateofimprovement,hadthediscoveryoftheAmericanminesneverbeen\nmade. So far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency, though G.ed.p448\nsurely a very trifling one. The cheapness of gold and silver renders those\nmetalsrather lessfit forthe purposesof moneythan theywere before. In\nordertomakethesamepurchases,wemustloadourselveswithagreater\nquantity of them, and carry about a shilling in our pocket where a groat\nwould have done before. It is difficult to say which is most trifling, this\ninconveniency or the opposite conveniency. Neither the one nor the other\ncould have made any very essential change in the state of Europe. The\ndiscovery of America, however, certainly made a most essential one.

Anewset\nofexchanges,therefore,begantotakeplacewhichhadneverbeenthought\nofbefore,andwhichshouldnaturallyhaveprovedasadvantageoustothe\nnew, as it certainly did to the old continent. The savage injustice of the\nEuropeans rendered an event, which ought to have been beneficial to all,\nruinousanddestructivetoseveralofthoseunfortunatecountries.\n963 [33] ThediscoveryofapassagetotheEastIndiesbytheCapeofGoodHope,\n343", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwhich happened much about the same time, opened perhaps a still more\nextensive range to foreign commerce than even that of America, notwith-\nstanding the greater distance. There were but two nations in America in\nany respect superior to savages, and these were destroyed almost as soon\nas discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the empires of China,\nIndostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East Indies, without\nhaving richer mines of gold or silver, were in every other respect much\nricher, bettercultivated, andmoreadvancedinallartsandmanufactures\nthan either Mexico or Peru, even though we should credit, what plainly\ndeserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spanish writers con-\ncerning the ancient state of those empires. But rich and civilised nations\ncanalwaysexchangetoamuchgreatervaluewithoneanotherthanwith\nsavagesandbarbarians. Europe,however,hashithertoderivedmuchless\nadvantage from its commerce with the East Indies than from that with G.ed.p449\nAmerica. ThePortuguesemonopolizedtheEastIndiatradetothemselves\nfor about a century, and it was only indirectly and through them that the\nother nations of Europe could either send out or receive any goods from\nthatcountry. WhentheDutch, inthebeginningofthelastcentury, began\nto encroach upon them, they vested their whole East India commerce in\nan exclusive company. The English, French, Swedes, and Danes have all\nfollowed their example, so that no great nation in Europe has ever yet\nhad the benefit of a free commerce to the East Indies. No other reason\nneed be assigned why it has never been so advantageous as the trade to\nAmerica,which,betweenalmosteverynationofEuropeanditsowncolon-\nies, is free to all its subjects. The exclusive privileges of those East India\ncompanies,theirgreatriches,thegreatfavourandprotectionwhichthese\nhaveprocuredthemfromtheirrespectivegovernments,haveexcitedmuch\nenvy against them. This envy has frequently represented their trade as\naltogether pernicious, on account of the great quantities of silver which\nit every year exports from the countries from which it is carried on. The\npartiesconcernedhaverepliedthattheirtrade,bythiscontinualexporta-\ntion of silver, might indeed tend to impoverish Europe in general, but not\nthe particular country from which it was carried on; because, by the ex-\nportationofapartofthereturnstootherEuropeancountries,itannually\nbrought home a much greater quantity of that metal than it carried out.\nBoththeobjectionandthereplyarefoundedinthepopularnotionwhichI\nhavebeenjustnowexamining. Itisthereforeunnecessarytosayanything\nfurther about either.

G.ed.p450\nSome of the best English writers upon commerce set out with observing\nthat the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but\nin its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds. In the\ncourse of their reasonings, however, the lands, houses, and consumable\ngoods seem to slip out of their memory, and the strain of their argument\nfrequently supposes that all wealth consists in gold and silver, and that\nto multiply those metals is the great object of national industry and com-\nmerce.\n965 [35] The two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted\nin gold and silver, and that those metals could be brought into a coun-\ntry which had no mines only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to\na greater value than it imported, it necessarily became the great object\nof political economy to diminish as much as possible the importation of\nforeign goods for home consumption, and to increase as much as possible\nthe exportation of the produce of domestic industry. Its two great engines\nforenrichingthecountry,therefore,wererestraintsuponimportation,and\nencouragementstoexportation.\n966 [36] Therestraintsuponimportationwereoftwokinds.\n967 [37] First, restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home\nconsumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they\nwereimported.\n968 [38] Secondly, restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds\nfrom those particular countries with which the balance of trade was sup-\nposedtobedisadvantageous.\n969 [39] Those different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and\nsometimesinabsoluteprohibitions.\n970 [40] Exportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by\nbounties, sometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign\nstates, and sometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant coun-\ntries.\n971 [41] Drawbacks were given upon two different occasions. When the home\nmanufactures were subject to any duty or excise, either the whole or a\npart of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when\nforeigngoodsliabletoadutywereimportedinordertobeexportedagain,\n345", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\neitherthewholeorapartofthisdutywassometimesgivenbackuponsuch\nexportation.\n972 [42] Bounties were given for the encouragement either of some beginning\nmanufactures, or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as supposed to\ndeserveparticularfavour.\n973 [43] By advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were pro- G.ed.p451\ncured in some foreign state for the goods and merchants of the country,\nbeyondwhatweregrantedtothoseothercountries.\n974 [44] By established establishment of colonies in distant countries, not only\nparticularprivileges,butamonopolywasfrequentlyprocuredforthegoods\nandmerchantsofthecountrywhichestablishedthem.\n975 [45] Thetwosortsofrestraintsuponimportationabove-mentioned,together\nwiththesefourencouragementstoexportation,constitutethesixprincipal\nmeans by which the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity\nof gold and silver in any country by turning the balance of trade in its\nfavour.

But whether it tends either to increase the general industry of\nthe society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps,\naltogethersoevident.\n978 [3] The general industry of the society never can exceed what the capital\nof the society can employ.

He can know better the character and situation of\nthe persons whom he trusts, and if he should happen to be deceived, he\nknows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress.\nIn the carrying trade, the capital of the merchant is, as it were, divided\nbetweentwoforeigncountries,andnopartofitisevernecessarilybrought\nhome,orplacedunderhisownimmediateviewandcommand. Thecapital\nwhichanAmsterdammerchantemploysincarryingcornfromKonigsberg\nto Lisbon, and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Konigsberg, must generally\nbe the one half of it at Konigsberg and the other half at Lisbon. No part\nof it need ever come to Amsterdam.

The mer-\nchant,inordertosaveasecondloadingandunloading,endeavoursalways\ntosellinthehomemarketasmuchofthegoodsofallthosedifferentcoun-\ntries as he can, and thus, so far as he can, to convert his carrying trade\n348", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nintoaforeigntradeofconsumption.

He saves himself the risk\nand trouble of exportation, when, so far as he can, he thus converts his\nforeign trade of consumption into a home trade. Home is in this manner\nthe centre, if I may say so, round which the capitals of the inhabitants of\nevery country are continually circulating, and towards which they are al-\nways tending, though by particular causes they may sometimes be driven\noff and repelled from it towards more distant employments. But a capital\nemployed in the home trade, it has already been shown, necessarily puts\nintomotionagreaterquantityofdomesticindustry,andgivesrevenueand\nemploymenttoagreaternumberoftheinhabitantsofthecountry,thanan\nequal capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption: and one em-\nployedintheforeigntradeofconsumptionhasthesameadvantageoveran\nequal capital employed in the carrying trade.

It is\nan affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few\nwordsneedbeemployedindissuadingthemfromit.\n985 [10] What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ,\nand of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every indi-\nvidual,itisevident,can,inhislocalsituation,judgemuchbetterthanany\nstatesmanorlawgivercandoforhim. Thestatesmanwhoshouldattempt\nto direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their cap-\nitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but\nassume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single\nperson, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere\nbe so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption\nenoughtofancyhimselffittoexerciseit.\n986 [11] To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic\nindustry,inanyparticularartormanufacture,isinsomemeasuretodirect\nprivate people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and\nmust, in almost all cases, be either a useless or a hurtful regulation. If\nthe produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign\nindustry,theregulationisevidentlyuseless. Ifitcannot,itmustgenerally\nbe hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to\nattempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.\nThe tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the\nshoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, G.ed.p457\nbut employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor\nthe other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it for\ntheir interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have\nsome advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its\nproduce,orwhatisthesamething,withthepriceofapartofit,whatever\nelsetheyhaveoccasionfor.\n987 [12] What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be\nfolly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a\ncommodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them\nwith some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in\nwhich we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, be-\ning always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby\nbe diminished, no more than that of the above-mentioned artificers; but\nonlylefttofindoutthewayinwhichitcanbeemployedwiththegreatest\nadvantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage when\nit is thus directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can\nmake. The value of its annual produce is certainly more or less dimin-\nished when it is thus turned away from producing commodities evidently\nofmorevaluethanthecommoditywhichitisdirectedtoproduce. Accord-\ning to the supposition, that commodity could be purchased from foreign\ncountries cheaper than it can be made at home. It could, therefore, have\n350", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbeen purchased with a part only of the commodities, or, what is the same\nthing,withapartonlyofthepriceofthecommodities,whichtheindustry\nemployed by an equal capital would have produced at home, had it been\nleft to follow its natural course. The industry of the country, therefore, is\nthus turned away from a more to a less advantageous employment, and\nthe exchangeable value of its annual produce, instead of being increased,\naccordingtotheintentionofthelawgiver,mustnecessarilybediminished\nbyeverysuchregulation.\n988 [13] By means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may G.ed.p458\nsometimesbeacquiredsoonerthanitcouldhavebeenotherwise,andafter\na certain time may be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in the for-\neign country. But though the industry of the society may be thus carried\nwith advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could have been\notherwise, it will by no means follow that the sum total, either of its in-\ndustry, or of its revenue, can ever be augmented by any such regulation.\nThe industry of the society can augment only in proportion as its capital\naugments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to what can be\ngraduallysavedoutofitsrevenue. Buttheimmediateeffectofeverysuch\nregulation is to diminish its revenue, and what diminishes its revenue is\ncertainly not very likely to augment its capital faster than it would have\naugmentedofitsownaccordhadbothcapitalandindustrybeenlefttofind\nouttheirnaturalemployments.\n989 [14] Though for want of such regulations the society should never acquire\ntheproposedmanufacture,itwouldnot,uponthataccount,necessarilybe\nthe poorer in any one period of its duration. In every period of its dura-\ntionitswholecapitalandindustrymightstillhavebeenemployed,though\nupon different objects, in the manner that was most advantageous at the\ntime. In every period its revenue might have been the greatest which its\ncapital could afford, and both capital and revenue might have been aug-\nmentedwiththegreatestpossiblerapidity.\n990 [15] The natural advantages which one country has over another in pro-\nducing particular commodities are sometimes so great that it is acknow-\nledged by all the world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of\nglasses, hotbeds, and hot walls, very good grapes can be raised in Scot-\nland, and very good wine too can be made of them at about thirty times\nthe expense for which at least equally good can be brought from foreign\ncountries. Would it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all\nforeign wines merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in\nScotland? But if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning towards\nanyemploymentthirtytimesmoreofthecapitalandindustryofthecoun-\ntry than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an equal\nquantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an absurdity, though\nnotaltogethersoglaring,yetexactlyofthesamekind,inturningtowards\nany such employment a thirtieth, or even a three-hundredth part more of\neither. Whether the advantages which one country has over another be\n351", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnaturaloracquiredisinthisrespectofnoconsequence. Aslongastheone\ncountry has those advantages, and the other wants them, it will always\nbe more advantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former than to\nmake. It is an acquired advantage only, which one artificer has over his G.ed.p459\nneighbour,whoexercisesanothertrade;andyettheybothfinditmoread-\nvantageous to buy of one another than to make what does not belong to\ntheirparticulartrades.\n991 [16] Merchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest\nadvantagefromthismonopolyofthehomemarket. Theprohibitionofthe\nimportationofforeigncattle,andofsaltprovisions,togetherwiththehigh\nduties upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a\nprohibition, are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of\nGreat Britain as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants\nand manufacturers. Manufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are\nmore easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle.\nIt is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accordingly, that foreign\ntrade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very small advantage will\nenable foreigners to undersell our own workmen, even in the home mar-\nket. It will require a very great one to enable them to do so in the rude\nproduce of the soil. If the free importation of foreign manufactures were\npermitted, several of the home manufactures would probably suffer, and\nsome of them, perhaps, go to ruin altogether, and a considerable part of\nthe stock and industry at present employed in them would be forced to\nfind out some other employment. But the freest importation of the rude\nproduce of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the\ncountry.\n992 [17] Iftheimportationofforeigncattle,forexample,weremadeeversofree,\nso few could be imported that the grazing trade of Great Britain could be\nlittle affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of which\nthe transportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By land they\ncarry themselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but their food\nand their water too, must be carried at no small expense and inconveni-\nency. The short sea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed, renders\nthe importation of Irish cattle more easy. But though the free import-\nation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time, were\nrendered perpetual, it could have no considerable effect upon the interest\nofthegraziersofGreatBritain. ThosepartsofGreatBritainwhichborder\nupon the Irish Sea are all grazing countries. Irish cattle could never be G.ed.p460\nimported for their use, but must be driven through those very extensive\ncountries,atnosmallexpenseandinconveniency,beforetheycouldarrive\nat their proper market. Fat cattle could not be driven so far. Lean cattle,\ntherefore, only could be imported, and such importation could interfere,\nnotwiththeinterestofthefeedingorfatteningcountries,towhich,byre-\nducing the price of lean cattle, it would rather be advantageous, but with\nthatofthebreedingcountriesonly. ThesmallnumberofIrishcattleimpor-\n352", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntedsincetheirimportationwaspermitted,togetherwiththegoodpriceat\nwhich lean cattle still continue to sell, seem to demonstratethat even the\nbreeding countries of Great Britain are never likely to be much affected\nby the free importation of Irish cattle. The common people of Ireland, in-\ndeed,aresaidtohavesometimesopposedwithviolencetheexportationof\ntheir cattle. But if the exporters had found any great advantage in con-\ntinuing the trade, they could easily, when the law was on their side, have\nconqueredthismobbishopposition.\n993 [18] Feeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly im-\nproved, whereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The high\npriceofleancattle,byaugmentingthevalueofuncultivatedland,islikea\nbounty against improvement. To any country which was highly improved\nthroughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than\nto breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is said to follow this\nmaxim at present. The mountains of Scotland, Wales, and Northumber-\nland, indeed, are countries not capable of much improvement, and seem\ndestinedbynaturetobethebreedingcountriesofGreatBritain. Thefreest\nimportationofforeigncattlecouldhavenoothereffectthantohinderthose\nbreedingcountriesfromtakingadvantageoftheincreasingpopulationand\nimprovementoftherestofthekingdom, fromraisingtheirpricetoanex-\norbitantheight,andfromlayingarealtaxuponallthemoreimprovedand\ncultivatedpartsofthecountry.\n994 [19] The freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could\nhave as little effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain as\nthat of live cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity,\nbut when compared with fresh meat, they are a commodity both of worse\nquality, and as they cost more labour and expense, of higher price. They\ncould never, therefore, come into competition with the fresh meat, though\ntheymightwiththesaltprovisionsofthecountry.

Butasthebountyuponcornoccasionsagreaterexportation\nin years of plenty, so it must of consequence occasion a greater importa-\ntioninyearsofscarcitythanintheactualstateoftillagewouldotherwise\ntake place.

Thecorn-merchants,thefetchersandcarriersofcorn\nbetween Great Britain and foreign countries would have much less em-\nployment, and might suffer considerably; but the country gentlemen and\nfarmers could suffer very little. It is in the corn merchants accordingly,\nrather than in the country gentlemen and farmers, that I have observed\nthegreatestanxietyfortherenewalandcontinuationofthebounty.\n996 [21] Countrygentlemenandfarmersare,totheirgreathonour,ofallpeople,\nthe least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a\ngreatmanufactoryissometimesalarmedifanotherworkofthesamekind\nis established within twenty miles of him. The Dutch undertaker of the\nwoollen manufacture at Abbeville, stipulated that no work of the same G.ed.p462\nkindshouldbeestablishedwithinthirtyleaguesofthatcity. Farmersand\ncountry gentlemen, on the contrary, are generally disposed rather to pro-\nmotethantoobstructthecultivationandimprovementoftheirneighbours\u2019\nfarms and estates.

ThedefenceofGreatBritain,forexample,depends\nverymuchuponthenumberofitssailorsandshipping. TheActofNavig-\nation,therefore,veryproperlyendeavourstogivethesailorsandshipping\nof Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country in some\ncases by absolute prohibitions and in others by heavy burdens upon the\nshipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal dispositions\nofthisAct.\n1000 [25] First, all ships, of which the owners and three-fourths of the mariners\nare not British subjects, are prohibited, upon pain of forfeiting ship and\ncargo, from trading to the British settlements and plantations, or from\nbeingemployedinthecoastingtradeofGreatBritain.\n1001 [26] Secondly, a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can\nbe brought into Great Britain only, either in such ships as are above de-\nscribed,orinshipsofthecountrywherethosegoodsarepurchased,andof\nwhich the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the mariners are of that\nparticular country; and when imported even in ships of this latter kind,\nthey are subject to double aliens\u2019 duty. If imported in ships of any other\ncountry, the penalty is forfeiture of ship and goods. When this act was\nmade, the Dutch were, what they still are, the great carriers of Europe,\nandbythisregulationtheywereentirelyexcludedfrombeingthecarriers\ntoGreatBritain,orfromimportingtousthegoodsofanyotherEuropean\ncountry.\n1002 [27] Thirdly, a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are\nprohibited from being imported, even in British ships, from any country\nbut that in which they are produced, under pains of forfeiting ship and\ncargo. Thisregulation,too,wasprobablyintendedagainsttheDutch. Hol-\nlandwasthen,asnow,thegreatemporiumforallEuropeangoods,andby\nthis regulation British ships were hindered from loading in Holland the\ngoodsofanyotherEuropeancountry.\n1003 [28] Fourthly, salt fish of all kinds, whale-fins, whale-bone, oil, and blub-\nber,notcaughtbyandcuredonboardBritishvessels,whenimportedinto G.ed.p464\nGreatBritain,aresubjectedtodoublealiens\u2019duty. TheDutch,astheyare\ntheytheprincipal,werethentheonlyfishersinEuropethatattemptedto\nsupply foreign nations with fish. By this regulation, a very heavy burden\nwaslaidupontheirsupplyingGreatBritain.\n1004 [29] When the Act of Navigation was made, though England and Holland\nwere not actually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between\nthe two nations. It had begun during the government of the Long Parlia-\nment,whichfirstframedthisact,anditbrokeoutsoonafterintheDutch\n355", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwars during that of the Protector and of Charles the Second. It is not im-\npossible, therefore, that some of the regulations of this famous act may\nhave proceeded from national animosity. They are as wise, however, as if\ntheyhadallbeendictatedbythemostdeliberatewisdom.

The Act of Navigation, it is true, lays no burden upon\nforeign ships that come to export the produce of British industry. Even\nthe ancient aliens\u2019 duty, which used to be paid upon all goods exported\nas well as imported, has, by several subsequent acts, been taken off from\nthe greater part of the articles of exportation. But if foreigners, either by\nprohibitions or high duties, are hindered from coming to sell, they cannot\nalways afford to come to buy; because coming without a cargo, they must\nlose the freight from their own country to Great Britain. By diminishing\nthe number of sellers, therefore, we necessarily diminish that of buyers,\nandarethuslikelynotonlytobuyforeigngoodsdearer,buttosellourown\ncheaper, than if there was a more perfect freedom of trade.

InGreatBritain,\nwhenanysuchtaxislaidupontheproduceofdomesticindustry,itisusual\nat the same time, in order to stop the clamorous complaints of our mer-\nchants and manufacturers that they will be undersold at home, to lay a\nmuch heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the same\nkind.\n356", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n1007 [32] Thissecondlimitationofthefreedomoftradeaccordingtosomepeople\nshould, upon some occasions, be extended much farther than to the pre-\ncise foreign commodities which could come into competition with those\nwhich had been taxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been\ntaxedanycountry,itbecomesproper,theypretend,totaxnotonlythelike\nnecessaries of life imported from other countries, but all sorts of foreign\ngoods which can come into competition with anything that is the produce\nofdomesticindustry.

Everycommodity,therefore,which\nis the produce of domestic industry, though not immediately taxed itself,\nbecomes dearer in consequence of such taxes, because the labour which\nproduces it becomes so. Such taxes, therefore, are really equivalent, they\nsay,toataxuponeveryparticularcommodityproducedathome. Inorder\nto put domestic upon the same footing with foreign industry, therefore, it G.ed.p466\nbecomes necessary, they think, to lay some duty upon every foreign com-\nmodity equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities\nwithwhichitcancomeintocompetition.\n1008 [33] Whethertaxesuponthenecessariesoflife,suchasthoseinGreatBri-\ntain upon soap, salt, leather, candles, etc., necessarily raise the price of\nlabour, and consequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider\nhereafterwhenIcometotreatoftaxes.

No other countries could support so great\na disorder. As the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy health un-\nder an unwholesome regimen; so the nations only, that in every sort of\nindustry have the greatest natural and acquired advantages can subsist G.ed.p467\nand prosper under such taxes. Holland is the country in Europe in which\nthey abound most, and which from peculiar circumstances continues to\nprosper, not by means of them, as has been most absurdly supposed, but\ninspiteofthem.\n1012 [37] Astherearetwocasesinwhichitwillgenerallybeadvantageoustolay\nsome burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so\ntherearetwoothersinwhichitmaysometimesbeamatterofdeliberation;\nin the one, how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain\nforeign goods; and in the other, how far, or in what manner, it may be\nproper to restore that free importation after it has been for some time\ninterrupted.\n1013 [38] The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how\nfar it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods\nis, when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or prohibitions the\nimportation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge in\nthis case naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the\nlike duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their\nmanufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in\nthis manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their\nownmanufacturesbyrestrainingtheimportationofsuchforeigngoodsas\ncould come into competition with them. In this consisted a great part of\nthe policy of Mr. Colbert, who, notwithstanding his great abilities, seems\ninthiscasetohavebeenimposeduponbythesophistryofmerchantsand\nmanufacturers,whoarealwaysdemandingamonopolyagainsttheircoun-\ntrymen. It is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in France\nthat his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his country.\nThatminister,bythetariffof1667,imposedveryhighdutiesuponagreat\nnumber of foreign manufactures.

Thewarof1672seemstohavebeen\ninpartoccasionedbythiscommercialdispute. ThepeaceofNimeguenput\nan end to it in 1678 by moderating some of those duties in favour of the\nDutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was about the\nsame time that the French and English began mutually to oppress each\n358", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nother\u2019s industry by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the French, G.ed.p468\nhowever, seem to have set the first example. The spirit of hostility which\nhas subsisted between the two nations ever since has hitherto hindered\nthemfrombeingmoderatedoneitherside. In1697theEnglishprohibited\nthe importation of bonelace, the manufacture of Flanders. The govern-\nmentofthatcountry,atthattimeunderthedominionofSpain,prohibited\nin return the importation of English woollens. In 1700, the prohibition\nof importing bonelace into England was taken off upon condition that the\nimportance of English woollens into Flanders should be put on the same\nfootingasbefore.\n1014 [39] There may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a\nprobability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibi-\ntionscomplainedof. Therecoveryofagreatforeignmarketwillgenerally\nmorethancompensatethetransitoryinconveniencyofpayingdearerdur-\ningashorttimeforsomesortsofgoods.

Everysuchlaw,therefore,im-\nposes a real tax upon the whole country, not in favour of that particular\nclass of workmen who were injured by our neighbours\u2019 prohibition, but of\nsomeotherclass.\n1015 [40] The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how\nfar,orinwhatmanneritispropertorestorethefreeimportationofforeign G.ed.p469\ngoods,afterithasbeenforsometimeinterrupted,is,whenparticularman-\nufactures, by means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign goods\nwhichcancomeintocompetitionwiththem, havebeensofarextendedas\ntoemployagreatmultitudeofhands.

By\nthe reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war, more than\na hundred thousand soldiers and seamen, a number equal to what is em-\nployed in the greatest manufactures, were all at once thrown out of their\nordinaryemployment;but,thoughtheynodoubtsufferedsomeinconveni-\nency, they were not thereby deprived of all employment and subsistence.\nThegreaterpartoftheseamen,itisprobable,graduallybetookthemselves G.ed.p470\nto the merchant-service as they could find occasion, and in the meantime\nboth they and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people,\nand employed in a great variety of occupations.

Application\nand industry have been familiar to the one; idleness and dissipation to\n360", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe other. But it is surely much easier to change the direction of industry\nfrom one sort of labour to another than to turn idleness and dissipation\nto any.

If the wines of France are better and\ncheaper than those of Portugal, or its linens than those of Germany, it\nwould be more advantageous for Great Britain to purchase both the wine\nand the foreign linen which it had occasion for of France than of Portugal\nand Germany. Though the value of the annual importations from France\nwould thereby be greatly augmented, the value of the whole annual im-\nportations would be diminished, in proportion as the French goods of the\nsame quality were cheaper than those of the other two countries. This\nwouldbethecase,evenuponthesuppositionthatthewholeFrenchgoods\nimportedweretobeconsumedinGreatBritain.\n1023 [3] But,secondly,agreatpartofthemmightbere-exportedtoothercoun-\ntries, where, being sold with profit, they might bring back a return equal\nin value, perhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French goods imported.\nWhat has frequently been said of the East India trade might possibly be\ntrue of the French; that though the greater part of East India goods were\nbought with gold and silver, the re-exportation of a part of them to other\ncountries brought back more gold and silver to that which carried on the\ntrade than the prime cost of the whole amounted to. One of the most im-\nportantbranchesoftheDutchtrade,atpresent,consistsinthecarriageof\nFrench goods to other European countries. Some part even of the French\nwine drank in Great Britain is clandestinely imported from Holland and\nZeeland. If there was either a free trade between France and England,\n364", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\norifFrenchgoodscouldbeimporteduponpayingonlythesamedutiesas\nthoseofotherEuropeannations,tobedrawnbackuponexportation,Eng-\nland might have some share of a trade which is found so advantageous to\nHolland.\n1024 [4] Thirdly,andlastly,thereisnocertaincriterionbywhichwecandeterm-\nineonwhichsidewhatiscalledthebalancebetweenanytwocountrieslies,\norwhichofthemexportstothegreatestvalue. Nationalprejudiceandan-\nimosity,promptedalwaysbytheprivateinterestofparticulartraders,are\ntheprincipleswhichgenerallydirectourjudgmentuponallquestionscon-\ncerning it. There are two criterions, however, which have frequently been\nappealedtouponsuchoccasions,thecustomhousebooksandthecourseof\nexchange. The custom-house books, I think, it is now generally acknow- G.ed.p476\nledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of the inaccuracy of the\nvaluationatwhichthegreaterpartofgoodsareratedinthem. Thecourse\nofexchangeis,perhaps,almostequallyso.\n1025 [5] When the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is\nat par, it is said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are\ncompensated by those due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when\na premium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign\nthat the debts due from London to Paris are not compensated by those\ndue from Paris to London, but that a balance in money must be sent out\nfromthelatterplace;fortherisk,trouble,andexpenseofexportingwhich,\nthe premium is both demanded and given. But the ordinary state of debt\nand credit between those two cities must necessarily be regulated, it is\nsaid, by the ordinary course of their dealings with one another. When\nneitherofthemimportsfromtheothertoagreateramountthanitexports\nto that other, the debts and credits of each may compensate one another.\nBut when one of them imports from the other to a greater value than it\nexportstothatother,theformernecessarilybecomesindebtedtothelatter\nin a greater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it; the debts and\ncreditsofeachdonotcompensateoneanother,andmoneymustbesentout\nfrom that place of which the debts overbalance the credits.

Theordinarystateofdebtandcreditbetweenanytwoplacesisnot G.ed.p477\nalwaysentirelyregulatedbytheordinarycourseoftheirdealingswithone\nanother;butisofteninfluencedbythatofthedealingsofeitherwithmany\nother places.

The banks of Venice, Genoa, Am-\nsterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all originally es-\ntablished with this view, though some of them may have afterwards been\nmadesubservienttootherpurposes.

Such money no sooner appeared than it was melted down\nor carried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The merchants,\nwithplentyofcurrency,couldnotalwaysfindasufficientquantityofgood\nmoney to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of those bills, in spite\nof several regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a great\nmeasureuncertain.\n1035 [4] In order to remedy these inconveniences, a bank was established in\n1609undertheguaranteeofthecity.

For the value which remained, after this small deduc-\ntion was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called bank\nmoney, which, as it represented money exactly according to the standard\nof the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically worth\nmore than current money. It was at the same time enacted, that all bills\ndrawnuponornegotiatedatAmsterdamofthevalueofsixhundredguild-\ners and upwards should be paid in bank money, which at once took away\nalluncertaintyinthevalueofthosebills.

Over and\nabove all this, it could not be brought from those coffers, as it will appear\nbyandby,withoutpreviouslypayingforthekeeping.\n1037 [6] Those deposits of coin, or those deposits which the bank was bound to\nrestore in coin, constituted the original capital of the bank, or the whole\nvalue of what was represented by what is called bank money. At present G.ed.p482\nthey are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In order to\nfacilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these many years in\nthe practice of giving credit in its books upon deposits of gold and silver\nbullion. Thiscreditisgenerallyaboutfivepercentbelowthemintpriceof\nsuch bullion. The bank grants at the same time what is called a recipe or\nreceipt, entitlingthepersonwhomakesthedeposit, orthebearer, totake\nout the bullion again at any time within six months, upon re-transferring\nto the bank a quantity of bank money equal to that for which credit had\nbeengiveninitsbookswhenthedepositwasmade,anduponpayingone-\nfourth per cent for the keeping, if the deposit was in silver; and one-half\nper cent if it was in gold; but at the same time declaring that, in default\nofsuchpayment, andupontheexpirationofthisterm, thedepositshould\nbelongtothebankatthepriceatwhichithadbeenreceived,orforwhich\ncredit had been given in the transfer books.

The receipt and the\nbank credit seldom keep long together, and there is no occasion that they\nshould.

But the agio of the\nbank being now generally about five per cent such receipts are frequently\nallowed to expire, or as they express it, to fall to the bank. The receipts\nwhich are given for deposits of gold ducats fall to it yet more frequently,\nbecause a higher warehouse-rent, or one-half per cent must be paid for\nthe keeping of them before they can be taken out again.

France would in this case carry on a direct foreign trade of con-\nsumption with England; whereas England would carry on a round-about\ntrade of the same kind with France. The different effects of a capital em-\nployed in the direct and of one employed in the round-about foreign trade\nofconsumptionhavealreadybeenfullyexplained.\n1054 [6] There is not, probably, between any two countries a trade which con-\nsistsaltogetherintheexchangeeitherofnativecommoditiesonbothsides,\norofnativecommoditiesononesideandofforeigngoodsontheother.

The trade, however,\nwould, in this case, as in the foregoing, give some revenue to the inhabit-\nants of both countries, but more to those of France than to those of Eng-\n377", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nland. It would give some revenue to those of England. The capital which\nhad been employed in producing the English goods that purchased this\ngold and silver, the capital which had been distributed among, and given\nrevenueto,certaininhabitantsofEngland,wouldtherebybereplacedand\nenabledtocontinuethatemployment.

I answer, that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a\n378", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlosing trade. In its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other,\nthoughperhapssomewhatmoreliabletobeabused. Theemploymentofa G.ed.p492\nbrewer, and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as necessary\ndivisions of labour as any other. It will generally be more advantageous\nfor a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occasion for than\nto brew it himself, and if he is a poor workman, it will generally be more\nadvantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer than a\nlarge quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of either, as\nhe may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood, of the butcher, if he is\na glutton, or of the draper, if he affects to be a beau among his compan-\nions. It is advantageous to the great body of workmen, notwithstanding,\nthatallthesetradesshouldbefree,thoughthisfreedommaybeabusedin\nall of them, and is more likely to be so, perhaps, in some than in others.\nThoughindividuals,besides,maysometimesruintheirfortunesbyanex-\ncessiveconsumptionoffermentedliquors,thereseemstobenoriskthata\nnation should do so. Though in every country there are many people who\nspenduponsuchliquorsmorethantheycanafford,therearealwaysmany\nmore who spend less. It deserves to be remarked too, that, if we consult\nexperience, the cheapness of wine seems to be a cause, not of drunken-\nness, but of sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are in general\nthe soberest people in Europe; witness the Spainards, the Italians, and\nthe inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People are seldom\nguilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects the character\nof liberality and good fellowship by being profuse of a liquor which is as\ncheap as small beer. On the contrary, in the countries which, either from\nexcessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where wine consequently\nis dear and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as among the north-\nern nations, and all those who live between the tropics, the negroes, for\nexample, on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment comes from\nsomeofthenorthernprovincesofFrance,wherewineissomewhatdear,to\nbe quartered in the southern, where it is very cheap, the soldiers, I have\nfrequently heard it observed are at first debauched by the cheapness and\nnovelty of good wine; but after a few months\u2019 residence, the greater part\nof them become as sober as the rest of the inhabitants. Were the duties\nupon foreign wines, and the excises upon malt, beer, and ale to be taken\naway all at once, it might, in the same manner, occasion in Great Britain\napretty general andtemporarydrunkennessamongthe middlingandin-\nferiorranksofpeople,whichwouldprobablybesoonfollowedbyaperman-\nentandalmostuniversalsobriety. Atpresentdrunkennessisbynomeans G.ed.p493\nthe vice of people of fashion, or of those who can easily afford the most\nexpensive liquors. A gentleman drunk with ale has scarce ever been seen\namong us. The restraints upon the wine trade in Great Britain, besides,\ndo not so much seem calculated to hinder the people from going, if I may\nsay so, to the alehouse, as from going where they can buy the best and\ncheapest liquor. They favour the wine trade of Portugal, and discourage\n379", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthat of France. The Portugese, it is said, indeed, are better customers for\nour manufactures than the French, and should therefore be encouraged\nin preference to them. As they give us their custom, it is pretended, we\nshouldgivethemours.

In every country it\nalways is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy\nwhatevertheywantofthosewhosellitcheapest.

In a state of hostil-\n380", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nity it may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to\nour own; but in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable\nthemtoexchangewithustoagreatervalue,andtoaffordabettermarket,\neither for the immediate produce of our own industry, or for whatever is\npurchased with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better cus-\ntomer to the industrious people in his neighbourhood than a poor, so is\nlikewisearichnation. Arichman,indeed,whoishimselfamanufacturer,\nis a very dangerous neighbour to all those who deal in the same way. All\ntherestoftheneighbourhood, however, byfarthegreatestnumber, profit\nby the good market which his expense affords them. They even profit by\nhisundersellingthepoorerworkmenwhodealinthesamewaywithhim.\nThe manufacturers of a rich nation, in the same manner, may no doubt\nbe very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbours. This very competi-\ntion, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people, who profit\ngreatly besides by the good market which the great expense of such a na-\ntion affords them in every other way. Private people who want to make\na fortune never think of retiring to the remote and poor provinces of the\ncountry,butresorteithertothecapital,ortosomeofthegreatcommercial\ntowns. They know that where little wealth circulates there is little to be\ngot, but that where a great deal is in motion, some share of it may fall to\nthem. The same maxims which would in this manner direct the common\nsense of one, or ten, or twenty individuals, should regulate the judgment\nof one, or ten, or twenty millions, and should make a wholenation regard\nthe riches of its neighbours as a probable cause and occasion for itself to G.ed.p495\nacquire riches. A nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade is cer-\ntainly most likely to do so when its neighbours are all rich, industrious,\nand commercial nations. A great nation surrounded on all sides by wan-\nderingsavagesandpoorbarbariansmight,nodoubt,acquirerichesbythe\ncultivation of its own lands, and by its own interior commerce, but not\nby foreign trade. It seems to have been in this manner that the ancient\nEgyptians and the modern Chinese acquired their great wealth. The an-\ncient Egyptians, it is said, neglected foreign commerce, and the modern\nChinese, it is known, bold it in the utmost contempt, and scarce deign to\nafford it the decent protection of the laws. The modern maxims of foreign\ncommerce, by aiming at the impoverishment of all our neighbours, so far\nastheyarecapableofproducingtheirintendedeffect,tendtorenderthat\nverycommerceinsignificantandcontemptible.\n1060 [12] ItisinconsequenceofthesemaximsthatthecommercebetweenFrance\nand England has in both countries been subjected to so many discourage-\nments and restraints.

Itwould\nbe, at least, three times more advantageous than the boasted trade with\nour North American colonies, in which the returns were seldom made in\nlessthanthreeyears,frequentlynotinlessthanfourorfiveyears.

Thisisthebalanceoftheannualpro-\nduce and consumption.

Theircountryhasnojurisdictioninforeignnations,andthere-\nfore can seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally\nobliged, therefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain en-\ncouragementstoexportation.\n1067 [2] Of these encouragements what are called Drawbacks seem to be the\nmost reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation,\neither the whole or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed\nupon domestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater\nquantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been\nimposed.

They tend not to destroy, but to preserve what it is in most\ncases advantageous to preserve, the natural division and distribution of\nlabourinthesociety.\n1068 [3] The same thing may be said of the drawbacks upon the re-exportation\nof foreign goods imported, which in Great Britain generally amount to by\nmuch the largest part of the duty upon importation. By the second of\nthe rules annexed to the Act of Parliament which imposed what is now\ncalled the Old Subsidy, every merchant, whether English or alien, was\nallowed to draw back half that duty upon exportation; the English mer-\nchant,providedtheexportationtookplacewithintwelvemonths;thealien,\nprovided it took place within nine months. Wines, currants, and wrought\nsilks were the only goods which did not fall within this rule, having other\nand more advantageous allowances. The duties imposed by this Act of\nParliament were at that time the only duties upon the importation of for-\neign goods. The term within which this and all other drawbacks could be\nclaimed was afterwards (by the 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. sect. 10.) extended to G.ed.p500\nthreeyears.", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n1069 [4] The duties which have been imposed since the Old Subsidy are, the\ngreater part of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general\nrule,however,isliabletoagreatnumberofexceptions,andthedoctrineof\ndrawbackshasbecomeamuchlesssimplematterthanitwasattheirfirst\ninstitution.\n1070 [5] Upon the exportation of some foreign goods, of which it was expected\nthat the importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the\nhome consumption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining\nevenhalftheOldSubsidy.

They may,\nhowever, upon paying certain duties, be imported and warehoused for ex-\nportation. But upon such exportation, no part of these duties are drawn\nback. Ourmanufacturersareunwilling,itseems,thateventhisrestricted\nimportation should be encouraged, and are afraid lest some part of these\ngoods should be stolen out of the warehouse, and thus come into compet-\nition with their own. It is under these regulations only that we can im-\nport wrought silks, French cambrics and lawns, calicoes painted, printed,\nstainedordyed,etc.\n1073 [8] We are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose\nrather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those, whom we con-\nsider as our enemies, to make any profit by our means.

Theyseem,\nhowever, to have found some difficulty in importing European wines from\ntheplacesoftheirgrowth,andtheycouldnotwellimportthemfromGreat\nBritain where they were loaded with many heavy duties, of which a con-\nsiderable part was not drawn back upon exportation. Maderia wine, not\nbeingaEuropeancommodity,couldbeimporteddirectlyintoAmericaand\nthe West Indies, countries which, in all their non-enumerated commodit-\nies, enjoyed a free trade to the island of Maderia. These circumstances\nhad probably introduced that general taste for Maderia wine, which our\nofficers found established in all our colonies at the commencement of the\nwar, which began in 1755, and which they brought back with them to the G.ed.p503\nmother country, where that wine had not been much in fashion before.\nUpon the conclusion of that war, in 1763 (by the 4th Geo. III. chap. 15.\nsect. 12.), all the duties, except 3l.10s. were allowed to be drawn back\nupon the exportation to the colonies of all wines, except French wines, to\nthe commerce and consumption of which national prejudice would allow\nno sort of encouragement.

But though the carrying trade certainly\ndeserves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the institution\nwas perhaps abundantly foolish, the institution itself seems reasonable\nenough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater share of\nthe capital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own ac-\ncord had there been no duties upon importation. They only prevent its\nbeing excluded altogether by those duties. The carrying trade, though it\ndeserves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but to be left free like\nallothertrades. Itisanecessaryresourceforthosecapitalswhichcannot\nfind employment either in the agriculture or in the manufactures of the\ncountry,eitherinitshometradeorinitsforeigntradeofconsumption.\n1078 [13] The revenue of the customs, instead of suffering, profits from such\ndrawbacks by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole du-\nties had been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid could\nseldomhavebeenexported,norconsequentlyimported,forwantofamar-\nket. The duties, therefore, of which a part is retained would never have\nbeenpaid.\n1079 [14] These reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks, and would jus-\ntifythem,thoughthewholeduties,whetherupontheproduceofdomestic\nindustry,oruponforeigngoods,werealwaysdrawnbackuponexportation. G.ed.p504\nThe revenue of excise would in this case, indeed, suffer a little, and that\nof the customs a good deal more; but the natural balance of industry, the\nnatural division and distribution of labour, which is always more or less\ndisturbed by such duties, would be more nearly re-established by such a\nregulation.\n1080 [15] These reasons, however, will justify drawbacks only upon exporting\ngoods to those countries which are altogether foreign and independent,\nnot to those in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a mono-\npoly. A drawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods\nto our American colonies will not always occasion a greater exportation\nthan what would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly\nwhich our merchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the same quantity\n388", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmight frequently, perhaps, be sent thither, though the whole duties were\nretained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure loss to the\nrevenue of excise and customs, without altering the state of the trade, or\nrendering it in any respect more extensive. How far such drawbacks can\nbe justified, as a proper encouragement to the industry of our colonies, or\nhow far it is advantageous to the mother country, that they should be ex-\nempted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their fellow subjects,\nwillappearhereafterwhenIcometotreatthecolonies.\n1081 [16] Drawbacks, however, it must always be understood, are useful only\nin those cases in which the goods for the exportation of which they are\ngiven are really exported to some foreign country; and not clandestinely\nre-imported into our own. That some drawbacks, particularly those upon\ntobacco, have frequently been abused in this manner, and have given oc-\ncasion to many frauds equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair\ntrader,iswellknown.\n389", "CHAPTER V\nG.ed.p505\nOF BOUNTIES\n1082 [1] BOUNTIES upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently petitioned\nfor, and sometimes granted to the produce of particular branches of do-\nmestic industry. By means of them our merchants and manufacturers, it\nis pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap, or cheaper than\ntheir rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is said, will thus\nbeexported, and the balanceoftradeconsequently turned moreinfavour\nofourowncountry. Wecannotgiveourworkmenamonopolyintheforeign\nas we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to buy\ntheir goods as we have done our own countrymen. The next best expedi-\nent, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this\nmanner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole country,\nandtoputmoneyintoallourpocketsbymeansofthebalanceoftrade.\n1083 [2] Bounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of trade\nonly which cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade\ninwhichthemerchantcansellhisgoodsforapricewhichreplacestohim,\nwiththeordinaryprofitsofstock,thewholecapitalemployedinpreparing\nand sending them to market, can be carried on without a bounty.

That the average price of corn began to\nfall somewhat towards the end of the last century, and has continued to\ndo so during the course of the sixty-four first years of the present, I have\nalreadyendeavouredtoshow. Butthisevent,supposingittobeasrealas G.ed.p507\nI believe it to be, must have happened in spite of the bounty, and cannot\npossibly have happened in consequence of it. It has happened in France,\naswellasinEngland,thoughinFrancetherewasnotonlynobounty,but,\ntill 1764, the exportation of corn was subjected to a general prohibition.\nThis gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable, therefore,\nis ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the other. but to\nthat gradual and insensible rise in the real value of silver, which, in the\nfirstbookinthisdiscourse,Ihaveendeavouredtoshowhastakenplacein\nthe general market of Europe during the course of the present century. It\nseemstobealtogetherimpossiblethatthebountycouldevercontributeto\nlowerthepriceofgrain.\n1087 [6] Inyearsofplenty,ithasalreadybeenobserved,thebounty,byoccasion-\ninganextraordinaryexportation,necessarilykeepsupthepriceofcornin\nthe home market above what it would naturally fall to. To do so was the\navowed purpose of the institution. In years of scarcity, though the bounty\n391", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis frequently suspended, yet the great exportation which it occasions in\nyearsofplentymustfrequentlyhindermoreorlesstheplentyofoneyear\nfromrelievingthescarcityofanother. Bothinyearsofplentyandinyears\nofscarcity,therefore,thebountynecessarilytendstoraisethemoneyprice\nofcornsomewhathigherthanitotherwisewouldbeinthehomemarket.\n1088 [7] That, in the actual state of tillage, the bounty must necessarily have\nthis tendency will not, I apprehend, be disputed by any reasonable per-\nson. But it has been thought by many people that it tends to encourage\ntillage, and that in two different ways; first, by opening a more extensive\nforeignmarkettothecornofthefarmer,ittends,theyimagine,toincrease\nthe demand for, and consequently the production of that commodity; and\nsecondly,bysecuringtohimabetterpricethanhecouldotherwiseexpect\nin the actual state of tillage, it tends, they suppose, to encourage tillage.\nThis double encouragement must, they imagine, in a long period of years,\noccasion such an increase in the production of corn as may lower its price G.ed.p508\ninthehomemarketmuchmorethanthebountycanraiseit,intheactual\nstatewhichtillagemay,attheendofthatperiod,happentobein.\n1089 [8] I answer, that whatever extension of the foreign market can be occa-\nsioned by the bounty must, in every particular year, be altogether at the\nexpense of the home market; as every bushel of corn which is exported\nbymeansofthebounty, andwhichwouldnothavebeenexportedwithout\nthebounty,wouldhaveremainedinthehomemarkettoincreasethecon-\nsumption and to lower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is\nto be observed, as well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes\ntwodifferenttaxesuponthepeople;first,thetaxwhichtheyareobligedto\ncontribute in order to pay the bounty; and secondly, the tax which arises\nfromtheadvancedpriceofthecommodityinthehomemarket,andwhich,\nasthewholebodyofthepeoplearepurchasersofcorn,must,inthispartic-\nularcommodity,bepaidbythewholebodyofthepeople. Inthisparticular\ncommodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the heavier of the two.\nLetussupposethat,takingoneyearwithanother,thebountyoffiveshil-\nlings upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat raises the price of that\ncommodityinthehomemarketonlysixpencethebushel, orfourshillings\nthe quarter, higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state\nof the crop. Even upon this very moderate supposition, the great body of\nthe people, over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of\nfive shillings upon every quarter of wheat exported, must pay another of\nfourshillingsuponeveryquarterwhichtheythemselvesconsume. But,ac-\ncordingtotheverywellinformedauthorofthetractsuponthecorntrade,\nthe average proportion of the corn exported to that consumed at home is\nnotmorethanthatofonetothirty-one. Foreveryfiveshillings,therefore,\nwhichtheycontributetothepaymentofthefirsttax,theymustcontribute\nsixpoundsfourshillingstothepaymentofthesecond. Soveryheavyatax\nupon the first necessary of life must either reduce the subsistence of the\nlabouring poor, or it must occasion some augmentation in their pecuniary\n392", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwages proportionable to that in the pecuniary price of their subsistence.\nSo far as it operates in the one way, it must reduce the ability of the la-\nbouringpoortoeducateandbringuptheirchildren,andmust,sofar,tend\ntorestrainthepopulationofthecountry. Sofarasitoperatesintheother,\nitmustreducetheabilityoftheemployersofthepoortoemploysogreata\nnumberastheyotherwisemightdo,andmust,sofar,tendtorestrainthe\nindustry of the country. The extraordinary exportation of corn, therefore, G.ed.p509\noccasionedbythebounty,notonly,ineveryparticularyear,diminishesthe\nhome, just as much as it extends the foreign, market and consumption,\nbut, by restraining the population and industry of the country, its final\ntendency is to stunt and restrain the gradual extension of the home mar-\nket;andthereby,inthelongrun,rathertodiminish,thantoaugment,the\nwholemarketandconsumptionofcorn.\n1090 [9] This enhancement of the money price of corn, however, it has been\nthought,byrenderingthatcommoditymoreprofitabletothefarmer,must\nnecessarilyencourageitsproduction.\n1091 [10] I answer, that this might be the case if the effect of the bounty was to\nraise the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer, with an equal quant-\nity of it, to maintain a greater number of labourers in the same manner,\nwhether liberal, moderate, or scanty, that other labourers are commonly\nmaintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is evident,\nnor any other human institution can have any such effect. It is not the\nreal, but the nominal price of corn, which can in any considerable degree\nbe affected by the bounty. And though the tax which that institution im-\nposesuponthewholebodyofthepeoplemaybeveryburdensometothose\nwhopayit,itisofverylittleadvantagetothosewhoreceiveit.\n1092 [11] The real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value of\ncorn as to degrade the real value of silver, or to make an equal quantity\nof it exchange for a smaller quantity, not only of corn, but of all other\nhomemade commodities: for the money price of corn regulates that of all\notherhome-madecommodities.\n1093 [12] Itregulatesthemoneypriceoflabour,whichmustalwaysbesuchasto\nenable the labourer to purchase a quantity of corn sufficient to maintain\nhim and his family either in the liberal, moderate, or scanty manner in\nwhich the advancing, stationary, or declining circumstances of the society\nobligehisemployerstomaintainhim.\n1094 [13] It regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce\nof land, which, in every period of improvement, must bear a certain pro-\nportion to that of corn, though this proportion is different in different\nperiods. It regulates, for example, the money price of grass and hay, of\nbutcher\u2019smeat, ofhorses, andthemaintenanceofhorses, oflandcarriage\nconsequently,orofthegreaterpartoftheinlandcommerceofthecountry.\n1095 [14] Byregulatingthemoneypriceofalltheotherpartsoftherudeproduce G.ed.p510\nof land, it regulates that of the materials of almost all manufactures. By\nregulating the money price of labour, it regulates that of manufacturing\n393", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nartandindustry. Andbyregulatingboth,itregulatesthatofthecomplete\nmanufacture. The money price of labour, and of everything that is the\nproduce either of land or labour, must necessarily either rise or fall in\nproportiontothemoneypriceofcorn.\n1096 [15] Though in consequence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer should be\nenabled to sell his corn for four shillings a bushel instead of three-and-\nsixpence, and to pay his landlord a money rent proportionable to this rise\ninthe moneyprice ofhis produce, yetif, inconsequenceof thisrise inthe\npriceofcorn,fourshillingswillpurchasenomorehomemadegoodsofany\nother kind than three-and-sixpence would have done before, neither the\ncircumstancesofthefarmernorthoseofthelandlordwillbemuchmended\nby this change. The farmer will not be able to cultivate much better: the\nlandlord will not be able to live much better. In the purchase of foreign\ncommodities this enhancement in the price of corn may give them some\nlittleadvantage. Inthatofhome-madecommoditiesitcangivethemnone\nat all. And almost the whole expense of the farmer, and the far greater\npartevenofthatofthelandlord,isinhomemadecommodities.\n1097 [16] Thatdegradationinthevalueofsilverwhichistheeffectofthefertility\nofthemines,andwhichoperatesequally,orverynearequally,throughthe\ngreaterpartofthecommercialworld,isamatterofverylittleconsequence\ntoanyparticularcountry.

Thosemetalsoughtnaturally, therefore, tobesomewhatcheaper\nin Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe. The difference, G.ed.p511\nhowever,shouldbenomorethantheamountofthefreightandinsurance;\nand, on account of the great value and small bulk of those metals, their\nfreight is no great matter, and their insurance is the same as that of any\nothergoodsofequalvalue. SpainandPortugal,therefore,couldsuffervery\nlittlefromtheirpeculiarsituation,iftheydidnotaggravateitsdisadvant-\nagesbytheirpoliticalinstitutions.\n1100 [19] Spain by taxing, and Portugal by prohibiting the exportation of gold\n394", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nandsilver,loadthatexportationwiththeexpenseofsmuggling,andraise\nthe value of those metals in other countries so much more above what it\nis in their own by the whole amount of this expense. When you dam up a\nstream of water, as soon as the dam is full as much water must run over\nthedam-headasiftherewasnodamatall. Theprohibitionofexportation\ncannot detain a greater quantity of gold and silver in Spain and Portugal\nthan what they can afford to employ, than what the annual produce of\ntheirlandandlabourwillallowthemtoemploy,incoin,plate,gilding,and\nother ornaments of gold and silver.

G.ed.p512\nTheannualexportationofgoldandsilverfromSpainandPortugalaccord-\ninglyis,byallaccounts,notwithstandingtheserestraints,verynearequal\nto the whole annual importation. As the water, however, must always be\ndeeper behind the dam-head than before it, so the quantity of gold and\nsilver which these restraints detain in Spain and Portugal must, in pro-\nportion to the annual produce of their land and labour, be greater than\nwhat is to be found in other countries. The higher and stronger the dam-\nhead,thegreatermustbethedifferenceinthedepthofwaterbehindand\nbeforeit. Thehigherthetax,thehigherthepenaltieswithwhichthepro-\nhibition is guarded, the more vigilant and severe the police which looks\nafter the execution of the law, the greater must be the difference in the\nproportionofgoldandsilvertotheannualproduceofthelandandlabour\nofSpainandPortugal,andtothatofothercountries. Itissaidaccordingly\nto be very considerable, and that you frequently find there a profusion of\nplate in houses where there is nothing else which would, in other coun-\ntries, be thought suitable or correspondent to this sort of magnificence.\nThe cheapness of gold and silver, or what is the same thing, the dear-\nness of all commodities, which is the necessary effect of this redundancy\nofthepreciousmetals,discouragesboththeagricultureandmanufactures\nof Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to supply them with\nmany sorts of rude, and with almost all sorts of manufactured produce,\nfor a smaller quantity of gold and silver than what they themselves can\neither raise or make them for at home. The tax and prohibition operate\nin two different ways. They not only lower very much the value of the G.ed.p513\nprecious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining there a certain\nquantityofthosemetalswhichwouldotherwiseflowoverothercountries,\nthey keep up their value in those other countries somewhat above what\nit otherwise would be, and thereby give those countries a double advant-\nageintheircommercewithSpainandPortugal.

Those goods, too, would not\nbe all matters of mere luxury and expense, to be consumed by idle people\nwho produce nothing in return for their consumption.

The annual produce of their land and labour would immediately\nbe augmented a little, and in a few years would, probably, be augmented\na great deal; their industry being thus relieved from one of the most op-\npressiveburdenswhichitatpresentlaboursunder.\n1101 [20] The bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates exactly\ninthesamewayasthisabsurdpolicyofSpainandPortugal.

But if\nthis money sinks in its value, in the quantity of labour, provisions, and\nhomemade commodities of all different kinds which it is capable of pur-\nchasing as much as it rises in its quantity, the service will be little more\nthannominalandimaginary.\n1103 [22] There is, perhaps, but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to\nwhom the bounty either was or could be essentially serviceable. These\nwerethecornmerchants, theexportersandimportersofcorn.

It is in this set of men, accordingly, that I have\nobservedthegreatestzealforthecontinuanceorrenewalofthebounty.\n1104 [23] Our country gentlemen, when they imposed the high duties upon the\nimportationofforeigncorn,whichintimesofmoderateplentyamounttoa\nprohibition, andwhentheyestablishedthebounty, seemtohaveimitated\nthe conduct of our manufacturers. By the one institution, they secured to\nthemselves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other they en-\ndeavoured to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with their\ncommodity. By both they endeavoured to raise its real value, in the same\nmannerasourmanufacturershad,bythelikeinstitutions,raisedthereal\nvalueofmanydifferentsortsofmanufacturedgoods. Theydidnotperhaps\nattend to the great and essential difference which nature has established\nbetween corn and almost every other sort of goods. When, either by the\nmonopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon exportation, you en-\nable our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their goods for somewhat\na better price than they otherwise could get for them, you raise, not only\nthenominal,buttherealpriceofthosegoods.

Thenatureofthings\nhasstampeduponcornarealvaluewhichcannotbealteredbymerelyal-\ntering its money price. No bounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the G.ed.p516\nhome market, can raise that value.

It is the real value of silver which varies with\nthem.\n1105 [24] Bountiesupontheexportationofanyhomemadecommodityareliable,\nfirst to that general objection which may be made to all the different ex-\npedients of the mercantile system; the objection of forcing some part of\nthe industry of the country into a channel less advantageous than that in\nwhichitwouldrunofitsownaccord: and,secondly,totheparticularobjec-\ntionofforcingit,notonlyintoachannelthatislessadvantageous,butinto\nonethatisactuallydisadvantageous;thetradewhichcannotbecarriedon\nbut by means of a bounty being necessarily a losing trade. The bounty\nupon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection, that it can\nin no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity of which\nit was meant to encourage the production. When our country gentlemen,\ntherefore,demandedtheestablishmentofthebounty,thoughtheyactedin\nimitationofourmerchantsandmanufacturers, theydidnotactwiththat\ncompletecomprehensionoftheirowninterestwhichcommonlydirectsthe\nconductofthosetwootherordersofpeople.

It would, besides, impose only one tax upon the people,\nthat which they must contribute in order to pay the bounty.

Bountiesuponproduction, however, havebeenveryrarelygran-\nted. The prejudices established by the commercial system have taught\nus to believe that national wealth arises more immediately from exporta-\ntion than from production. It has been more favoured accordingly, as the\nmoreimmediatemeansofbringingmoneyintothecountry. Bountiesupon\nproduction, it has been said too, have been found by experience more li-\nable to frauds than those upon exportation. How far this is true, I know\nnot. Thatbountiesuponexportationhavebeenabusedtomanyfraudulent\npurposes is very well known. But it is not the interest of merchants and\nmanufacturers, the great inventors of all these expedients, that the home\nmarket should be overstocked with their goods, an event which a bounty\nuponproductionmightsometimesoccasion. Abountyuponexportation,by\nenablingthemtosendabroadthesurpluspart,andtokeepupthepriceof\nwhatremainsinthehomemarket,effectuallypreventsthis.

This expedient succeeded so well that it more than doubled\nthe price of their goods in the home market, notwithstanding a very con-\nsiderable increase in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn\nmust have been wonderfully different if it has lowered the money price of\nthatcommodity.\n1107 [26] Something like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted G.ed.p518\nuponsomeparticularoccasions. Thetonnagebountiesgiventothewhite-\nherring and whale fisheries may, perhaps, be considered as somewhat of\nthis nature. They tend directly, it may be supposed, to render the goods\ncheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be. In other re-\nspects their effects, it must be acknowledged, are the same as those of\nbounties upon exportation. By means of them a part of the capital of the\ncountry is employed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does\nnotrepaythecosttogetherwiththeordinaryprofitsofstock.\n1108 [27] Butthoughthetonnagebountiesofthosefisheriesdonotcontributeto\ntheopulenceofthenation,itmayperhapsbethoughtthattheycontribute\ntoitsdefencebyaugmentingthenumberofitssailorsandshipping.

Duringtheseelevenyearsthewholenum-\nber of barrels caught by the herring buss fishery of Scotland amounted to\n378,347. The herrings caught and cured at sea are called sea-sticks. In\norder to render them what are called merchantable herrings, it is neces-\nsarytorepackthemwithanadditionalquantityofsalt;andinthiscase,it\nis reckoned that three barrels of sea-sticks are usually repacked into two\nbarrelsofmerchantableherrings.

It was the old Scotch duty upon a bushel of\nsalt,thequantitywhich,atalowestimation,hadbeensupposednecessary\nfor curing a barrel of herrings. In Scotland, foreign salt is very little used\nfor any other purpose but the curing of fish. But from the 5th April 1771\nto the 5th April 1782, the quantity of foreign salt imported amounted to\n936,974 bushels, at eighty-four pounds the bushel: the quantity of Scotch\nsalt, delivered from the works to the fish-curers, to no more than 168,226,\nat fifty-six pounds the bushel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is\nprincipally foreign salt that is used in the fisheries. Upon every barrel G.ed.p520\nof herrings exported there is, besides, a bounty of 2s.8d., and more than\ntwo-thirds of the buss caught herrings are exported. Put all these things\ntogether and you will find that, during these eleven years, every barrel\nof buss caught herrings, cured with Scotch salt when exported, has cost\ngovernment17s.113d.;andwhenenteredforhomeconsumption14s.33d.;\n4 4\nandthateverybarrelcuredwithforeignsalt,whenexported,hascostgov-\nernment 1l.7s.53d.; and when entered for home consumption 1l.3s.93d.\n4 4\nThe price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen\nand eighteen to four and five and twenty shillings, about a guinea at an\naverage1.\n1113 [32] Secondly, the bounty to the white-herring fishery is a tonnage bounty;\nandisproportionedtotheburdenoftheship,nottoherdiligenceorsuccess\nin the fishery; and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit\nout for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty. In the\n1[Smith]Seetheaccountsoftheendofthevolume.\n400", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nyear 1759, when the bounty was at fifty shillings the ton, the whole buss\nfishery of Scotland brought in only four barrels of sea-sticks.

Holland lies at a great distance from the seas to which\nherringsareknownprincipallytoresort,andcan,therefore,carryonthat\nfishery only in decked vessels, which can carry water and provisions suf-\nficient for a voyage to a distant sea. But the Hebrides or western islands,\ntheislandsofShetland,andthenorthernandnorthwesterncoastsofScot-\nland, the countries in whose neighbourhood the herring fishery is prin-\ncipally carried on, are everywhere intersected by arms of the sea, which\nrun up a considerable way into the land, and which, in the language of\nthe country, are called sea-lochs. It is to these sea-lochs that the herrings G.ed.p521\nprincipallyresortduringtheseasonsinwhichtheyvisitthoseseas;forthe\nvisits of this and, I am assured, of many other sorts of fish are not quite\nregular and constant. A boat fishery, therefore, seems to be the mode of\nfishing best adapted to the peculiar situation of Scotland, the fishers car-\nrying the herrings on shore, as fast as they are taken, to be either cured\norconsumedfresh. Butthegreatencouragementwhichabountyofthirty\nshillings the ton gives to the buss fishery is necessarily a discouragement\nto the boat fishery, which, having no such bounty, cannot bring its cured\nfish to market upon the same terms as the buss fishery. The boat fishery,\naccordingly, which before the establishment of the buss bounty was very\nconsiderable, and is said have employed a number of seamen not inferior\nto what the buss fishery employs at present, is now gone almost entirely\ntodecay.

A bounty,\nwhich tended to lower their price in the home market, might contribute\na good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellow-subjects, whose\ncircumstancesarebynomeansaffluent. Buttheherringbussbountycon-\ntributes to no such good purpose. It has ruined the boat fishery, which is,\nby far, the best adapted for the supply of the home market, and the addi-\ntionalbountyof2s.8d.thebarreluponexportationcarriesthegreaterpart,\nmore than two-thirds, of the produce of the buss fishery abroad. Between\nthirty and forty years ago, before the establishment of the buss bounty,\nfifteen shillings the barrel, I have been assured, was the common price of\nwhiteherrings.

Fortheselastfiveyears,ithas,atanaverage,beenat\ntwenty-five shillings the barrel. This high price, however, may have been\nowing to the real scarcity of the herrings upon the coast of Scotland. I\nmust observe, too, that the cask or barrel, which is usually sold with the\nherrings,andofwhichthepriceisincludedinalltheforegoingprices,has,\nsince the commencement of the American war, risen to about double its\nformer price, or from about three shillings to about six shillings. I must\nlikewise observe that the accounts I have received of the prices of former\ntimes have been by no means quite uniform and consistent; and an old\nmanofgreataccuracyandexperiencehasassuredmethat,morethanfifty\nyears ago, a guinea was the usual price of a barrel of good merchantable G.ed.p522\nherrings;andthis,Iimagine,maystillbelookeduponastheaverageprice.\nAll accounts, however, I think, agree that the price has not been lowered\ninthehomemarketinconsequenceofthebussbounty.\n1116 [35] When the undertakers of fisheries, after such liberal bounties have\nbeenbestoweduponthem,continuetoselltheircommodityatthesame,or\nevenatahigherpricethantheywereaccustomedtodobefore,itmightbe\nexpected that their profits should be very great; and it is not improbable\nthat those of some individuals may have been so.

The interest of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of the\n1124\npeople, how opposite soever they may at first sight appear, are, even in\nyears of the greatest scarcity, exactly the same. It is his interest to raise\nthe price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of the season requires,\nand it can never be his interest to raise it higher. By raising the price he\ndiscouragestheconsumption,andputseverybodymoreorless,butpartic-\nularly the inferior ranks of people, upon thrift and good management. If,\nby raising it too high, he discourages the consumption so much that the\nsupply of the season is likely to go beyond the consumption of the season,\nand to last for some time after the next crop begins to come in, he runs\nthe hazard, not only of losing a considerable part of his corn by natural\ncauses, but of being obliged to sell what remains of it for much less than\nwhathemighthavehadforitseveralmonthsbefore. Ifbynotraisingthe\npricehighenoughhediscouragestheconsumptionsolittlethatthesupply\nof the season is likely to fall short of the consumption of the season, he\nnot only loses a part of the profit which he might otherwise have made,\nbut he exposes the people to suffer before the end of the season, instead\nof the hardships of a dearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine. It is the\ninterest of the people that their daily, weekly, and monthly consumption G.ed.p525\nshould be proportioned as exactly as possible to the supply of the season.\nThe interest of the inland corn dealer is the same. By supplying them, as\nnearly as he can judge, in this proportion, he is likely to sell all his corn\nfor the highest price, and with the greatest profit; and his knowledge of\nthe state of the crop, and of his daily, weekly, and monthly sales, enable\nhim to judge, with more or less accuracy, how far they really are supplied\n404", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nin this manner. Without intending the interest of the people, he is neces-\nsarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat them, even in years of\nscarcity,prettymuchinthesamemannerastheprudentmasterofavessel\nis sometimes obliged to treat his crew.

The\ncornmerchanthimselfislikelytosufferthemostbythisexcessofavarice;\nnot only from the indignation which it generally excites against him, but,\nthough he should escape the effects of this indignation, from the quantity\nofcornwhichitnecessarilyleavesuponhishandsintheendoftheseason,\nandwhich,ifthenextseasonhappenstoprovefavourable,hemustalways\nsellforamuchlowerpricethanhemightotherwisehavehad.\n1125 [4] Wereitpossible,indeed,foronegreatcompanyofmerchantstopossess\nthemselvesofthewholecropofanextensivecountry,itmight,perhaps,be\ntheir interest to deal with it as the Dutch are said to do with the spicer-\nies of the Moluccas, to destroy or throw away a considerable part of it in\norder to keep up the price of the rest. But it is scarce possible, even by\nthe violence of law, to establish such an extensive monopoly with regard\nto corn; and, wherever the law leaves the trade free, it is of all commod-\nities the least liable to be engrossed or monopolized by the force of a few\nlarge capitals, which buy up the greater part of it. Not only its value far\nexceedswhat thecapitals ofa fewprivate menare capable ofpurchasing,\nbut,supposingtheywerecapableofpurchasingit,themannerinwhichit\nis produced renders this purchase practicable. As in every civilised coun-\ntry it is the commodity of which the annual consumption is the greatest,\nso a greater quantity of industry is annually employed in producing corn G.ed.p526\nthan in producing any other commodity. When it first comes from the\nground, too, it is necessarily divided among a greater number of owners\nthan any other commodity; and these owners can never be collected into\noneplacelikeanumberofindependentmanufacturers,butarenecessarily\nscatteredthroughallthedifferentcornersofthecountry.

Ifinayearofscarcity, therefore, any\nofthemshouldfindthathehadagooddealmorecornuponhandthan,at\nthecurrentprice,hecouldhopetodisposeofbeforetheendoftheseason,\nhe would never think of keeping up this price to his own loss, and to the\nsolebenefitofhisrivalsandcompetitors, butwouldimmediatelylowerit,\nin order to get rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in. The\nsame motives, the same interests, which would thus regulate the conduct\nofanyonedealer,wouldregulatethatofeveryother,andobligethemallin\ngeneral to sell their corn at the price which, according to the best of their\njudgment,wasmostsuitabletothescarcityorplentyoftheseason.\n1126 [5] Whoever examines with attention the history of the dearths and fam-\nines which have afflicted any part of Europe, during either the course of\nthe present or that of the two preceding centuries, of several of which we\nhave pretty exact accounts, will find, I believe, that a dearth never has\narisen from any combination among the inland dealers in corn, nor from\nany other cause but a real scarcity, occasioned sometimes perhaps, and\nin some particular places, by the waste of war, but in by far the greatest\nnumber of cases by the fault of the seasons; and that a famine has never\narisenfromanyothercausebuttheviolenceofgovernmentattempting,by\nimpropermeans,toremedytheinconveniencesofadearth.\n1127 [6] In an extensive corn country, between all the different parts of which\nthere is a free commerce and communication, the scarcity occasioned by\nthemostunfavourableseasonscanneverbesogreatastoproduceafam-\nine; and the scantiest crop, if managed with frugality and economy, will\nmaintainthroughtheyearthesamenumberofpeoplethatarecommonly\nfedonamoreaffluentmannerbyoneofmoderateplenty.

Instead of making profit upon such occasions, therefore,\nheisoftenindangerofbeingutterlyruined, andofhavinghismagazines\nplundered and destroyed by their violence. It is in years of scarcity, how-\never, when prices are high, that the corn merchant expects to make his\nprincipal profit. He is generally in contract with some farmers to fur-\nnish him for a certain number of years with a certain quantity of corn\nat a certain price. This contract price is settled according to what is sup-\nposed to be the moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or average\nprice, which before the late years of scarcity was commonly about eight-\nand-twenty shillings for the quarter of wheat, and for that of other grain\nin proportion. In years of scarcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a\ngreatpartofhiscornfortheordinaryprice,andsellsitforamuchhigher.\nThat this extraordinary profit, however, is no more than sufficient to put\nhistradeuponafairlevelwithothertrades,andtocompensatethemany\nlosses which he sustains upon other occasions, both from the perishable\nnatureofthecommodityitself,andfromthefrequentandunforeseenfluc- G.ed.p528\ntuationsofitsprice,seemsevidentenough,fromthissinglecircumstance,\nthat great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in any other trade.

The law which\nobliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant endeavoured\n409", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto hinder it from going on so fast. Both laws were evident violations of\nnaturalliberty,andthereforeunjust;andtheywereboth,too,asimpolitic\nas they were unjust. It is the interest of every society that things of this\nkind should never either be forced or obstructed.

Jackofalltradeswillneverbe\nrich, says the proverb. But the law ought always to trust people with the G.ed.p531\ncare of their own interest, as in their local situations they must generally\nbe able to judge better of it than the legislator can do. The law, however,\nwhich obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant was by\nfarthemostperniciousofthetwo.\n1138 [17] It obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which\nissoadvantageoustoeverysociety,butitobstructedlikewisetheimprove-\nment and cultivation of the land. By obliging the farmer to carry on two\ntrades instead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into two parts, of\nwhich one only could be employed in cultivation.

They would be enabled to keep their whole cap-\nitals, and even more than their whole capitals, constantly employed in\ncultivation.

Atlast,bythe15thofCharlesII.c.7.theengrossing\nor buying of corn in order to sell it again, as long as the price of wheat\ndid not exceed forty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grain\nin proportion, was declared lawful to all persons not being forestallers,\nthatis,notsellingagaininthesamemarketwithinthreemonths. Allthe\nfreedomwhichthetradeoftheinlandcorndealerhaseveryetenjoyedwas\nbestoweduponitbythisstatute. Thestatuteofthetwelfthofthepresent G.ed.p533\nking, which repeals almost all the other ancient laws against engrossers\nandforestallers,doesnotrepealtherestrictionsofthisparticularstatute,\nwhichthereforestillcontinueinforce.\n[23] This statute, however, authorizes in some measure two very absurd\n1144\npopularprejudices.\n1145 [24] First, it supposes that when the price of wheat has risen so high as\nforty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grains in proportion,\ncorn is likely to be so engrossed as to hurt the people. But from what has\nbeen already said, it seems evident enough that corn can at no price be\nso engrossed by the inland dealers as to hurt the people: and forty-eight\nshillings the quarter, besides, though it may be considered as a very high\nprice, yet in years of scarcity it is a price which frequently takes place\n411", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nimmediately after harvest, when scarce any part of the new crop can be\nsold off, and when it is impossible even for ignorance to suppose that any\npartofitcanbesoengrossedastohurtthepeople.\n1146 [25] Secondly,itsupposesthatthereisacertainpriceatwhichcornislikely\nto be forestalled, that is, bought up in order to be sold again soon after in\nthe same market, so as to hurt the people. But if a merchant ever buys\nup corn, either going to a particular market or in a particular market, in\nordertosellitagainsoonafterinthesamemarket,itmustbebecausehe\njudges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied through the whole\nseasonasuponthatparticularoccasion,andthattheprice,therefore,must\nsoon rise. If he judges wrong in this, and if the price does not rise, he not\nonly loses the whole profit of the stock which he employs in this manner,\nbut a part of the stock itself, by the expense and loss which necessarily\nattendthestoringandkeepingofcorn. Hehurtshimself,therefore,much\nmore essentially than he can hurt even the particular people whom he\nmay hinder from supplying themselves upon that particular market day,\nbecause they may afterwards supply themselves just as cheap upon any\nother market day. If he judges right, instead of hurting the great body of\nthe people, he renders them a most important service. By making them\nfeeltheinconvenienciesofadearthsomewhatearlierthantheyotherwise\nmight do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they\ncertainly would do, if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume\nfasterthansuitedtherealscarcityoftheseason. Whenthescarcityisreal,\nthe best thing that can be done for the people is to divide the inconveni- G.ed.p534\nencies of it as equally as possible through all the different months, and\nweeks,anddaysoftheyear. Theinterestofthecornmerchantmakeshim\nstudy to do this as exactly as he can: and as no other person can have\neither the same interest, or the same knowledge, or the same abilities to\ndoitsoexactlyashe,thismostimportantoperationofcommerceoughtto\nbetrustedentirelytohim;or,inotherwords,thecorntrade,sofaratleast\nasconcernsthesupplyofthehomemarket,oughttobeleftperfectlyfree.\n1147 [26] Thepopularfearofengrossingandforestallingmaybecomparedtothe\npopular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft. The unfortunate wretches\naccused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes\nimputedtothemthanthosewhohavebeenaccusedoftheformer. Thelaw\nwhich put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft, which put it out\nof any man\u2019s power to gratify his own malice by accusing his neighbour\nof that imaginary crime, seems effectually to have put an end to those\nfears and suspicions by taking away the great cause which encouraged\nand supported them. The law which should restore entire freedom to the\ninlandtradeofcornwouldprobablyproveaseffectualtoputanendtothe\npopularfearsofengrossingandforestalling.\n1148 [27] The 15th of Charles II. c.7. however, with all its imperfections, has\nperhapscontributedmorebothtotheplentifulsupplyofthehomemarket,\nand to the increase of tillage, than any other law in the statute book. It\n412", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the liberty and\nprotection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both the supply of the home\nmarket,andtheinterestoftillage,aremuchmoreeffectuallypromotedby\ntheinlandthaneitherbytheimportationorexportationtrade.\n1149 [28] The proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported\ninto Great Britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed, it has been com-\nputedbytheauthorofthetractsuponthecorntrade,doesnotexceedthat\nofonetofivehundredandseventy.

Imentionthemonlyinorder\ntoshowofhowmuchlessconsequence,intheopinionofthemostjudicious\nandexperiencedpersons,theforeigntradeofcornisthanthehometrade.\nThe great cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding the es-\ntablishment of the bounty may perhaps, with reason, be ascribed in some\nmeasure to the operation of this statute of Charles II., which had been\nenacted about five-and-twenty years before, and which had therefore full\ntimetoproduceitseffect.\n1152 [31] AveryfewwordswillsufficientlyexplainallthatIhavetosayconcern-\ningtheotherthreebranchesofthecorntrade.\n1153 [32] II. The trade of the merchant importer of foreign corn for home con-\nsumptionevidentlycontributestotheimmediatesupplyofthehomemar-\nket, and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the\npeople. It tends, indeed, to lower somewhat the average money price of\ncorn, but not to diminish its real value, or the quantity of labour which it\niscapableofmaintaining. Ifimportationwasatalltimesfree,ourfarmers\nand country gentlemen would, probably, one year with another, get less\nmoneyfortheircornthantheydoatpresent,whenimportationisatmost\ntimesineffectprohibited;butthemoneywhichtheygotwouldbeofmore\nvalue, would buy more goods of all other kinds, and would employ more\nlabour. Theirrealwealth,theirrealrevenue,therefore,wouldbethesame\nas at present, though it might be expressed by a smaller quantity of sil-\nver; and they would neither be disabled nor discouraged from cultivating\ncorn as much as they do at present. On the contrary, as the rise in the\nreal value of silver, in consequence of lowering the money price of corn,\nlowers somewhat the money price of all other commodities, it gives the\nindustry of the country, where it takes place, some advantage in all for-\neign markets, and thereby tends to encourage and increase that industry.\nBut the extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion to the\n413", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngeneral industry of the country where it grows, or to the number of those\nwho produce something else, and therefore have something else, or what\ncomes to the same thing, the price of something else, to give in exchange\nfor corn. But in every country the home market, as it is the nearest and G.ed.p536\nmostconvenient,soisitlikewisethegreatestandmostimportantmarket\nforcorn.

Yet, till wheat had risen above this latter\nprice, it was by this statute subjected to a very high duty; and, tin it had\nrisen above the former, to a duty which amounted to a prohibition. The\nimportation of other sorts of grain was restrained at rates, and by duties,\nin proportion to the value of the grain, almost equally high2. Subsequent\nlawsstillfurtherincreasedthoseduties.\n1155 [34] The distress which, in years of scarcity, the strict execution of those\nlawsmighthavebroughtuponthepeople,wouldprobablyhavebeenvery\ngreat. But, upon such occasions, its execution was generally suspended\nby temporary statutes, which permitted, for a limited time, the importa-\ntionofforeigncorn.

If, when wheat was either below forty-\neight shillings the quarter, or not much above it, foreign corn could have\nbeenimportedeitherdutyfree,oruponpayingonlyasmallduty,itmight\nhavebeenexportedagain, withthebenefitofthebounty, tothegreatloss\nof the public revenue, and to the entire perversion of the institution, of\nwhich the object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that\nforthegrowthofforeigncountries.\n1157 [36] III. The trade of the merchant exporter of corn for foreign consump-\ntion certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the\nhome market. It does so, however, indirectly. From whatever source this\nsupplymaybeusuallydrawn, whetherfromhomegrowthorfromforeign\nimportation, unless more corn is either usually grown, or usually impor-\ntedintothecountry,thanwhatisusuallyconsumedinit,thesupplyofthe\nhome market can never be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can in\nall ordinary cases be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow\nmore, and the importers never to import more, than what the bare con-\nsumption of the home market requires. That market will very seldom be\noverstocked; butitwillgenerallybeunderstocked, thepeoplewhosebusi-\nnessitistosupplyitbeinggenerallyafraidlesttheirgoodsshouldbeleft\nupon their hands. The prohibition of exportation limits the improvement\nand cultivation of the country to what the supply of its own inhabitants\nrequires. The freedom of exportation enables it to extend cultivation for\nthesupplyofforeignnations.\n1158 [37] By the 12th of Charles II. c.4. the exportation of corn was permitted\nwheneverthepriceofwheatdidnotexceedfortyshillingsthequarter,and\nthat of other grain in proportion. By the 15th of the same prince, this\nliberty was extended till the price of wheat exceeded forty-eight shillings\nthe quarter; and by the 22nd, to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed,\nwasto bepaidtothe kinguponsuchexportation. But all grainwasrated\nsolow inthebook ofratesthat thispoundageamounted onlyuponwheat\nto a shilling, upon oats to fourpence, and upon all other grain to sixpence\nthequarter. Bythe1stofWilliamandMary,theactwhichestablishedthe\nbounty,thissmalldutywasvirtuallytakenoffwheneverthepriceofwheat G.ed.p538\ndid not exceed, forty-eight shillings the quarter; and by the 11th and l2th\nofWilliamIII.c.20.itwasexpresslytakenoffatallhigherprices.\n1159 [38] The trade of the merchant exporter was, in this manner, not only en-\ncouragedbyabounty,butrenderedmuchmorefreethanthatoftheinland\ndealer. By the last of these statutes, corn could be engrossed at any price\nfor exportation, but it could not be engrossed for inland sale except when\nthe price did not exceed forty-eight shillings the quarter. The interest of\ntheinlanddealer,however,ithasalreadybeenshown,canneverbeoppos-\nite to that of the great body of the people. That of the merchant exporter\nmay, and in fact sometimes is. If, while his own country labours under a\ndearth,aneighbouringcountryshouldbeafflictedwithafamine,itmight\n415", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbe his interest to carry corn to the latter country in such quantities as\nmight very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth. The plentiful\nsupplyofthehomemarketwasnotthedirectobjectofthosestatutes;but,\nunderthepretenceofencouragingagriculture,toraisethemoneypriceof\ncorn as high as possible, and thereby to occasion, as much as possible, a\nconstant dearth in the home market. By the discouragement of importa-\ntion, the supply of that market, even in times of great scarcity, was con-\nfinedtothehomegrowth;andbytheencouragementofexportation,when\nthepricewassohighasforty-eightshillingsthequarter,thatmarketwas\nnot, even in times of considerable scarcity, allowed to enjoy the whole of\nthat growth. The temporary laws, prohibiting for a limited time the ex-\nportation of corn, and taking off for a limited time the duties upon its\nimportation, expedients to which Great Britain has been obliged so fre-\nquently to have recourse, sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of her\ngeneral system. Had that system been good, she would not so frequently\nhavebeenreducedtothenecessityofdepartingfromit.\n1160 [39] Wereallnationstofollowtheliberalsystemoffreeexportationandfree\nimportation, the different states into which a great continent was divided\nwouldsofarresemblethedifferentprovincesofagreatempire. Asamong\nthe different provinces of a great empire the freedom of the inland trade\nappears, both from reason and experience, not only the best palliative of\na dearth, but the most effectual preventative of a famine; so would the\nfreedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the different\nstatesintowhichagreatcontinentwasdivided. Thelargerthecontinent,\ntheeasierthecommunicationthroughallthedifferentpartsofit,bothby G.ed.p539\nland and by water, the less would any one particular part of it ever be ex-\nposed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any one country being\nmore likely to be relieved by the plenty of some other. But very few coun-\ntries have entirely adopted this liberal system. The freedom of the corn\ntrade is almost everywhere more or less restrained, and, in many coun-\ntries, is confined by such absurd regulations as frequently aggravate the\nunavoidablemisfortuneofadearthintothedreadfulcalamityofafamine.\nThedemandofsuchcountriesforcornmayfrequentlybecomesogreatand\nsourgentthatasmallstateintheirneighbourhood,whichhappenedatthe\nsametimetobelabouringundersomedegreeofdearth,couldnotventure\nto supply them without exposing itself to the like dreadful calamity. The\nverybadpolicyofonecountrymaythusrenderitinsomemeasuredanger-\nousandimprudenttoestablishwhatwouldotherwisebethebestpolicyin\nanother. The unlimited freedom of exportation, however, would be much\nless dangerous in great states, in which the growth being much greater,\nthesupplycouldseldombemuchaffectedbyanyquantityofcornthatwas\nlikely to be exported. In a Swiss canton, or in some of the little states of\nItaly, it may perhaps sometimes be necessary to restrain the exportation\nof corn. In such great countries as France or England it scarce ever can.\nTo hinder, besides, the farmer from sending his goods at all times to the\n416", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbestmarketisevidentlytosacrificetheordinarylawsofjusticetoanidea\nofpublicutility,toasortofreasonsofstate;anactoflegislativeauthority\nwhich ought to be exercised only, which can be pardoned only in cases of\nthe most urgent necessity. The price at which the exportation of corn is\nprohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited, ought always to be a very high\nprice.\n1161 [40] The laws concerning corn may everywhere be compared to the laws\nconcerningreligion.

It is upon this account, perhaps, that we so seldom find a reasonable\nsystemestablishedwithregardtoeitherofthosetwocapitalobjects.\n1162 [41] IV. The trade of the merchant carrier, or of the importer of foreign\ncorn in order to export it again, contributes to the plentiful supply of the\nhome market. It is not indeed the direct purpose of his trade to sell his\ncorn there. But he will generally be willing to do so, and even for a good\ndeal less money than he might expect in a foreign market; because he\nsavesinthismannertheexpenseofloadingandunloading, offreightand\ninsurance. Theinhabitantsofthecountrywhich,bymeansofthecarrying\ntrade, becomesthemagazineandstorehouseforthesupplyofothercoun- G.ed.p540\ntries can very seldom be in want themselves. Though the carrying trade\nmight thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in the\nhomemarket,itwouldnottherebyloweritsrealvalue. Itwouldonlyraise\nsomewhattherealvalueofsilver.\n1163 [42] The carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain, upon all\nordinaryoccasions,bythehighdutiesupontheimportationofforeigncorn,\nofthegreaterpartofwhichtherewasnodrawback; anduponextraordin-\nary occasions, when a scarcity made it necessary to suspend those duties\nby temporary statutes, exportation was always prohibited.

TheimprovementandprosperityofGreatBritain,which\nhasbeensooftenascribedtothoselaws,mayveryeasilybeaccountedfor\nby other causes.

Thosemerchantsandmanufacturersenjoyasort\nof monopoly in the country which is so indulgent to them. That country\nbecomes a market both more extensive and more advantageous for their\ngoods: more extensive, because the goods of other nations being either\nexcluded or subjected to heavier duties, it takes off a greater quantity of\ntheirs: more advantageous, because the merchants of the favoured coun-\ntry,enjoyingasortofmonopolythere,willoftenselltheirgoodsforabetter\npricethanifexposedtothefreecompetitionofallothernations.\n1176 [2] Such treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the mer-\nchants and manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantage-\noustothoseofthefavouringcountry.

That part of its own produce with which such a nation\npurchasesforeigngoodsmustconsequentlybesoldcheaper,becausewhen\ntwo things are exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a\nnecessary consequence, or rather the same thing with the dearness of the\nother. Theexchangeablevalueofitsannualproduce,therefore,islikelyto\nbe diminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however, can scarce\namount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the gain which it\nmight otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper than it other-\nwise might do, it will not probably sell them for less than they cost; nor,\nas in the case of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital\nemployedinbringingthemtomarket,togetherwiththeordinaryprofitsof\nstock.

It is upon this principle\nthat the treaty of commerce between England and Portugal, concluded in G.ed.p546\n1703 by Mr. Methuen, has been so much commended. The following is a\nliteraltranslationofthattreaty,whichconsistsofthreearticlesonly.\nART. I\n1178 [4] His sacred royal majesty of Portugal promises, both in his own name,\nand that of his successors, to admit, for ever hereafter, into Portugal, the\nwoollencloths,andtherestofthewoollenmanufacturesoftheBritish,as\nwas accustomed, till they were prohibited by the law; nevertheless upon\nthiscondition:\nART. II\n1179 [5] That is to say, that her sacred royal majesty of Great Britain shall, in\nherownname,andthatofhersuccessors,beobliged,foreverhereafter,to\nadmitthewinesofthegrowthofPortugalintoBritain;sothatatnotime,\nwhetherthereshallbepeaceorwarbetweenthekingdomsofBritainand\nFrance, anything more shall be demanded for these wines by the name of\ncustomorduty,orbywhatsoeverothertitle,directlyorindirectly,whether\nthey shall be imported into Great Britain in or hogsheads, or other casks,\nthan what shall be demanded for the like quantity or measure of French\nwine, deducting or abating a third part of the custom or duty. But if at\nany time this deduction or abatement of customs, which is to be made as\naforesaid, shall in any manner be attempted and prejudiced, it shall be\njust and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of Portugal, again to prohibit\nthewoollencloths,andtherestoftheBritishwoollenmanufactures.\nART. III\n1180 [6] The most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promise and take upon\nthemselves, that their above named masters shall ratify this treaty; and\nwithinthespaceoftwomonthstheratificationsshallbeexchanged.\n1181 [7] By this treaty the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the Eng-\nlish woollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition; that is, not\nto raise the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does not\nbecomeboundtoadmitthemuponanybettertermsthanthoseofanyother G.ed.p547\nnation, of France or Holland for example. The crown of Great Britain, on\nthe contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal upon paying\nonly two-thirds of the duty which is paid for those of France, the wines\nmost likely to come into competition with them. So far this treaty, there-\nfore,isevidentlyadvantageoustoPortugal,anddisadvantageoustoGreat\nBritain.\n1182 [8] It has been celebrated, however, as a masterpiece of the commercial\npolicy of England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater\n421", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nquantity of gold thancan be employed in its domestic commerce, whether\nintheshapeofcoinorofplate. Thesurplusistoovaluabletobeallowedto\nlieidleandlockedupincoffers,andasitcanfindnoadvantageousmarket\nathome,itmust,notwithstandinganyprohibition,besentabroad,andex-\nchanged for something for which there is a more advantageous market at\nhome. A large share of it comes annually to England, in return either for\nEnglishgoods,orforthoseofotherEuropeannationsthatreceivetheirre-\nturnsthroughEngland. Mr.Barettiwasinformedthattheweeklypacket-\nboatfromLisbonbrings,oneweekwithanother,morethanfiftythousand\npounds in gold to England. The sum had probably been exaggerated. It\nwould amount to more than two millions six hundred thousand pounds a\nyear,whichismorethantheBrazilsaresupposedtoafford.\n1183 [9] Our merchants were some years ago out of humour with the crown of\nPortugal. Someprivilegeswhichhadbeengrantedthem,notbytreaty,but\nbythefreegraceofthatcrown,atthesolicitationindeed,itisprobable,and\ninreturnformuchgreaterfavours,defenceandprotection,fromthecrown\nof Great Britain had been either infringed or revoked. The people, there-\nfore, usually most interested in celebrating the Portugal trade were then\nratherdisposedtorepresentitaslessadvantageousthanithadcommonly\nbeen imagined. The far greater part, almost the whole, they pretended,\nof this annual importation of gold, was not on account of Great Britain,\nbut of other European nations; the fruits and wines of Portugal annually\nimported into Great Britain nearly compensating the value of the British\ngoodssentthither.\n1184 [10] Let us suppose, however, that the whole was on account of Great\nBritain,andthatitamountedtoastillgreatersumthanMr.Barettiseems G.ed.p548\ntoimagine;thistradewouldnot,uponthataccount,bemoreadvantageous\nthananyotherinwhich,forthesamevaluesentout,wereceivedanequal\nvalueofconsumablegoodsinreturn.\n1185 [11] Itisbutaverysmallpartofthisimportationwhich,itcanbesupposed,\nis employed as an annual addition either to the plate or to the coin of the\nkingdom.

Butifthoseconsumablegoodswerepurchased\ndirectly with the produce of English industry, it would be more for the\nadvantage of England than first to purchase with that produce the gold\nof Portugal, and afterwards to purchase with that gold those consumable\ngoods. Adirectforeigntradeofconsumptionisalwaysmoreadvantageous\nthan a round-about one; and to bring the same value of foreign goods to\nthe home market, requires a much smaller capital in the one way than in\nthe other. If a smaller share of its industry, therefore, had been employed\ninproducinggoodsfitforthePortugalmarket,andagreaterinproducing\nthose fit for the other markets, where those consumable goods for which\nthereisademandinGreatBritainaretobehad,itwouldhavebeenmore\nfortheadvantageofEngland.

InbuyinggoldofPortugal,indeed,we\nbuy it at the first hand; whereas, in buying it of any other nation, except\nSpain, we should buy it at the second, and might pay somewhat dearer.\nThis difference, however, would surely be too insignificant to deserve the\npublicattention.\n1187 [13] Almostallourgold,itissaid,comesfromPortugal.

If nine-tenths of this quantity are imported from one country,\nthere remains a tenth only to be imported from all others.

HadthekingofPortugalsubmittedtothoseignominioustermswhich\nhis brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed to him, Britain would have\nbeen freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the Por-\ntugal trade, the burden of supporting a very weak ally, so unprovided of\neverything for his own defence that the whole power of England, had it\nbeen directed to that single purpose, could scarce perhaps have defended\nhimforanothercampaign. ThelossofthePortugaltradewould,nodoubt,\nhave occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at that\ntime engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a year\nor two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their capit-\n423", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nals;andinthiswouldprobablyhaveconsistedalltheinconveniencywhich\nEnglandcouldhavesufferedfromthisnotablepieceofcommercialpolicy.\n1189 [15] The great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the pur-\nposeofplatenorofcoin,butofforeigntrade. Around-aboutforeigntrade\nof consumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these\nmetals than of almost any other goods. As they are the universal instru-\nments of commerce, they are more readily received in return for all com-\nmodities than any other goods; and on account of their small bulk and\ngreat value, it costs less to transport them backward and forward from\none place to another than almost any other sort of merchandise, and they\nlose less of their value by being so transported. Of all the commodities,\ntherefore, which are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpose\nbut to be sold or exchanged again for some other goods in another, there\nare none so convenient as gold and silver. In facilitating all the different\nround-about foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in Great\nBritainconsiststheprincipaladvantageofthePortugaltrade;andthough\nitisnotacapitaladvantage,itisnodoubtaconsiderableone.\n1190 [16] That any annual addition which, it can reasonably be supposed, is G.ed.p550\nmade either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom, could require but\naverysmallannualimportationofgoldandsilver,seemsevidentenough;\nandthoughwehadnodirecttradewithPortugal,thissmallquantitycould\nalways,somewhereoranother,beveryeasilygot.\n1191 [17] Thoughthegoldsmith\u2019stradebeveryconsiderableinGreatBritain,the\nfar. greater part of the new plate which they annually sell is made from\nother old plate melted down; so that the addition annually made to the\nwhole plate of the kingdom cannot be very great, and could require but a\nverysmallannualimportation.\n1192 [18] Itisthesamecasewiththecoin. Nobodyimagines,Ibelieve,thateven\nthe greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together,\nbefore the late reformation of the gold coin, to upwards of eight hundred\nthousandpoundsayearingold, wasanannualadditiontothemoneybe-\nforecurrentinthekingdom. Inacountrywheretheexpenseofthecoinage\nisdefrayedbythegovernment,thevalueofthecoin,evenwhenitcontains\nitsfullstandardweightofgoldandsilver,canneverbemuchgreaterthan\nthatofanequalquantityofthosemetalsuncoined;becauseitrequiresonly\nthe trouble of going to the mint, and the delay perhaps of a few weeks, to\nprocure for any quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of\nthose metals in coin. But, in every country, the greater part of the cur-\nrent coin is almost always more or less worn, or otherwise degenerated\nfrom its standard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a\ngood deal so, the gold being more than two per cent and the silver more\nthan eight per cent below its standard weight. But if forty-four guineas\nand a half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of gold,\ncould purchase very little more than a pound weight could of uncoined\ngold,forty-fourguineasandahalfwantingapartoftheirweightcouldnot\n424", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\npurchaseapoundweight,andsomethingwastobeaddedinordertomake\nupthedeficiency. Thecurrentpriceofgoldbullionatmarket,therefore,in-\nsteadofbeingthesamewiththemintprice,or46l.14s.6d.,wasthenabout\n47l.14s.andsometimesaboutforty-eightpounds. Whenthegreaterpartof\nthecoin,however,wasinthisdegeneratecondition,forty-fourguineasand\na half, fresh from the mint, would purchase no more goods in the market\nthananyotherordinaryguineas,becausewhentheycameintothecoffers\nof the merchant, being confounded with other money, they could not af- G.ed.p551\nterwards be distinguished without more trouble than the difference was\nworth. Like other guineas they were worth no more than 46l.14s.6d. If\nthrown into the melting pot, however, they produced, without any sens-\nibleloss,apoundweightofstandardgold,whichcouldbesoldatanytime\nfor between 47l.14s. and 48l. either of gold or silver, as fit for all the pur-\nposes of coin as that which had been melted down. There was an evident\nprofit, therefore, in melting down new coined money, and it was done so\ninstantaneously, that no precaution of government could prevent it. The\noperations of the mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of\nPenelope;theworkthatwasdoneinthedaywasundoneinthenight. The\nmintwasemployed, notsomuchinmakingdailyadditionstothecoin, as\ninreplacingtheverybestpartofitwhichwasdailymelteddown.\n1193 [19] Weretheprivatepeople,whocarrytheirgoldandsilvertothemint,to\npay themselves for the coinage, it would add to the value of those metals\nin the same manner as the fashion does to that of plate. Coined gold and\nsilverwouldbemorevaluablethanuncoined. Theseignorage,ifitwasnot\nexorbitant, would add to thebullion the whole value of the duty; because,\nthe government having everywhere the exclusive privilege of coining, no\ncoin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it. If\nthe duty was exorbitant indeed, that is, if it was very much above the\nreal value of the labour and expense requisite for coinage, false coiners,\nboth at home and abroad, might be encouraged, by the great difference\nbetweenthevalueofbullionandthatofcoin,topourinsogreataquantity\nof counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government money.\nIn France, however, though the seignorage is eight per cent, no sensible\ninconveniency of this kind is found to arise from it. The dangers to which\na false coiner is everywhere exposed, if he lives in the country of which\nhe counterfeits the coin, and to which his agents or correspondents are\nexposed if he lives in a foreign country, are by far too great to be incurred\nforthesakeofaprofitofsixorsevenpercent.\n1194 [20] The seignorage in France raises the value of the coin higher than in\nproportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus by the\nedict of January 1726, the1 mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats G.ed.p552\nwasfixedatsevenhundredandfortylivresninesousandonedenierone-\neleventh,themarkofeightParisounces. ThegoldcoinofFrance,making\n1[Smith]SeeDictionairedesMonnoies,tom.ii.articleSeigneurage,p.489.parM.Abot\ndeBazinghen,Conseiller-ComissaireenlaCourdesMonnoies\u00e0Paris.\n425", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nan allowance for the remedy of the mint, contains twenty-one carats and\nthree-fourths of fine gold, and two carats one fourth of alloy. The mark\nof standard gold, therefore, is worth no more than about six hundred and\nseventy-one livres ten deniers. But in France this mark of standard gold\nis coined into thirty Louis-d\u2019ors of twenty-four livres each, or into seven\nhundred and twenty livres. The coinage, therefore, increases the value of\na mark of standard gold bullion, by the difference between six hundred\nand seventy-one livres ten deniers, and seven hundred and twenty livres;\norbyforty-eightlivresnineteensousandtwodeniers.\n1195 [21] A seignorage will, in many cases, take away altogether, and will, in\nall cases, diminish the profit of melting down the new coin. This profit\nalways arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion which\nthe common currency ought to contain, and that which it actually does\ncontain. If this difference is less than the seignorage, there will be loss\ninstead of profit. If it is equal to the seignorage, there will neither be\nprofit nor loss. If it is greater than the seignorage, there will indeed be\nsome profit, but less than if there was no seignorage. If, before the late\nreformation of the gold coin, for example, there had been a seignorage of\nfive per cent upon the coinage, there would have been a loss of three per\ncentuponthemeltingdownofthegoldcoin. Iftheseignoragehadbeentwo\nper cent there would have been neither profit nor loss. If the seignorage\nhad been one per cent there would have been a profit, but of one per cent\nonlyinsteadoftwopercent. Wherevermoneyisreceivedbytale,therefore,\nand not by weight, a seignorage is the most effectual preventative of the\nmelting down of the coin, and, for the same reason, of its exportation. It\nis the best and heaviest pieces that are commonly either melted down or\nexported;becauseitisuponsuchthatthelargestprofitsaremade.\n1196 [22] The law for encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free,\nwas first enacted during the reign of Charles II. for a limited time; and\nafterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was\nrendered perpetual. The Bank of England, in order to replenish their cof-\nfers with money, are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint; and\nit was more for their interest, they probably imagined, that the coinage\nshould be at the expense of the government than at their own. It was\nprobably out of complaisance to this great company that the government\nagreed to render this law perpetual. Should the custom of weighing gold, G.ed.p553\nhowever, come to be disused, as it is very likely to be on account of its in-\nconveniency; should the gold coin of England come to be received by tale,\nas it was before the late recoinage, this great company may, perhaps, find\nthat they have upon this, as upon some other occasions, mistaken their\nowninterestnotalittle.\n1197 [23] Beforethelatere-coinage,whenthegoldcurrencyofEnglandwastwo\npercentbelowitsstandardweight,astherewasnoseignorage,itwastwo\nper cent below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which\nit ought to have contained. When this great company, therefore, bought\n426", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngold bullion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it two\nper cent more than it was worth after coinage. But if there had been a\nseignorage of two per cent upon the coinage, the common gold currency,\nthough two per cent below its standard weight, would notwithstanding\nhave been equal in value to the quantity of standard gold which it ought\nto have contained; the value of the fashion compensating in this case the\ndiminution of the weight. They would indeed have had the seignorage to\npay,whichbeingtwopercent,theirlossuponthewholetransactionwould\nhave been two per cent exactly the same, but no greater than it actually\nwas.\n1198 [24] If the seignorage had been five per cent, and the gold currency only\ntwo per cent below its standard weight, the bank would in this case have\ngainedthreepercentuponthepriceofthebullion;butastheywouldhave\nhad a seignorage of five per cent to pay upon the coinage, their loss upon\nthe whole transaction would, in the same manner, have been exactly two\npercent.\n1199 [25] Iftheseignoragehadbeenonlyonepercentandthegoldcurrencytwo\nper cent below its standard weight, the bank would in this case have lost\nonlyonepercentuponthepriceofthebullion;butastheywouldlikewise\nhave had a seignorage of one per cent to pay, their loss upon the whole\ntransaction would have been exactly two per cent in the same manner as\ninallothercases.\n1200 [26] If there was a reasonable seignorage, while at the same time the coin\ncontaineditsfullstandardweight,asithasdoneverynearlysincethelast\nrecoinage, whatever the bank might lose by the seignorage, they would\ngainuponthepriceofthebullion;andwhatevertheymightgainuponthe\npriceofthebullion,theywouldlosebytheseignorage. Theywouldneither\nlose nor gain, therefore, upon the whole transaction, and they would in\nthis, as in all the foregoing cases, be exactly in the same situation as if\ntherewasnoseignorage.\n1201 [27] When the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage\nsmuggling, the merchant who deals in it, though he advances, does not\nproperly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity. G.ed.p554\nThe tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer. But money is a\ncommoditywithregardtowhicheverymanisamerchant.

Whenthetaxuponcoinage,therefore,isso\nmoderateasnottoencouragefalsecoining,thougheverybodyadvancesthe\ntax,nobodyfinallypaysit;becauseeverybodygetsitbackintheadvanced\nvalueofthecoin.\n1202 [28] A moderate seignorage, therefore, would not in any case augment the\nexpenseofthebank,orofanyotherprivatepersonswhocarrytheirbullion\nto the mint in order to be coined, and the want of a moderate seignorage\ndoes not in any case diminish it. Whether there is or is not a seignorage,\nifthecurrencycontainsitsfullstandardweight,thecoinagecostsnothing\n427", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto anybody, and if it is short of that weight, the coinage must always cost\nthedifferencebetweenthequantityofbullionwhichoughttobecontained\ninit,andthatwhichactuallyiscontainedinit.\n1203 [29] Thegovernment,therefore,whenitdefraystheexpenseofcoinage,not\nonly incurs some small expense, but loses some small revenue which it\nmight get by a proper duty; and neither the bank nor any other private\npersonsareinthesmallestdegreebenefitedbythisuselesspieceofpublic\ngenerosity.\n1204 [30] The directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to\nagree to the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a specula-\ntion which promises them no gain, but only pretends to insure them from\nanyloss. Inthepresentstateofthegoldcoin,andaslongasitcontinuesto\nbereceivedbyweight,theycertainlywouldgainnothingbysuchachange.\nButifthecustomofweighingthegoldcoinshouldevergointomisuse, as\nit is very likely to do, and if the gold coin should ever fall into the same\nstateofdegradationinwhichitwasbeforethelatere-coinage,thegain,or\nmoreproperlythesavingsofthebank,inconsequenceoftheimpositionof\na seignorage, would probably be very considerable. The Bank of England\nis the only company which sends any considerable quantity of bullion to\nthe mint, and the burden of the annual coinage falls entirely, or almost\nentirely,uponit. Ifthisannualcoinagehadnothingtodobuttorepairthe\nunavoidablelossesandnecessarywearandtearofthecoin,itcouldseldom\nexceed fifty thousand or at most a hundred thousand pounds. But when\nthe coin is degraded below its standard weight, the annual coinage must,\nbesides this, fill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting\npot are continually making in the current coin.

The mother city, though she considered\nthe colony as a child, at all times entitled to great favour and assistance,\nand owing in return much gratitude and respect, yet considered it as an\nemancipated child over whom she pretended to claim no direct authority\nor jurisdiction. The colony settled its own form of government, enacted\nitsownlaws, electeditsownmagistrates, andmadepeaceorwarwithits\nneighboursasanindependentstate,whichhadnooccasiontowaitforthe\napprobationorconsentofthemothercity. Nothingcanbemoreplainand\ndistinctthantheinterestwhichdirectedeverysuchestablishment.\n1209 [3] Rome, like most of the other ancient republics, was originally founded\nupon an Agrarian law which divided the public territory in a certain pro-\nportion among the different citizens who composed the state. The course", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof human affairs by marriage, by succession, and by alienation, necessar-\nily deranged this original division, and frequently threw the lands, which G.ed.p557\nhadbeenallottedforthemaintenanceofmanydifferentfamilies,intothe\npossessionofasingleperson. Toremedythisdisorder,forsuchitwassup-\nposed to be, a law was made restricting the quantity of land which any\ncitizencouldpossesstofivehundredjugera,aboutthreehundredandfifty\nEnglish acres. This law, however, though we read of its having been ex-\necutedupononeortwooccasions,waseitherneglectedorevaded,andthe\ninequality of fortunes went on continually increasing. The greater part of\nthecitizenshadnoland,andwithoutitthemannersandcustomsofthose\ntimes rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his independency. In\nthe present time, though a poor man has no land of his own, if he has a\nlittle stock he may either farm the lands of another, or he may carry on\nsome little retail trade; and if he has no stock, he may find employment\neither as a country labourer or as an artificer. But among the ancient\nRomans the lands of the rich were all cultivated by slaves, who wrought\nunder an overseer who was likewise a slave; so that a poor freeman had\nlittle chance of being employed either as a farmer or as a labourer. All\ntradesandmanufacturestoo,eventheretailtrade,werecarriedonbythe\nslaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth, author-\nity, and protection made it difficult for a poor freeman to maintain the\ncompetition against them. The citizens, therefore, who had no land, had\nscarce any other means of subsistence but the bounties of the candidates\nat the annual elections. The tribunes, when they had a mind to animate\nthepeopleagainsttherichandthegreat,puttheminmindoftheancient\ndivision of lands, and represented that law which restricted this sort of\nprivate property as the fundamental law of the republic. The people be-\ncame clamorous to get land, and the rich and the great, we may believe,\nwere perfectly determined not to give them any part of theirs. To satisfy\nthem in some measure therefore, they frequently proposed to send out a\nnewcolony. ButconqueringRomewas,evenuponsuchoccasions,underno\nnecessity of turning out her citizens to seek their fortune, if one may say\nso, through the wide world, without knowing where they were to settle.\nShe assigned them lands generally in the conquered provinces of Italy,\nwhere, being within the dominions of the republic, they could never form\nan independent state; but were at best but a sort of corporation, which,\nthoughithadthepowerofenactingbye-lawsforitsowngovernment,was\nat all times subject to the correction, jurisdiction, and legislative author- G.ed.p558\nity of the mother city. The sending out a colony of this kind not only gave\nsome satisfaction to the people, but often established a sort of garrison,\ntoo, in a newly conquered province, of which the obedience might other-\nwise have been doubtful. A Roman colony therefore, whether we consider\nthe nature of the establishment itself or the motives for making it, was\naltogetherdifferentfromaGreekone. Thewordsaccordingly,whichinthe\noriginallanguagesdenotethosedifferentestablishments,haveverydiffer-\n431", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nentmeanings. TheLatinword(Colonia)signifiessimplyaplantation. The\nGreek word \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1, on the contrary, signifies a separation of dwelling, a\ndeparture from home, a going out of the house. But, though the Roman\ncolonieswereinmanyrespectsdifferentfromtheGreekones,theinterest\nwhich prompted to establish them was equally plain and distinct. Both\ninstitutions derived their origin either from irresistible necessity, or from\nclearandevidentutility.\n1210 [4] The establishment of the European colonies in America and the West\nIndies arose from no necessity: and though the utility which has resulted\nfrom them has been very great, it is not altogether so clear and evident.\nItwasnotunderstoodattheirfirstestablishment,andwasnotthemotive\neither of that establishment or of the discoveries which gave occasion to\nit, and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility are not, perhaps, well\nunderstoodatthisday.\n[5] The Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried\n1211\nonaveryadvantageouscommerceinspiceries,andotherEastIndiagoods,\nwhich they distributed among the other nations of Europe. They pur-\nchased them chiefly in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the\nMamelukes,theenemiesoftheTurks,ofwhomtheVenetiansweretheen-\nemies; andthisunionofinterest, assistedbythemoneyofVenice, formed\nsuchaconnectionasgavetheVenetiansalmostamonopolyofthetrade.\n[6] The great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Por-\n1212\ntuguese. They had been endeavouring, during the course of the fifteenth\ncentury, to find out by sea a way to the countries from which the Moors\nbrought them ivory and gold dust across the desert. They discovered the\nMadeiras, the Canaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verde Islands, the coast\nof Guinea, that of Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela, and, finally, the\nCapeofGoodHope. Theyhadlongwishedtoshareintheprofitabletraffic\nof the Venetians, and this last discovery opened to them a probable pro- G.ed.p559\nspect of doing so. In 1497, Vasco de Gama sailed from the port of Lisbon\nwith a fleet of four ships, and after a navigation of eleven months arrived\nupon the coast of Indostan, and thus completed a course of discoveries\nwhich had been pursued with great steadiness, and with very little inter-\nruption,fornearlyacenturytogether.\n1213 [7] Some years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in sus-\npenseabouttheprojectsofthePortuguese,ofwhichthesuccessappeared\nyet to be doubtful, a Genoese pilot formed the yet more daring project of\nsailingtotheEastIndiesbytheWest. Thesituationofthosecountrieswas\nat that time very imperfectly known in Europe. The few European trav-\nellers who had been there had magnified the distance, perhaps through\nsimplicityandignorance,whatwasreallyverygreatappearingalmostin-\nfinite to those who could not measure it; or, perhaps, in order to increase\nsomewhatmorethemarvellousoftheirownadventuresinvisitingregions\nso immensely remote from Europe. The longer the way was by the East,\nColumbus very justly concluded, the shorter it would be by the West. He\n432", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nproposed, therefore, to take that way, as both the shortest and the surest,\nand he had the good fortune to convince Isabella of Castile of the probab-\nilityofhisproject. HesailedfromtheportofPalosinAugust1492,nearly\nfive years before the expedition of Vasco de Gama set out from Portugal,\nand,afteravoyageofbetweentwoandthreemonths,discoveredfirstsome\nofthesmallBahamasorLucayanislands,andafterwardsthegreatisland\nofSt.Domingo.\n[8] But the countries which Columbus discovered, either in this or in any\n1214\nofhissubsequentvoyages,hadnoresemblancetothosewhichhehadgone\nin quest of. Instead of the wealth, cultivation, and populousness of China\nand Indostan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other parts of the\nnewworldwhichheevervisited,nothingbutacountryquitecoveredwith\nwood,uncultivated,andinhabitedonlybysometribesofnakedandmiser-\nable savages. He was not very willing, however, to believe that they were\nnotthesamewithsomeofthecountriesdescribedbyMarcoPolo,thefirst\nEuropeanwhohadvisited,oratleasthadleftbehindhim,anydescription\nof China or the East Indies; and a very slight resemblance, such as that\nwhich he found between the name of Cibao, a mountain in St. Domingo,\nandthatofCipangomentionedbyMarcoPolo,wasfrequentlysufficientto\nmake him return to this favourite prepossession, though contrary to the\nclearest evidence. In his letters to Ferdinand and Isabella he called the\ncountries which he had discovered, the Indies. He entertained no doubt G.ed.p560\nbut that they were the extremity of those which had been described by\nMarcoPolo,andthattheywerenotverydistantfromtheGanges,orfrom\nthecountrieswhichhadbeenconqueredbyAlexander. Evenwhenatlast\nconvincedthattheyweredifferent,hestillflatteredhimselfthatthoserich\ncountries were at no great distance, and, in a subsequent voyage, accord-\ningly, went in quest of them along the coast of Terra Firma, and towards\ntheIsthmusofDarien.\n1215 [9] In consequence of this mistake of Columbus, the name of the Indies\nhas stuck to those unfortunate countries ever since; and when it was at\nlastclearlydiscoveredthatthenewwerealtogetherdifferentfromtheold\nIndies, the former were called the West, in contradistinction to the latter,\nwhichwerecalledtheEastIndies.\n1216 [10] ItwasofimportancetoColumbus,however,thatthecountrieswhichhe\nhaddiscovered,whatevertheywere,shouldberepresentedtothecourtof\nSpainasofverygreatconsequence;and,inwhatconstitutestherealriches\nof every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the soil, there\nwasatthattimenothingwhichcouldwelljustifysucharepresentationof\nthem.\n1217 [11] The Cori, something between a rat and a rabbit, and supposed by\nMr. Buffon to be the same with the Aperea of Brazil, was the largest vi-\nviparous quadruped in St. Domingo. This species seems never to have\nbeen very numerous, and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are said to\nhave long ago almost entirely extirpated it, as well as some other tribes\n433", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nofa stillsmallersize. These, however, togetherwith aprettylargelizard,\ncalled the ivana, or iguana, constituted the principal part of the animal\nfoodwhichthelandafforded.\n1218 [12] The vegetable food of the inhabitants, though from their want of in-\ndustry not very abundant, was not altogether so scanty. It consisted in\nIndian corn, yams, potatoes, bananas, etc., plants which were then alto-\ngether unknown in Europe, and which have never since been very much\nesteemed in it, or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn\nfrom the common sorts of grain and pulse, which have been cultivated in\nthispartoftheworldtimeoutofmind.\n1219 [13] The cotton plant, indeed, afforded the material of a very important\nmanufacture, and was at that time to Europeans undoubtedly the most\nvaluable of all the vegetable productions of those islands. But though\nin the end of the fifteenth century the muslins and other cotton goods of\nthe East Indies were much esteemed in every part of Europe, the cotton\nmanufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of it. Even this produc- G.ed.p561\ntion, therefore, could not at that time appear in the eyes of Europeans to\nbeofverygreatconsequence.\n1220 [14] Finding nothing either in the animals or vegetables of the newly dis-\ncovered countries which could justify a very advantageous representation\nof them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals; and in the\nrichness of the productions of this third kingdom, he flattered himself he\nhad found a full compensation for the insignificancy of those of the other\ntwo. The little bits of gold with which the inhabitants ornamented their\ndress, and which, he was informed, they frequently found in the rivulets\nand torrents that fell from the mountains, were sufficient to satisfy him\nthatthosemountainsaboundedwiththerichestgoldmines. St.Domingo,\ntherefore, was represented as a country abounding with gold, and, upon\nthataccount,(accordingtotheprejudicesnotonlyofthepresenttime,but\nof those times) an inexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and\nkingdom of Spain. When Columbus, upon his return from his first voy-\nage, was introduced with a sort of triumphal honours to the sovereigns of\nCastile and Arragon, the principal productions of the countries which he\nhad discovered were carried in solemn procession before him. The only\nvaluable part of them consisted in some little fillets, bracelets, and other\nornaments of gold, and in some bales of cotton. The rest were mere ob-\njects of vulgar wonder and curiosity; some reeds of an extraordinary size,\nsomebirdsofaverybeautifulplumage,andsomestuffedskinsofthehuge\nalligator and manati; all of which were preceded by six or seven of the\nwretched natives, whose singular colour and appearance added greatly to\nthenoveltyoftheshew.\n[15] In consequence of the representations of Columbus, the council of\n1221\nCastile determined to take possession of countries of which the inhabit-\nants were plainly incapable of defending themselves. The pious purpose\nof converting them to Christianity sanctified the injustice of the project.\n434", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nBut the hope of finding treasures of gold there was the sole motive which\npromptedhimtoundertakeit;andtogivethismotivethegreaterweight,\nit was proposed by Columbus that the half of all the gold and silver that\nshould be found there should belong to the crown. This proposal was ap-\nprovedofbythecouncil.\n[16] Aslongasthewholeorthefargreaterpartofthegold, whichthefirst\n1222\nadventurers imported into Europe, was got by so very easy a method as\ntheplunderingofthedefencelessnatives,itwasnotperhapsverydifficult\ntopayeventhisheavytax. Butwhenthenativeswereoncefairlystripped\nof all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in all the other countries\ndiscovered by Columbus, was done completely in six or eight years, and\nwhen in order to find more it had become necessary to dig for it in the G.ed.p562\nmines,therewasnolongeranypossibilityofpayingthistax.

But the\nfirstadventurersdonotappeartohavebeenmuchinterestedaboutsilver.\nNothinglesspreciousthangoldseemedworthyoftheirattention.\n1223 [17] AlltheotherenterprisesoftheSpaniardsinthenewworld,subsequent\nto those of Columbus, seem to have been prompted by the same motive.\nIt was the sacred thirst of gold that carried Oieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco\nNugnesdeBalboa,totheIsthmusofDarien,thatcarriedCorteztoMexico,\nand Almagro and Pizzarro to Chili and Peru. When those adventurers\narrived upon any unknown coast, their first inquiry was always if there\nwas any gold to be found there; and according to the information which\nthey received concerning this particular, they determined either to quit\nthecountryortosettleinit.\n[18] Of all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring\n1224\nbankruptcyuponthegreaterpartofthepeoplewhoengageinthem,there\nis none perhaps more ruinous than the search after new silver and gold\nmines.

Projects of mining, instead of replacing the capital\nemployed in them, together with the ordinary profits of stock, commonly\nabsorb both capital and profit. They are the projects, therefore, to which\nof all others a prudent lawgiver, who desired to increase the capital of his\nnation, would least choose to give any extraordinary encouragement, or\nto turn towards them a greater share of that capital than that would go\nto them of its own accord. Such in reality is the absurd confidence which\nalmostallmenhaveintheirowngoodfortunethat,whereverthereisthe\n435", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nleastprobabilityofsuccess,toogreatashareofitisapttogotothemofits\nownaccord.\n1225 [19] But though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning G.ed.p563\nsuch projects has always been extremely unfavourable, that of human\navidity has commonly been quite otherwise. The same passion which has\nsuggestedtosomanypeopletheabsurdideaofthephilosopher\u2019sstone,has\nsuggested to others the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of gold\nandsilver. Theydidnotconsiderthatthevalueofthosemetalshas,inall\nagesandnations,arisenchieflyfromtheirscarcity,andthattheirscarcity\nhas arisen from the very small quantities of them which nature has any-\nwhere deposited in one place, from the hard and intractable substances\nwith which she has almost everywhere surrounded those small quantit-\nies, and consequently from the labour and expense which are everywhere\nnecessary in order to penetrate to and get at them. They flattered them-\nselves that veins of those metals might in many places be found as large\nand as abundant as those which are commonly found of lead, or copper,\nor tin, or iron. The dream of Sir Walter Raleigh concerning the golden\ncity and country of Eldorado, may satisfy us that even wise men are not\nalways exempt from such strange delusions. More than a hundred years\nafter the death of that great man, the Jesuit Gumila was still convinced\noftherealityofthatwonderfulcountry,andexpressedwithgreatwarmth,\nandIdaretosaywithgreatsincerity,howhappyheshouldbetocarrythe\nlight of the gospel to a people who could so well reward the pious labours\noftheirmissionary.\n1226 [20] In the countries first discovered by the Spaniards, no gold or silver\nmines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the work-\ning. The quantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said\nto have found there had probably been very much magnified, as well as\nthe fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the first\ndiscovery. What those adventurers were reported to have found, however,\nwas sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their countrymen. Every Span-\niardwhosailedtoAmericaexpectedtofindanEldorado.

Theycarry\nout with them, too, the habit of subordination, some notion of the regular G.ed.p565\ngovernment which takes place in their own country, of the system of laws\nwhichsupportit, andofaregularadministrationofjustice; andtheynat-\nurally establish something of the same kind in the new settlement. But\namongsavageandbarbarousnations,thenaturalprogressoflawandgov-\nernment is still slower than the natural progress of arts, after law and\ngovernment have been go far established as is necessary for their protec-\ntion. Everycolonistgetsmorelandthanhecanpossiblycultivate. Hehas\nno rent, and scarce any taxes to pay. No landlord shares with him in its\nproduce, and the share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle. He has\nevery motive to render as great as possible a produce, which is thus to be\nalmostentirelyhisown. Buthislandiscommonlysoextensivethat,with\nall his own industry, and with all the industry of other people whom he\ncan get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of what\nit is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect labourers from\nall quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal wages. But those\nliberalwages,joinedtotheplentyandcheapnessofland,soonmakethose\n437", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlabourers leave him, in order to become landlords themselves, and to re-\nward, with equal liberality, other labourers, who soon leave them for the\nsamereasonthattheylefttheirfirstmaster. Theliberalrewardoflabour\nencouragesmarriage. Thechildren,duringthetenderyearsofinfancy,are\nwellfedandproperlytakencareof,andwhentheyaregrownup,thevalue\nof their labour greatly overpays their maintenance. When arrived at ma-\nturity, the high price of labour, and the low price of land, enable them to\nestablishthemselvesinthesamemannerastheirfathersdidbeforethem.\n1231 [3] In other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior\norders of people oppress the inferior one. But in new colonies the interest\nofthetwosuperiorordersobligesthemtotreattheinferioronewithmore\ngenerosityandhumanity;atleastwherethatinferioroneisnotinastate\nofslavery. Wastelandsof thegreatest natural fertilityare to behad fora\ntrifle. Theincreaseofrevenuewhichtheproprietor,whoisalwaystheun-\ndertaker, expects from their improvement, constitutes his profit which in\nthese circumstances is commonly very great. But this great profit cannot G.ed.p566\nbemadewithoutemployingthelabourofotherpeopleinclearingandcul-\ntivating the land; and the disproportion between the great extent of the\nland and the small number of the people, which commonly takes place in\nnew colonies, makes it difficult for him to get this labour. He does not,\ntherefore, dispute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any\nprice. Thehighwagesoflabourencouragepopulation. Thecheapnessand\nplenty of good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to\npay those high wages. In those wages consists almost the whole price of\ntheland;andthoughtheyarehighconsideredasthewagesoflabour,they\nare low considered as the price of what is so very valuable. What encour-\nages the progress of population and improvement encourages that of real\nwealthandgreatness.\n1232 [4] TheprogressofmanyoftheancientGreekcoloniestowardswealthand\ngreatness seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the course of\na century or two, several of them appear to have rivalled, and even to\nhave surpassed their mother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily,\nTarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear\nby all accounts to have been at least equal to any of the cities of ancient\nGreece. Thoughposteriorintheirestablishment,yetalltheartsofrefine-\nment, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence seem to have been cultivated as\nearly, and to have been improved as highly in them as in any part of the\nmother country. The schools of the two oldest Greek philosophers, those\nof Thales and Pythagoras, were established, it is remarkable, not in an- G.ed.p567\ncient Greece, but the one in an Asiatic, the other in an Italian colony.

Some\nof them, indeed, such as Florence, have in the course of many ages, and\nafter the fall of the mother city, grown up to be considerable states. But\nthe progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid. They\nwereallestablishedinconqueredprovinces,whichinmostcaseshadbeen\nfully inhabited before. The quantity of land assigned to each colonist was\nseldom very considerable, and as the colony was not independent, they\nwere not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way they\njudgedwasmostsuitabletotheirowninterest.\n1234 [6] Intheplentyofgoodland,theEuropeancoloniesestablishedinAmer-\nica and the West Indies resemble, and even greatly surpass, those of an-\ncient Greece.

These numbers exceed greatly\nthose of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, the three greatest cities of\nthe English colonies. Before the conquest of the Spaniards there were no\ncattle fit for draught either in Mexico or Peru. The llama was their only\nbeast of burden, and its strength seems to have been a good deal inferior\nto that of a common ass. The plough was unknown among them. They\nwereignorantoftheuseofiron.

The Dutch\nthen,asenemiestotheSpaniards,becamefriendstothePortuguese,who\nwere likewise the enemies of the Spaniards. They agreed, therefore, to\nleavethatpartofBrazil,whichtheyhadnotconquered,totheKingofPor-\ntugal,whoagreedtoleavethatpartwhichtheyhadconqueredtothem,as\na matter not worth disputing about with such good allies. But the Dutch\ngovernment soon began to oppress the Portuguese colonists, who, instead\nofamusingthemselveswithcomplaints,tookarmsagainsttheirnewmas-\nters,andbytheirownvalourandresolution,withtheconnivance,indeed,\nbut without any avowed assistance from the mother country, drove them\nout of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore, finding it impossible to keep any part\nofthecountrytothemselves,werecontentedthatitshouldbeentirelyre-\nstored to the crown of Portugal. In this colony there are said to be more\n440", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthan six hundred thousand people, either Portuguese or descended from\nPortuguese,creoles,mulattoes,andamixedracebetweenPortugueseand\nBrazilians. No one colony in America is supposed to contain so great a\nnumberofpeopleofEuropeanextraction.\n1237 [9] Towards the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the\nsixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers\nupontheocean;forthoughthecommerceofVeniceextendedtoeverypart\nofEurope,itsfleetshadscarceeversailedbeyondtheMediterranean. The\nSpaniards, in virtue of the first discovery, claimed all America as their\nown; and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as that of\nPortugalfromsettlinginBrazil,suchwas,atthattime,theterroroftheir\nname, that the greater part of the other nations of Europe were afraid to\nestablishthemselvesinanyotherpartofthatgreatcontinent. TheFrench,\nwho attempted to settle in Florida, were all murdered by the Spaniards.\nButthedeclensionofthenavalpowerofthislatternation,inconsequence\nof the defeat or miscarriage of what they called their Invincible Armada,\nwhich happened towards the end of the sixteenth century, put it out of\ntheir power to obstruct any longer the settlements of the other European G.ed.p570\nnations. In the course of the seventeenth century, therefore, the English,\nFrench,Dutch,Danes,andSwedes,allthegreatnationswhohadanyports\nupontheocean,attemptedtomakesomesettlementsinthenewworld.\n1238 [10] The Swedes established themselves in New Jersey; and the number\nof Swedish families still to be found there sufficiently demonstrates that\nthiscolonywasverylikelytoprosperhaditbeenprotectedbythemother\ncountry. But being neglected by Sweden, it was soon swallowed up by the\nDutch colony of New York, which again, in 1674, fell under the dominion\noftheEnglish.\n1239 [11] The small islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz are the only coun-\ntriesinthenewworldthathaveeverbeenpossessedBytheDanes. These\nlittle settlements, too, were under the government of an exclusive com-\npany, which had the sole right, both of purchasing the surplus produce of\nthecolonists,andofsupplyingthemwithsuchgoodsofothercountriesas\nthey wanted, and which, therefore, both in its purchases and sales, had\nnot only the power of oppressing them, but the greatest temptation to do\nso. Thegovernmentofanexclusivecompanyofmerchantsis,perhaps,the\nworst of all governments for any country whatever. It was not, however,\nabletostopaltogethertheprogressofthesecolonies,thoughitrenderedit\nmoreslowandlanguid. ThelateKingofDenmarkdissolvedthiscompany,\nandsincethattimetheprosperityofthesecolonieshasbeenverygreat.\n1240 [12] TheDutchsettlementsintheWest,aswellasthoseintheEastIndies,\nwere originally put under the government of an exclusive company. The\nprogress of some of them, therefore, though it has been considerable, in\ncomparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled\nandestablished,hasbeenlanguidandslowincomparisonwiththatofthe\ngreater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very consid-\n441", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nerable,isstillinferiortothegreaterpartofthesugarcoloniesoftheother\nEuropean nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now divided into the two\nprovincesofNewYorkandNewJersey,wouldprobablyhavesoonbecome\nconsiderabletoo,eventhoughithadremainedunderthegovernmentofthe\nDutch.

Thisrelaxationintheexclusive\nprivileges of the company is probably the principal cause of that degree\nof prosperity which that colony at present enjoys. Curacoa and Eustatia,\nthetwoprincipalislandsbelongingtotheDutch,arefreeportsopentothe\nshipsofallnations;andthisfreedom,inthemidstofbettercolonieswhose\nports are open to those of one nation only, has been the great cause of the\nprosperityofthosetwobarrenislands.\n[13] The French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the last\n1241\ncentury, and some part of the present, under the government of an ex-\nclusive company. Under so unfavourable an administration its progress\nwas necessarily very slow in comparison with that of other new colonies;\nbut it became much more rapid when this company was dissolved after\nthe fall of what is called the Mississippi scheme. When the English got\npossession of this country, they found in it near double the number of in-\nhabitantswhichFatherCharlevoixhadassignedtoitbetweentwentyand\nthirtyyearsbefore.

During this period the\npopulation and improvement of this colony increased very fast. Even the\noppressionoftheexclusivecompany,towhichitwasforsometimesubjec-\nted,withalltheothercoloniesofFrance,thoughitnodoubtretarded,had\nnot been able to stop its progress altogether. The course of its prosperity\nreturned as soon as it was relieved from that oppression.

But the political institutions of\nthe English colonies have been more favourable to the improvement and\ncultivationofthislandthanthoseofanyoftheotherthreenations.\n1246 [18] First, the engrossing of uncultivated land, though it has by no means\nbeenpreventedaltogether,hasbeenmorerestrainedintheEnglishcolon-\niesthaninanyother. Thecolonylawwhichimposesuponeveryproprietor\nthe obligation of improving and cultivating, within a limited time, a cer-\ntain proportion of his lands, and which in case of failure, declares those\nneglectedlandsgrantabletoanyotherperson,thoughithasnot,perhaps,\nbeenverystrictlyexecuted,has,however,hadsomeeffect.\n1247 [19] Secondly,inPennsylvaniathereisnorightofprimogeniture,andlands,\nlikemovables,aredividedequallyamongallthechildrenofthefamily.

The French colonies, indeed,\nare subject to the custom of Paris, which, in the inheritance of land, is\nmuch more favourable to the younger children than the law of England.\nBut in the French colonies, if any part of an estate, held by the noble ten-\nureofchivalryandhomage,isalienated,itis,foralimitedtime,subjectto\ntherightofredemption,eitherbytheheirofthesuperiororbytheheirof\nthefamily;andallthelargestestatesofthecountryareheldbysuchnoble\ntenures, which necessarily embarrass alienation. But in a new colony a\ngreatuncultivatedestateislikelytobemuchmorespeedilydividedbyali- G.ed.p573\nenationthanbysuccession. Theplentyandcheapnessofgoodland,ithas\nalready been observed, are the principal causes of the rapid prosperity of\nnew colonies. The engrossing of land, in effect, destroys this plenty and\ncheapness. The engrossing of uncultivated land, besides, is the greatest\nobstructiontoitsimprovement. Butthelabourthatisemployedintheim-\nprovement and cultivation of land affords the greatest and most valuable\n1[Smith]JusMajoratus.\n443", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nproduce to the society. The produce of labour, in this case, pays not only\nitsownwages,andtheprofitofthestockwhichemploysit,buttherentof\nthe land too upon which it is employed. The labour of the English colon-\nists, therefore, being more employed in the improvement and cultivation\nof land, is likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce than that\nofanyoftheotherthreenations,which,bytheengrossingofland,ismore\norlessdivertedtowardsotheremployments.\n1248 [20] Thirdly,thelabouroftheEnglishcolonistsisnotonlylikelytoafforda\ngreaterandmorevaluableproduce,but,inconsequenceofthemoderation\nof their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs to themselves,\nwhichtheymaystoreupandemployinputtingintomotionastillgreater\nquantity of labour. The English colonists have never yet contributed any-\nthing towards the defence of the mother country, or towards the support\nof its civil government. They themselves, on the contrary, have hitherto\nbeen defended almost entirely at the expense of the mother country. But\nthe expense of fleets and armies is out of all proportion greater than the\nnecessaryexpenseofcivilgovernment. Theexpenseoftheirowncivilgov-\nernment has always been very moderate. It has generally been confined\nto what was necessary for paying competent salaries to the governor, to\nthe judges, and to some other officers of police, and for maintaining a few\nof the most useful public works. The expense of the civil establishment\nof Massachusetts Bay, before the commencement of the present disturb-\nances, used to be but about 18,000l. a year. That of New Hampshire and\nRhode Island, 3,500l. each. That of Connecticut, 4,000l. That of New York\nand Pennsylvania, 4,500l. each. That of New Jersey, 1,200l. That of Vir-\nginia and South Carolina, 8,000l. each. The civil establishments of Nova\nScotiaandGeorgiaarepartlysupportedbyanannualgrantofParliament.\nBut Nova Scotia pays, besides, about 7,000l. a year towards the public ex- G.ed.p574\npensesofthecolony;andGeorgiaabout2,500l.ayear.

Themost\nimportant part of the expense of government, indeed, that of defence and\nprotection, has constantly fallen upon the mother country. The ceremo-\nnial, too, of the civil government in the colonies, upon the reception of\na new governor, upon the opening of a new assembly, etc., though suffi-\nciently decent, is not accompanied with any expensive pomp or parade.\nTheir ecclesiastical government is conducted upon a plan equally frugal.\nTithesareunknownamongthem;andtheirclergy,whoarefarfrombeing\nnumerous, are maintained either by moderate stipends, or by the volun-\ntary contributions of the people. The power of Spain and Portugal, on the\ncontrary, derives some support from the taxes levied upon their colonies.\nFrance,indeed,hasneverdrawnanyconsiderablerevenuefromitscolon-\n444", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nies,thetaxeswhichitleviesuponthembeinggenerallyspentamongthem.\nBut the colony government of all these three nations is conducted upon a\nmuch more expensive ceremonial. The sums spent upon the reception of\na new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently been enormous. Such\nceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich colonists upon those\nparticular occasions, but they serve to introduce among them the habit of\nvanityandexpenseuponallotheroccasions. Theyarenotonlyverygriev-\nous occasional taxes, but they contribute to establish perpetual taxes of\nthesamekindstillmoregrievous;theruinoustaxesofprivateluxuryand\nextravagance. Inthecoloniesofallthosethreenationstoo,theecclesiast-\nical government is extremely oppressive. Tithes take place in all of them,\nand are levied with the utmost rigour in those of Spain and Portugal.

Over\nandaboveallthis,theclergyare,inallofthem,thegreatestengrossersof\nland.\n1249 [21] Fourthly, in the disposal of their surplus produce, or of what is over\nand above their own consumption, the English colonies have been more\nfavoured, and have been allowed a more extensive market, than those of G.ed.p575\nanyotherEuropeannation. EveryEuropeannationhasendeavouredmore\norlessto monopolise to itselfthecommerceofitscolonies, and, uponthat\naccount, hasprohibitedtheshipsofforeignnationsfromtradingtothem,\nandhasprohibitedthemfromimportingEuropeangoodsfromanyforeign\nnation. But the manner in which this monopoly has been exercised in\ndifferentnationshasbeenverydifferent.\n1250 [22] Some nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to\nan exclusive company, of whom the colonists were obliged to buy all such\nEuropeangoodsastheywanted,andtowhomtheywereobligedtosellthe\nwhole of their own surplus produce. It was the interest of the company,\ntherefore,notonlytoselltheformerasdear,andtobuythelatterascheap\nas possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at this low price than\nwhat they could dispose of for a very high price in Europe. It was their\ninterest, not only to degrade in all cases the value of the surplus produce\nof the colony, but in many cases to discourage and keep down the natural\nincrease of its quantity. Of all the expedients that can well be contrived\nto stunt the natural growth of a new colony, that of an exclusive company\nis undoubtedly the most effectual. This, however, has been the policy of\nHolland, though their company, in the course of the present century, has\ngiven up in many respects the exertion of their exclusive privilege. This,\ntoo, was the policy of Denmark till the reign of the late king. It has occa-\nsionallybeenthepolicyofFrance,andoflate,since1755,afterithadbeen\nabandoned by all other nations on account of its absurdity, it has become\n445", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthepolicyofPortugalwithregardatleasttotwooftheprincipalprovinces\nofBrazil,FernambucoandMarannon.\n1251 [23] Other nations, without establishing an exclusive company, have con-\nfined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of the\nmother country, from whence no ship was allowed to sail, but either in\nafleetandataparticularseason,or,ifsingle,inconsequenceofaparticu-\nlarlicence,whichinmostcaseswasverywellpaidfor. Thispolicyopened,\nindeed, the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother country,\nprovidedtheytradedfromtheproperport,attheproperseason,andinthe\npropervessels. Butasallthedifferentmerchants,whojoinedtheirstocks G.ed.p576\nin order to fit out those licensed vessels, would find it for their interest to\nact in concert, the trade which was carried on in this manner would ne-\ncessarily be conducted very nearly upon the same principles as that of an\nexclusivecompany. Theprofitofthosemerchantswouldbealmostequally\nexorbitant and oppressive. The colonies would be ill supplied, and would\nbeobligedbothtobuyverydear,andtosellverycheap. This,however,till\nwithinthesefewyears,hadalwaysbeenthepolicyofSpain,andtheprice\nof all European goods, accordingly, is said to have been enormous in the\nSpanish West Indies. At Quito, we are told by Ulloa, a pound of iron sold\nfor about four and sixpence, and a pound of steel for about six and nine-\npence sterling. But it is chiefly in order to purchase European goods that\nthecoloniespartwiththeirownproduce. Themore,therefore,theypayfor\nthe one, the less they really get for the other, and the dearness of the one\nis the same thing with the cheapness of the other. The policy of Portugal\nisinthisrespectthesameastheancientpolicyofSpainwithregardtoall\nits colonies, except Fernambuco and Marannon, and with regard to these\nithaslatelyadoptedastillworse.\n1252 [24] Othernationsleavethetradeoftheircoloniesfreetoalltheirsubjects\nwhomaycarryitonfromallthedifferentportsofthemothercountry,and\nwhohaveoccasionfornootherlicencethanthecommondespatchesofthe\ncustom-house. In this case the number and dispersed situation of the dif-\nferenttradersrendersitimpossibleforthemtoenterintoanygeneralcom-\nbination, and their competition is sufficient to hinder them from making\nvery exorbitant profits. Under so liberal a policy the colonies are enabled\nbothtoselltheirownproduceandtobuythegoodsofEuropeatareason-\nable price. But since the dissolution of the Plymouth Company, when our\ncolonies were but in their infancy, this has always been the policy of Eng-\nland. Ithasgenerally,too,beenthatofFrance,andhasbeenuniformlyso\nsincethedissolutionofwhat,inEngland,iscommonlycalledtheirMissis-\nsippiCompany. Theprofitsofthetrade,therefore,whichFranceandEng-\nlandcarryonwiththeircolonies,thoughnodoubtsomewhathigherthanif\nthecompetitionwasfreetoallothernations,are,however,bynomeansex- G.ed.p577\norbitant;andthepriceofEuropeangoodsaccordinglyisnotextravagantly\nhighinthegreaterpartofthecoloniesofeitherofthosenations.\n1253 [25] In the exportation of their own surplus produce too, it is only with re-\n446", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngardtocertaincommoditiesthatthecoloniesofGreatBritainareconfined\ntothemarketofthemothercountry.

Byallowingthecoloniesaveryextensivemarket\nfor their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate improvement by raising\nthe price of a commodity which would otherwise be of little value, and\nthereby enabling them to make some profit of what would otherwise be a\nmereexpense.\n1257 [29] In a country neither half-peopled nor half-cultivated, cattle naturally\nmultiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants, and are often upon\nthat account of little or no value. But it is necessary, it has already been\nshown, that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to that of\ncorn before the greater part of the lands of any country can be improved.\nByallowingtoAmericancattle,inallshapes,deadoralive,averyextens-\nive market, the law endeavors to raise the value of a commodity of which\nthehighpriceissoveryessentialtoimprovement.

Those fisheries, upon this G.ed.p578\naccount, have had all the encouragement which freedom can give them,\nand they have flourished accordingly. The New England fishery in partic-\nularwas,beforethelatedisturbances,oneofthemostimportant,perhaps,\nin the world.

Itwasprobablynotso\nmuchfromanyregardtotheinterestofAmericaasfromajealousyofthis\ninterference that those important commodities have not only been kept\nout of the enumeration, but that the importation into Great Britain of all\ngrain, except rice, and of salt provisions, has, in the ordinary state of the\nlaw,beenprohibited.\n1262 [34] The non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all G.ed.p579\nparts of the world. Lumber and rice, having been once put into the enu-\nmeration, when they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to\nthe European market, to the countries that lie south of Cape Finisterre.\nBythe6thofGeorgeIII.c.52,allnon-enumeratedcommoditiesweresub-\njected to the like restriction.

The importation of commod-\nities of the second kind might be so managed too, it was supposed, as to\ninterfere,notwiththesaleofthoseofthesamekindwhichwereproduced\nat home, but with that of those which were imported from foreign coun-\ntries; because, by means of proper duties, they might be rendered always\nsomewhat dearer than the former, and yet a good deal cheaper than the\nlatter. By confining such commodities to the home market, therefore, it\nwasproposedtodiscouragetheproduce, not ofGreat Britain, butofsome\nforeigncountrieswithwhichthebalanceoftradewasbelievedtobeunfa-\nvourabletoGreatBritain.\n1264 [36] The prohibition of exporting from the colonies, to any other country\nbut Great Britain, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpen-\ntine, naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies, and G.ed.p580\nconsequentlytoincreasetheexpenseofclearingtheirlands, theprincipal\nobstacletotheirimprovement.

The more advanced or more refined manufactures even of\nthe colony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain\nchoose to reserve to themselves, and have prevailed upon the legislature\nto prevent their establishment in the colonies, sometimes by high duties,\nandsometimesbyabsoluteprohibitions.\n1269 [41] While, for example, Muskovado sugars from the British plantations\npay upon importation only 6s.4d. the hundredweight; white sugars pay\n1l.1s.1d.; and refined, either double or single, in loaves 4l.2s.5 8 d. When\n20\nthose high duties were imposed, Great Britain was the sole, and she still\ncontinues to be the principal market to which the sugars of the British\ncolonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a prohibition, at\nfirst of claying or refining sugar for any foreign market, and at present of\nclaying or refining it for the market, which takes off, perhaps, more than\nnine-tenths of the whole produce. The manufacture of claying or refin-\ning sugar accordingly, though it has flourished in all the sugar colonies of\nFrance,hasbeenlittlecultivatedinanyofthoseofEnglandexceptforthe\nmarket of the colonies themselves. While Grenada was in the hands of\nthe French there was a refinery of sugar, by claying at least, upon almost\nevery plantation. Since it fell into those of the English, almost all works\nof this kind have been given tip, and there are at present, October 1773,\nI am assured not above two or three remaining in the island.

No independent foreign country, it was easy to fore-\nsee, would receive them if they came to it loaded with the heavy duties\nto which almost all foreign goods are subjected on their importation into\nGreatBritain.

Wemustnotwonder,therefore,if,inthegreaterpartofthem,their\ninterest has been more considered than either that of the colonies or that\nof the mother country. In their exclusive privilege of supplying the colon-\nies with all the goods which they wanted from Europe, and of purchasing\nall such parts of their surplus produce as could not interfere with any of\nthe trades which they themselves carried on at home, the interest of the\ncolonies was sacrificed to the interest of those merchants. In allowing the\nsame drawbacks upon the re-exportation of the greater part of European\nand East India goods to the colonies as upon their re-exportation to any\nindependent country, the interest of the mother country was sacrificed to\nit, even according to the mercantile ideas of that interest. It was for the\ninterest of the merchants to pay as little as possible for the foreign which\nthey sent to the colonies, and, consequently, to get back as much as pos-\nsibleofthedutieswhichtheyadvancedupontheirimportationintoGreat\nBritain. They might thereby be enabled to sell in the colonies either the\nsamequantityofgoodswithagreaterprofit,oragreaterquantitywiththe\nsameprofit,and,consequently,togainsomethingeitherintheonewayor\nthe other.

The authority of this assembly overawes the executive power, and\nneither the meanest nor the most obnoxious colonist, as long as he obeys\nthe law, has anything to fear from the resentment, either of the governor\nor of any other civil or military officer in the province.

Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the\ncolony assemblies had not only the legislative but a part of the executive\npower. InConnecticutandRhodeIsland,theyelectedthegovernor. Inthe\nother colonies they appointed the revenue officers who collected the taxes\nimposedbythoserespectiveassemblies,towhomthoseofficerswereimme-\ndiately responsible. There is more equality, therefore, among the English\ncolonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country. Their man-\nners are more republican, and their governments, those of three of the\nprovinces of New England in particular, have hitherto been more repub-\nlicantoo.\n1280 [52] The absolute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the con- G.ed.p586\ntrary,takeplaceintheircolonies;andthediscretionarypowerswhichsuch\ngovernments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on ac-\ncount of the great distance, naturally exercised there with more than or-\ndinary violence. Under all absolute governments there is more liberty in\nthe capital than in any other part of the country.

But the European colon-\nies in America are more remote than the most distant provinces of the\ngreatest empires which had ever been known before. The government of\ntheEnglishcoloniesisperhapstheonlyonewhich,sincetheworldbegan,\ncouldgiveperfectsecuritytotheinhabitantsofsoverydistantaprovince.\nThe administration of the French colonies, however, has always been con-\nductedwithmoregentlenessandmoderationthanthatoftheSpanishand\nPortugese. This superiority of conduct is suitable both to the character of\nthe French nation, and to what forms the character of every nation, the\nnature of their government, which though arbitrary and violent in com-\nparison with that of Great Britain, is legal and free in comparison with\nthoseofSpainandPortugal.\n1281 [53] It is in the progress of the North American colonies, however, that the\nsuperiorityoftheEnglishpolicychieflyappears. Theprogressofthesugar\ncoloniesofFrancehasbeenatleastequal,perhapssuperior,tothatofthe\ngreater part of those of England, and yet the sugar colonies of England\nenjoy a free government nearly of the same kind with that which takes\nplace in her colonies of North America. But the sugar colonies of France\narenotdiscouraged, likethoseofEngland, fromrefiningtheirownsugar;\nand, what is of still greater importance, the genius of their government\nnaturallyintroducesabettermanagementoftheirnegroslaves.\n1282 [54] In all European colonies the culture of the sugar-cane is carried on by\nnegro slaves. The constitution of those who have been born in the tem-\nperate climate of Europe could not, it is supposed, support the labour of\ndigging the ground under the burning sun of the West Indies; and the\nculture of the sugarcane, as it is managed at present, is all hand labour,\nthough, in the opinion of many, the drill plough might be introduced into\nit with great advantage. But, as the profit and success of the cultivation\nwhich is carried on by means of cattle, depend very much upon the good\nmanagementofthosecattle,sotheprofitandsuccessofthatwhichiscar- G.ed.p587\nriedonbyslavesmustdependequallyuponthegoodmanagementofthose\nslaves; andinthegoodmanagementoftheirslavestheFrenchplanters,I\nthink it is generally allowed, are superior to the English. The law, so far\nas it gives some weak protection to the slave against the violence of his\nmaster, is likely to be better executed in a colony where the government\nis in a great measure arbitrary than in one where it is altogether free. In\neverycountrywheretheunfortunatelawofslaveryisestablished,thema-\ngistrate,whenheprotectstheslave,intermeddlesinsomemeasureinthe\nmanagement of the private property of the master; and, in a free country,\nwherethemasterisperhapseitheramemberofthecolonyassembly,oran\nelectorofsuchamember,hedarenotdothisbutwiththegreatestcaution\nand circumspection.

IntheRomanhistory,thefirsttimewereadofthemagistrateinter-\nposingtoprotecttheslavefromtheviolenceofhismasterisundertheem-\nperors. WhenVediusPollio,inthepresenceofAugustus,orderedoneofhis\nslaves,whohadcommittedaslightfault,tobecutintopiecesandthrown\nintohisfishpondinordertofeedhisfishes,theemperorcommandedhim,\nwith indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that slave, but all\nthe others that belonged to him. Under the republic no magistrate could G.ed.p588\nhave had authority enough to protect the slave, much less to punish the\nmaster.\n1284 [56] The stock, it is to be observed, which has improved the sugar colonies\nof France, particularly the great colony of St. Domingo, has been raised\nalmost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of those\ncolonies. It has been almost altogether the produce of the soil and of the\nindustry of the colonies, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of\nthat produce gradually accumulated by good management, and employed\nin raising a still greater produce. But the stock which has improved and\ncultivated the sugar colonies of England has, a great part of it, been sent\nout from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce of\nthe soil and industry of the colonists. The prosperity of the English sugar\ncolonieshasbeen,inagreatmeasure,owingtothegreatrichesofEngland,\nofwhichaparthasoverflowed,ifonemaysayso,uponthosecolonies.

All such countries have evidently gained a\nmore extensive market for their surplus produce, and must consequently\nhavebeenencouragedtoincreaseitsquantity.\n1299 [7] But that those great events should likewise have contributed to en-\ncourage the industry of countries, such as Hungary and Poland, which\nmaynever,perhaps,havesentasinglecommodityoftheirownproduceto\nAmerica, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident. That those events have\ndoneso,however,cannotbedoubted. SomepartoftheproduceofAmerica\nis consumed in Hungary and Poland, and there is some demand there for\nthe sugar, chocolate, and tobacco of that new quarter of the world. But G.ed.p592\nthose commodities must be purchased with something which is either the\nproduce of the industry of Hungary and Poland, or with something which\nhad been purchased with some part of that produce. Those commodities\nofAmericaarenewvalues,newequivalents,introducedintoHungaryand\nPoland to be exchanged there for the surplus produce of those countries.\nBy being carried thither they create a new and more extensive market\nfor that surplus produce. They raise its value, and thereby contribute to\nencourageitsincrease. ThoughnopartofitmayeverbecarriedtoAmer-\nica, it may be carried to other countries which purchase it with a part of\ntheirshareofthesurplusproduceofAmerica;anditmayfindamarketby\nmeansofthecirculationofthattradewhichwasoriginallyputintomotion\nbythesurplusproduceofAmerica.\n1300 [8] Those great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoy-\nments, and to augment the industry of countries which not only never\nsent any commodities to America, but never received any from it. Even\nsuch countries may have received a greater abundance of other commod-\nities from countries of which the surplus produce had been augmented by\nmeansoftheAmericantrade. Thisgreaterabundance,asitmustnecessar-\nily have increased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented\ntheirindustry. Agreaternumberofnewequivalentsofsomekindorother\nmust have been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus pro-\nduce of that industry. A more extensive market must have been created\nforthatsurplusproducesoastoraiseitsvalue,andtherebyencourageits\nincrease. Themassofcommoditiesannuallythrownintothegreatcircleof\nEuropean commerce, and by its various revolutions annually distributed\namong all the different nations comprehended within it, must have been\naugmented by the whole surplus produce of America. A greater share of\nthisgreatermass,therefore,islikelytohavefallentoeachofthosenations,\ntohaveincreasedtheirenjoyments,andaugmentedtheirindustry.\n1301 [9] The exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or, at\nleast, to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the en-\njoymentsandindustryofallthosenationsingeneral,andoftheAmerican\ncolonies in particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of one of the\ngreat springs which puts into motion a great part of the business of man-\n458", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nkind. By rendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries, it\nlessens its consumption, and thereby cramps the industry of the colonies,\nand both the enjoyments and the industry of all other countries, which\nboth enjoy less when they pay more for what they enjoy, and produce less\nwhentheygetlessforwhattheyproduce. Byrenderingtheproduceofall\nother countries dearer in the colonies, it cramps, in the same manner the\nindustry of all other countries, and both the enjoyments and the industry\nof the colonies. It is a clog which, for the supposed benefit of some par-\nticular countries, embarrasses the pleasures and encumbers the industry\nof all other countries; but of the colonies more than of any other. It not G.ed.p593\nonlyexcludes,asmuchaspossible,allothercountriesfromoneparticular\nmarket; but it confines, as much as Possible, the colonies to one particu-\nlar market; and the difference is very great between being excluded from\noneparticularmarket,whenallothersareopen,andbeingconfinedtoone\nparticularmarket,whenallothersareshutup. Thesurplusproduceofthe\ncolonies, however, is the original source of all that increase of enjoyments\nandindustrywhichEuropederivesfromthediscoveryandcolonizationof\nAmerica; and the exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to render\nthissourcemuchlessabundantthanitotherwisewouldbe.\n1302 [10] The particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from\nthecolonieswhichparticularlybelongtoitareoftwodifferentkinds;first,\nthosecommonadvantageswhicheveryempirederivesfromtheprovinces\nsubject to its dominion; and, secondly, those peculiar advantages which\nare supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the\nEuropeancoloniesofAmerica.\n1303 [11] The common advantages which every empire derives from the\nprovincessubjecttoitsdominionconsist, first, inthemilitaryforcewhich\nthey furnish for its defence; and, secondly, in the revenue which they fur-\nnishforthesupportofitscivilgovernment.

It must be cheaper there-\nfore in England than it can be in any other country, and must contrib-\nute more to increase the enjoyments of England than those of any other\ncountry.

For\nall those parts of her own surplus produce which England exchanges for\nthoseenumeratedcommodities,shemustgetabetterpricethananyother\ncountriescangetforthelikepartsoftheirs,whentheyexchangethemfor\nthe same commodities. The manufacturers of England, for example, will\npurchase a greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her own colonies\nthan the like manufactures of other countries can purchase of that sugar\nand tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England and those\nof other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and tobacco of\nthe English colonies, this superiority of price gives an encouragement to\nthe former beyond what the latter can in these circumstances enjoy. The\nexclusivetradeofthecolonies,therefore,asitdiminishes,oratleastkeeps\ndown below what they would otherwise rise to, both the enjoyments and\ntheindustryofthecountrieswhichdonotpossessit;soitgivesanevident\nadvantagetothecountrieswhichdopossessitoverthoseothercountries.\n1308 [16] Thisadvantage,however,willperhapsbefoundtoberatherwhatmay\nbecalledarelativethananabsoluteadvantage;andtogiveasuperiorityto\nthecountrywhichenjoysitratherbydepressingtheindustryandproduce G.ed.p595\nof other countries than by raising those of that particular country above\nwhattheywouldnaturallyrisetointhecaseofafreetrade.\n1309 [17] The tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of the\nmonopolywhichEnglandenjoysofit,certainlycomescheapertoEngland\nthan it can do to France, to whom England commonly sells a consider-\nable part of it. But had France, and all other European countries been,\nat all times, allowed a free trade to Maryland and Virginia, the tobacco\nof those colonies might, by this time, have come cheaper than it actually\ndoes, not only to all those other countries, but likewise to England.

England, indeed, would not in\nthis case have had any advantage over other countries. She might have\nbought the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper, and consequently\nhave sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer than she actu-\nallydoes. Butshecouldneitherhaveboughttheonecheapernorsoldthe\nother dearer than any other country might have done.

The English capital,\nwhichhadbeforecarriedonbutapartofit,wasnowtocarryonthewhole.\nThe capital which had before supplied the colonies with but a part of the\ngoods which they wanted from Europe was now all that was employed to G.ed.p596\nsupplythemwiththewhole.

The capital which had before bought but a part of the surplus pro-\nduceofthecolonies,wasnowallthatwasemployedtobuythewhole.

Since the estab-\nlishment of the Act of Navigation, accordingly, the colony trade has been\ncontinually increasing, while many other branches of foreign trade, par-\nticularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been continually decaying.\nOur manufactures for foreign sale, instead of being suited, as before the\nAct of Navigation, to the neighbouring market of Europe, or to the more\ndistantoneofthecountrieswhichlieroundtheMediterraneanSea,have,\nthegreaterpartofthem,beenaccommodatedtothestillmoredistantone G.ed.p597\nofthecolonies,tothemarketinwhichtheyhavethemonopolyratherthan\ntothatinwhichtheyhavemanycompetitors.

The mercantile capital of Great Britain,\nthough very great, yet not being infinite, and though greatly increased\nsincetheActofNavigation,yetnotbeingincreasedinthesameproportion\nas the colony trade, that trade could not possibly be carried on without\nwithdrawing some part of that capital from other branches of trade, nor\nconsequentlywithoutsomedecayofthoseotherbranches.\n1315 [23] England, it must be observed, was a great trading country, her mer-\ncantilecapitalwasverygreatandlikelytobecomestillgreaterandgreater\neveryday,notonlybeforetheActofNavigationhadestablishedthemono-\npoly of the colony trade, but before that trade was very considerable. In\nthe Dutch war, during the government of Cromwell, her navy was super-\niortothatofHolland; andinthatwhichbrokeoutinthebeginningofthe\nreign of Charles II, it was at last equal, perhaps superior, to the united\n462", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnavies of France and Holland. Its superiority, perhaps, would scarce ap-\npear greater in the present times; at least if the Dutch navy was to bear\nthe same proportion to the Dutch commerce now which it did then. But\nthis great naval power could not, in either of those wars, be owing to the\nAct of Navigation. During the first of them the plan of that act had been\nbut just formed; and though before the breaking out of the second it had\nbeenfullyenactedbylegalauthority,yetnopartofitcouldhavehadtime\nto produce any considerable effect, and least of all that part which estab-\nlishedtheexclusivetradetothecolonies. Boththecoloniesandtheirtrade\nwere inconsiderable then in comparison of what they are now. The island\nof Jamaica was an unwholesome desert, little inhabited, and less cultiv-\nated. New York and New Jersey were in the possession of the Dutch: the\nhalf of St. Christopher\u2019s in that of the French. The island of Antigua, the\ntwo Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nova Scotia were not planted.\nVirginia,Maryland,andNewEnglandwereplanted;andthoughtheywere\nvery thriving colonies, yet there was not, perhaps, at that time, either in\nEurope or America, a single person who foresaw or even suspected the G.ed.p598\nrapidprogresswhichtheyhavesincemadeinwealth,population,andim-\nprovement. TheislandofBarbadoes,inshort,wastheonlyBritishcolony\nof any consequence of which the condition at that time bore any resemb-\nlancetowhatitisatpresent.

But\nthe share which Great Britain at present enjoys of that trade could not\nsupportanysuchgreatnavalpower.

In consequence of the monopoly, the increase of the colony\ntrade has not so much occasioned an addition to the trade which Great\nBritainhadbeforeasatotalchangeinitsdirection.\n1316 [24] Secondly,thismonopolyhasnecessarilycontributedtokeepuptherate\nof profit in all the different branches of British trade higher than it nat-\nurally would have been had all nations been allowed a free trade to the\nBritishcolonies.\n1317 [25] The monopoly of the colony trade, as it necessarily drew towards that\ntradeagreaterproportionofthecapitalofGreatBritainthanwhatwould\nhavegonetoitofitsownaccord;sobytheexpulsionofallforeigncapitals\nitnecessarilyreducedthewholequantityofcapitalemployedinthattrade\nbelowwhatitnaturallywouldhavebeeninthecaseofafreetrade. But,by\nlesseningthecompetitionofcapitalsinthatbranchoftrade,itnecessarily\n463", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nraised the rate of profit in that branch. By lessening, too, the competition\nof British capitals in all other branches of trade, it necessarily raised the\nrateofBritishprofitinallthoseotherbranches.

Their own country must both buy dearer and\nsell dearer; must both buy less and sell less; must both enjoy less and\nproduceless,thansheotherwisewoulddo.\n1320 [28] It subjects her to a relative disadvantage; because in such branches of\ntrade it sets other countries which are not subject to the same absolute\ndisadvantageeithermoreaboveherorlessbelowherthantheyotherwise\nwould be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more in\nproportion to what she enjoys and produces. It renders their superiority\ngreaterortheirinferioritylessthanitotherwisewouldbe.

They complain of the\nextravagant gain of other people, but they say nothing of their own. The\nhigh profits of British stock, however, may contribute towards raising the\npriceofBritishmanufacturesinmanycasesasmuch,andinsomeperhaps\nmore,thanthehighwagesofBritishlabour.\n1322 [30] It is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may justly\nsay, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part\nofthedifferentbranchesoftradeofwhichshehasnotthemonopoly;from\nthetradeofEuropeinparticular, andfromthatofthecountrieswhichlie\nroundtheMediterraneanSea.\n464", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n1323 [31] Ithaspartlybeendrawnfromthosebranchesoftradebytheattraction\nof superior profit in the colony trade in consequence of the continual in- G.ed.p600\ncreaseofthattrade,andofthecontinualinsufficiencyofthecapitalwhich\nhadcarrieditononeyeartocarryitonthenext.\n1324 [32] It has partly been driven from them by the advantage which the high\nrate of profit, established in Great Britain, gives to other countries in all\nthe different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the mono-\npoly.\n1325 [33] As the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other\nbranches a part of the British capital which would otherwise have been\nemployed in them, so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which\nwouldneverhavegonetothemhadtheynotbeenexpelledfromthecolony\ntrade.

New colonies, it has already been observed, are always under-\nstocked. Their capital is always much less than what they could employ\nwith great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultivation of\ntheirland. Theyhaveaconstantdemand,therefore,formorecapitalthan\ntheyhaveoftheirown;and,inordertosupplythedeficiencyoftheirown,\nthey endeavour to borrow as much as they can of the mother country, to\nwhomtheyare,therefore,alwaysindebt.

But\na British capital of a thousand pounds, for example, which is returned to\nGreat Britain only once in five years, can keep in constant employment\nonly one-fifth part of the British industry which it could maintain if the\nwhole was returned once in the year; and, instead of the quantity of in-\ndustry which a thousand pounds could maintain for a year, can keep in\nconstant employment the quantity only which two hundred pounds can\nmaintainforayear.

But this cannot be done without for-\ncing some part of the capital of Great Britain into a round-about foreign\ntradeofconsumption. MarylandandVirginia,forexample,sendannually\ntoGreatBritainupwardsofninety-sixthousandhogsheadsoftobacco,and\ntheconsumptionofGreatBritainissaidnottoexceedfourteenthousand.\nUpwards of eighty-two thousand hogsheads, therefore, must be exported\nto other countries, to France, to Holland, and to the countries which lie\nround the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas.

If we would compute in how many years the whole\nof this capital is likely to come back to Great Britain, we must add to the\ndistanceoftheAmericanreturnsthatofthereturnsfromthoseothercoun-\ntries. If,inthedirectforeigntradeofconsumptionwhichwecarryonwith\nAmerica,thewholecapitalemployedfrequentlydoesnotcomebackinless\nthan three or four years, the whole capital employed in this round-about\noneisnotlikelytocomebackinlessthanfourorfive. Iftheonecankeep\nin constant employment but a third or a fourth part of the domestic in-\ndustry which could be maintained by a capital returned once in the year,\nthe other can keep in constant employment but a fourth or fifth part of\nthatindustry. Atsomeoftheout-portsacreditiscommonlygiventothose\nforeign correspondents to whom they export their tobacco. At the port of\nLondon, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh\nand pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole\nround-abouttradearemoredistantthanthereturnsfromAmericabythe\ntime only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, how-\never, they may sometimes lie long enough. But had not the colonies been\nconfined to the market of Great Britain for the sale of their tobacco, very\nlittle more of it would probably have come to us than what was necessary\nfor the home consumption. The goods which Great Britain purchases at\npresent for her own consumption with the great surplus of tobacco which\nshe exports to other countries, she would in this case probably have pur-\nchasedwiththeimmediateproduceofherownindustry,orwithsomepart\n467", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof her own manufactures. That produce, those manufactures, instead of\nbeing almost entirely suited to one great market, as at present, would\nprobablyhavebeenfittedtoagreatnumberofsmallermarkets. Insteadof\none great round-about foreign trade of consumption, Great Britain would\nprobably have carried on a great number of small direct foreign trades of\nthe same kind. On account of the frequency of the returns, a part, and\nprobablybutasmallpart;perhapsnotaboveathirdorafourthofthecap-\nital which at present carries on this great round-about trade might have\nbeen sufficient to carry on all those small direct ones, might have kept\nin constant employment an equal quantity of British industry, and have\nequallysupportedtheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofGreatBri-\ntain. All the purposes of this trade being, in this manner, answered by a\nmuchsmallercapital,therewouldhavebeenalargesparecapitaltoapply G.ed.p604\ntootherpurposes: toimprovethelands,toincreasethemanufactures,and\ntoextendthecommerceofGreatBritain;tocomeintocompetitionatleast\nwiththeotherBritishcapitalsemployedinallthosedifferentways,tore-\nducetherateofprofitinthemall,andtherebytogivetoGreatBritain,in\nall of them, a superiority over other countries still greater than what she\natpresentenjoys.\n1333 [41] The monopoly of the colony trade, too, has forced some part of the\ncapital of Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a car-\nrying trade; and consequently, from supporting more or less the industry\nofGreatBritain,tobeemployedaltogetherinsupportingpartlythatofthe\ncoloniesandpartlythatofsomeothercountries.\n1334 [42] The goods, for example, which are annually purchased with the great\nsurplusofeighty-twothousandhogsheadsoftobaccoannuallyre-exported\nfrom Great Britain are not all consumed in Great Britain. Part of them,\nlinenfromGermanyandHolland, forexample, isreturnedtothecolonies\nfor their particular consumption. But that part of the capital of Great\nBritainwhichbuysthetobaccowithwhichthislinenisafterwardsbought\nis necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of Great Britain,\nto be employed altogether in supporting, partly that of the colonies, and\npartly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the\nproduceoftheirownindustry.\n1335 [43] Themonopolyofthecolonytradebesides,byforcingtowardsitamuch\ngreater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would natur-\nallyhavegonetoit,seemstohavebrokenaltogetherthatnaturalbalance\nwhichwouldotherwisehavetakenplaceamongallthedifferentbranches\nofBritishindustry. TheindustryofGreatBritain,insteadofbeingaccom-\nmodated to a great number of small markets, has been principally suited\ntoonegreatmarket.

A small stop in that great blood-vessel, which has\nbeenartificiallyswelledbeyonditsnaturaldimensions,andthroughwhich\nanunnaturalproportionoftheindustryandcommerceofthecountryhas\nbeen forced to circulate, is very likely to bring on the most dangerous dis- G.ed.p605\norders upon the whole body politic. The expectation of a rupture with the\ncolonies,accordingly,hasstruckthepeopleofGreatBritainwithmoreter-\nror than they ever felt for a Spanish armada, or a French invasion. It\nwas this terror, whether well or ill grounded, which rendered the repeal\nof the Stamp Act, among the merchants at least, a popular measure. In\nthe total exclusion from the colony market, was it to last only for a few\nyears, the greater part of our merchants used to fancy that they foresaw\nan entire stop to their trade; the greater part of our master manufactur-\ners,theentireruinoftheirbusiness;andthegreaterpartofourworkmen,\nan end of their employment. A rupture with any of our neighbours upon\nthe continent, though likely, too, to occasion some stop or interruption in\nthe employments of some of all these different orders of people, is fore-\nseen, however, without any such general emotion. The blood, of which\nthe circulation is stopped in some of the smaller vessels, easily disgorges\nitself into the greater without occasioning any dangerous disorder; but,\nwhen it is stopped in any of the greater vessels, convulsions, apoplexy,\nor death, are the immediate and unavoidable consequences.

First,thosecolonies,inpreparingthemselves\nfor their non-importation agreement, drained Great Britain completely\nof all the commodities which were fit for their market; secondly, the ex-\ntraordinarydemandoftheSpanishFlotahas,thisyear,drainedGermany G.ed.p607\nand the North of many commodities, linen in particular, which used to\ncomeintocompetition,evenintheBritishmarket,withthemanufactures\nof Great Britain; thirdly, the peace between Russia and Turkey has occa-\nsioned an extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which, during\nthe distress of the country, and while a Russian fleet was cruising in the\nArchipelago, had been very poorly supplied; fourthly, the demand of the\nNorth of Europe for the manufactures of Great Britain has been increas-\ningfromyeartoyearforsometimepast;andfifthly,thelatepartitionand\nconsequential pacification of Poland, by opening the market of that great\ncountry,havethisyearaddedanextraordinarydemandfromthencetothe\nincreasingdemandoftheNorth. Theseeventsareall,exceptthefourth,in\ntheir nature transitory and accidental, and the exclusion from so import-\nantabranchofthecolonytrade,ifunfortunatelyitshouldcontinuemuch\nlonger, may still occasion some degree of distress. This distress, however,\nas it will come on gradually, will be felt much less severely than if it had\ncomeonallatonce; and, inthemeantime, theindustryandcapitalofthe\ncountry may find a new employment and direction, so as to prevent this\ndistressfromeverrisingtoanyconsiderableheight.\n1338 [46] The monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, so far as it has turned to-\nwards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than\nwhat would otherwise have gone to it, has in all cases turned it, from a\nforeign trade of consumption with a neighbouring into one with a more\ndistant country; in many cases, from a direct foreign trade of consump-\ntion into a round-about one; and in some cases, from all foreign trade of\nconsumptionintoacarryingtrade. Ithasinallcases, therefore, turnedit\n470", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfrom a direction in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of\nproductivelabourintooneinwhichitcanmaintainamuchsmallerquant-\nity.

The former are always and ne-\ncessarily beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But the\nformer are so beneficial that the colony trade, though subject to a mono-\npoly,andnotwithstandingthehurtfuleffectsofthatmonopoly,isstillupon\nthewholebeneficial,andgreatlybeneficial;thoughagooddeallesssothan G.ed.p608\nitotherwisewouldbe.\n1340 [48] The effect of the colony trade in its natural and free state is to open a\ngreat, though distant, market for such parts of the produce of British in-\ndustryasmayexceedthedemandofthemarketsnearerhome,ofthoseof\nEurope, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean Sea. In\nits natural and free state, the colony trade, without drawing from those\nmarkets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them, en-\ncourages Great Britain to increase the surplus continually by continually\npresentingnewequivalentstobeexchangedforit. Initsnaturalandfree\nstate, thecolonytradetendstoincreasethequantityofproductivelabour\nin Great Britain, but without altering in any respect the direction of that\nwhichhadbeenemployedtherebefore. Inthenaturalandfreestateofthe\ncolonytrade, thecompetition ofall other nationswould hinderthe rateof\nprofit from rising above the common level either in the new market or in\nthe new employment. The new market, without drawing anything from\nthe old one, would create, if one may say so, a new produce for its own\nsupply; and that new produce would constitute a new capital for carrying\non the new employment, which in the same manner would draw nothing\nfromtheoldone.\n1341 [49] The monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the\ncompetition of other nations, and thereby raising the rate of profit both\nin the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the\nold market and capital from the old employment. To augment our share\nof the colony trade beyond what it otherwise would be is the avowed pur-\nposeofthemonopoly. Ifourshareofthattradeweretobenogreaterwith\nthan it would have been without the monopoly, there could have been no\nreason for establishing the monopoly. But whatever forces into a branch\nof trade of which the returns are slower and more distant than those of\nthe greater part of other trades, a greater proportion of the capital of any\ncountry than what of its own accord would go to that branch, necessar-\nily renders the whole quantity of productive labour annually maintained\nthere,thewholeannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthatcountry,less\nthan they otherwise would be. It keeps down the revenue of the inhabit-\n471", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nants of that country below what it would naturally rise to, and thereby\ndiminishes their power of accumulation. It not only hinders, at all times,\ntheir capital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labour\nas it would otherwise maintain, but it hinders it from increasing so fast\nas it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a still\ngreaterquantityofproductivelabour.\n1342 [50] The natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than\ncounterbalance to Great Britain the bad effects of the monopoly, so that, G.ed.p609\nmonopoly and all together, that trade, even as it carried on at present, is\nnot only advantageous, but greatly advantageous. The new market and\nthe new employment which are opened by the colony trade are of much\ngreater extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employ-\nmentwhichislostbythemonopoly. Thenewproduceandthenewcapital\nwhich has been created, if one may say so, by the colony trade, maintain\nin Great Britain a greater quantity of productive labour than what can\nhavebeenthrownoutofemploymentbytherevulsionofcapitalfromother\ntrades of which the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, how-\never, evenasitiscarriedonatpresent, isadvantageoustoGreatBritain,\nitisnotbymeansofthemonopoly,butinspiteofthemonopoly.\n1343 [51] It is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe\nthatthecolonytradeopensanewmarket. Agricultureistheproperbusi-\nness of all new colonies; a business which the cheapness of land renders\nmore advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, in the rude\nproduceofland,andinsteadofimportingitfromothercountries,theyhave\ngenerally a large surplus to export. In new colonies, agriculture either\ndrawshandsfromallotheremployments,orkeepsthemfromgoingtoany\nother employment. There are few hands to spare for the necessary, and\nnone for the ornamental manufactures. The greater part of the manufac-\nturesofbothkindstheyfinditcheapertopurchaseofothercountriesthan\nto make for themselves. It is chiefly by encouraging the manufactures of\nEurope that the colony trade indirectly encourages its agriculture. The\nmanufacturesofEurope,towhomthattradegivesemployment,constitute\na new market for the produce of the land; and the most advantageous of\nall markets, the home market for the corn and cattle, for the bread and\nbutcher\u2019s meat of Europe, is thus greatly extended by means of the trade\ntoAmerica.\n1344 [52] But that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies\nis not alone sufficient to establish, or even to maintain manufactures in\nanycountry,theexamplesofSpainandPortugalsufficientlydemonstrate.\nSpainandPortugalweremanufacturingcountriesbeforetheyhadanycon-\nsiderablecolonies. Sincetheyhadtherichestandmostfertileintheworld,\ntheyhavebothceasedtobeso.\n1345 [53] In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by\nother causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects\nof the colony trade. These causes seem to be other monopolies of differ-\n472", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nent kinds; the degradation of the value of gold and silver below what it is\nin most other countries; the exclusion from foreign markets by improper G.ed.p610\ntaxes upon exportation, and the narrowing of the home market, by still\nmoreimpropertaxesuponthetransportationofgoodsfromonepartofthe\ncountry to another; but above all, that irregular and partial administra-\ntion of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the\npursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of\nthe nation afraid to prepare goods for the consumption of those haughty\nandgreatmentowhomtheydarenotrefusetoselluponcredit, andfrom\ntheyarealtogetheruncertainofrepayment.\n1346 [54] InEngland,onthecontrary,thenaturalgoodeffectsofthecolonytrade,\nassistedbyothercauses,haveinagreatmeasureconqueredthebadeffects\nof the monopoly. These causes seem to be: the general liberty of trade,\nwhich, notwithstanding some restraints, is at least equal, perhaps super-\nior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of exporting, duty free,\nalmostallsortsofgoodswhicharetheproduceofdomesticindustrytoal-\nmostanyforeigncountry;andwhatperhapsisofstillgreaterimportance,\nthe unbounded liberty of transporting them from any one part of our own\ncountrytoanyotherwithoutbeingobligedtogiveanyaccounttoanypub-\nlic office, without being liable to question or examination of any kind; but\naboveall,thatequalandimpartialadministrationofjusticewhichrenders\nthe rights of the meanest British subject respectable to the greatest, and\nwhich, by securing to every man the fruits of his own industry, gives the\ngreatestandmosteffectualencouragementtoeverysortofindustry.\n1347 [55] If the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been advanced,\nas they certainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means of\nthe monopoly of that trade but in spite of the monopoly. The effect of the\nmonopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the quality\nand shape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to accom-\nmodate to a market, from which the returns are slow and distant, what\nwould otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the returns\nare frequent and near. Its effect has consequently been to turn a part of\nthe capital of Great Britain from an employment in which it would have\nmaintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry to one in which\nit maintains a much smaller, and thereby to diminish, instead of increas-\ning, the whole quantity of manufacturing industry maintained in Great\nBritain.\n1348 [56] Themonopolyofthecolonytrade,therefore,likealltheothermeanand\nmalignant expedients of the mercantile system, depresses the industry of\nall other countries, but chiefly that of the colonies, without in the least G.ed.p611\nincreasing, but on the contrary diminishing that of the country in whose\nfavouritisestablished.\n1349 [57] Themonopolyhindersthecapitalofthatcountry,whatevermayatany\nparticular time be the extent of that capital, from maintaining so great a\nquantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain, and from\n473", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\naffording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as it would\notherwise afford. But as capital can be increased only by savings from\nrevenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording so great a revenue\nasitwouldotherwiseafford,necessarilyhindersitfromincreasingsofast\nas it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a still\ngreaterquantityofproductivelabour,andaffordingastillgreaterrevenue\nto the industrious inhabitants of that country. One great original source\nof revenue, therefore, the wages of labour, the monopoly must necessarily\nhave rendered at all times less abundant than it otherwise would have\nbeen.\n1350 [58] By raising the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly discourages the\nimprovement of land. The profit of improvement depends upon the differ-\nence between what the land actually produces, and what, by the applica-\ntionofacertaincapital,itcanbemadetoproduce. Ifthisdifferenceaffords\nagreaterprofitthanwhatcanbedrawnfromanequalcapitalinanymer-\ncantile employment, the improvement of land will draw capital from all\nmercantileemployments. Iftheprofitisless,mercantileemploymentswill\ndraw capital from the improvement of land. Whatever, therefore, raises\ntherateofmercantileprofit,eitherlessensthesuperiorityorincreasesthe\ninferiorityoftheprofitofimprovement;andintheonecasehinderscapital\nfromgoingtoimprovement,andintheotherdrawscapitalfromit. Butby\ndiscouraging improvement, the monopoly necessarily retards the natural\nincrease of another great original source of revenue, the rent of land. By\nraising the rate of profit, too, the monopoly necessarily keeps up the mar-\nket rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be. But the price of\nland in proportion to the rent which it affords, the number of years pur-\nchasewhichiscommonlypaidforit,necessarilyfallsastherateofinterest\nrises,andrisesastherateofinterestfalls. Themonopoly,therefore,hurts\nthe interest of the landlord two different ways, by retarding the natural\nincrease,first,ofhisrent,andsecondly,ofthepricewhichhewouldgetfor\nhislandinproportiontotherentwhichitaffords.\n1351 [59] The monopoly indeed raises the rate of mercantile profit, and thereby\naugments somewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it obstructs the\nnaturalincreaseofcapital,ittendsrathertodiminishthantoincreasethe\nsumtotaloftherevenuewhichtheinhabitantsofthecountryderivefrom G.ed.p612\ntheprofitsofstock;asmallprofituponagreatcapitalgenerallyaffordinga\ngreaterrevenuethanagreatprofituponasmallone. Themonopolyraises\nthe rate of profit, but it hinders the sum of profit from rising so high as it\notherwisewoulddo.\n1352 [60] All the original sources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of\nland, and the profits of stock, the monopoly renders much less abundant\nthan they otherwise would be. To promote the little interest of one little\norderofmeninonecountry,ithurtstheinterestofallotherordersofmen\ninthatcountry,andofallmeninallothercountries.\n1353 [61] It is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit that the monopoly\n474", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\neither has proved or could prove advantageous to any one particular or-\nderofmen. Butbesidesallthebadeffectstothecountryingeneral,which\nhave already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a high rate of\nprofit, there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all these put together, but\nwhich, if we may judge from experience, is inseparably connected with it.\nThehighrateofprofitseemseverywheretodestroythatparsimonywhich\ninothercircumstancesisnaturaltothecharacterofthemerchant. When\nprofits are high that sober virtue seems to be superfluous and expensive\nluxury to suit better the affluence of his situation. But the owners of the\ngreatmercantilecapitalsarenecessarilytheleadersandconductorsofthe\nwhole industry of every nation, and their example has a much greater in-\nfluence upon the manners of the whole industrious part of it than that of\nanyotherorderofmen. Ifhisemployerisattentiveandparsimonious,the\nworkman is very likely to be so too; but if the master is dissolute and dis-\norderly, the servant who shapes his work according to the pattern which\nhis master prescribes to him will shape his life too according to the ex-\namplewhichhesetshim. Accumulationisthuspreventedinthehandsof\nallthosewhoarenaturallythemostdisposedtoaccumulate,andthefunds\ndestined for the maintenance of productive labour receive no augmenta-\ntion from the revenue of those who ought naturally to augment them the\nmost. Thecapitalofthecountry,insteadofincreasing,graduallydwindles\naway, and the quantity of productive labour maintained in it grows every\nday less and less. Have the exorbitant profits of the merchants of Cadiz\nand Lisbon augmented the capital of Spain and Portugal? Have they al-\nleviated the poverty, have they promoted the industry of those two beg-\ngarly countries? Such has been the tone of mercantile expense in those G.ed.p613\ntwo trading cities that those exorbitant profits, far from augmenting the\ngeneral capital of the country, seem scarce to have been sufficient to keep\nup the capitals upon which they were made. Foreign capitals are every\ndayintrudingthemselves,ifImaysayso,moreandmoreintothetradeof\nCadiz and Lisbon. It is to expel those foreign capitals from a trade which\ntheirowngrowseverydaymoreandmoreinsufficientforcarryingonthat\nthe Spaniards and Portuguese endeavour every day to straighten more\nand more the galling bands of their absurd monopoly. Compare the mer-\ncantile manners of Cadiz and Lisbon with those of Amsterdam, and you\nwill be sensible how differently the conduct and character of merchants\nare affected by the high and by the low profits of stock. The merchants of\nLondon, indeed, have not yet generally become such magnificent lords as\nthose of Cadiz and Lisbon, but neither are they in general such attentive\nand parsimonious burghers as those of Amsterdam. They are supposed,\nhowever, many of them, to be a good deal richer than the greater part of\nthe former, and not quite so rich as many of the latter. But the rate of\ntheir profit is commonly much lower than that of the former, and a good\ndeal higher than thatof thelatter.

The expense of the ordinary peace\nestablishment of the colonies amounted, before the commencement of the\npresentdisturbances,tothepayoftwentyregimentsoffoot;totheexpense\noftheartillery,stores,andextraordinaryprovisionswithwhichitwasne-\ncessary to supply them; and to the expense of a very considerable naval\nforcewhichwasconstantlykeptup,inordertoguard,fromthesmuggling\nvessels of other nations, the immense coast of North America, and that of\nour West Indian islands.

Ifitwasadopted,however,\nGreatBritainwouldnotonlybeimmediatelyfreedfromthewholeannual\nexpense of the peace establishment of the colonies, but might settle with\nthem such a treaty of commerce as would effectually secure to her a free\ntrade, more advantageous to the great body of the people, though less so\ntothemerchants,thanthemonopolywhichsheatpresentenjoys.

Everyprovincenecessarilycontributes,moreor G.ed.p618\nless,toincreasetheexpenseofthatgeneralgovernment. Ifanyparticular\nprovince, therefore, does not contribute its share towards defraying this\nexpense, an unequal burden must be thrown upon some other part of the\nempire. The extraordinary revenue, too, which every province affords to\nthe public in time of war, ought, from parity of reason, to bear the same\nproportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire which its or-\ndinary revenue does in time of peace. That neither the ordinary nor ex-\ntraordinary revenue which Great Britain derives from her colonies, bears\nthisproportion tothe wholerevenue ofthe Britishempire, will readilybe\nallowed. The monopoly, it has been supposed, indeed, by increasing the\n478", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nprivaterevenueofthepeopleofGreatBritain,andtherebyenablingthem\nto pay greater taxes, compensates the deficiency of the public revenue of\nthe colonies. But this monopoly, I have endeavoured to show, though a\nvery grievous tax upon the colonies, and though it may increase the rev-\nenue of a particular order of men in Great Britain, diminishes instead of\nincreasing that of the great body of the people; and consequently dimin-\nishesinsteadofincreasingtheabilityofthegreatbodyofthepeopletopay\ntaxes. The men, too, whose revenue the monopoly increases, constitute a\nparticular order, which it is both absolutely impossible to tax beyond the\nproportion of other orders, and extremely impolitic even to attempt to tax\nbeyondthatproportion,asIshallendeavourtoshowinthefollowingbook.\nNoparticularresource,therefore,canbedrawnfromthisparticularorder.\n1360 [68] The colonies may be taxed either by their own assemblies, or by the G.ed.p619\nParliamentofGreatBritain.\n1361 [69] That the colony assemblies can ever be so managed as to levy upon\ntheir constituents a public revenue sufficient not only to maintain at all\ntimes their own civil and military establishment, but to pay their proper\nproportionoftheexpenseofthegeneralgovernmentoftheBritishempire\nseemsnotveryprobable.

It was only by distributing among\nthe particular Members of Parliament a great part either of the offices,\nor of the disposal of the offices arising from this civil and military estab-\nlishment, that such a system of management could be established even\nwith regard to the Parliament of England. But the distance of the colony\nassemblies from the eye of the sovereign, their number, their dispersed\nsituation, and their various constitutions, would render it very difficult\nto manage them in the same manner, even though the sovereign had the\nsame means of doing it; and those means are wanting.

The\n479", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncare of that defence and support is not entrusted to them. It is not their\nbusiness, and they have no regular means of information concerning it.\nThe assembly of a province, like the vestry of a parish, may judge very\nproperlyconcerningtheaffairsofitsownparticulardistrict;butcanhave\nno proper means of judging concerning those of the whole empire.

What\nconcerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the as-\nsembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire;\nandtheprovincialaffairsofeachcolonymightstillberegulatedbyitsown\nassembly. Though the colonies should in this case have no representat-\nives in the British Parliament, yet, if we may judge by experience, there\nis no probability that the Parliamentary requisition would be unreason-\nable. The Parliament of England has not upon any occasion shown the\nsmallestdispositiontooverburdenthosepartsoftheempirewhicharenot\nrepresented in Parliament. The islands of Guernsey and Jersey, without\nanymeansofresistingtheauthorityofParliament,aremorelightlytaxed\nthan any part of Great Britain. Parliament in attempting to exercise its\nsupposed right, whether well or ill grounded, of taxing the colonies, has\nnever hitherto demanded of them anything which even approached to a\njust proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home. If the\ncontributionofthecolonies,besides,wastoriseorfallinproportiontothe\nrise or fall of the land tax, Parliament could not tax them without taxing\natthesametimeitsownconstituents, andthecoloniesmightinthiscase\nbeconsideredasvirtuallyrepresentedinParliament.\n1364 [72] Examples are not wanting of empires in which all the different\nprovinces are not taxed, if I may be allowed the expression, in one mass;\nbut in which the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought\nto pay, and in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper;\nwhile in others, he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective\nstates of each province shall determine. In some provinces of France, the\nkingnotonlyimposeswhattaxeshethinksproper,butassessesandlevies\ntheminthewayhethinksproper.

The whole burden of the debt contrac-\ntedonaccountofthewarwouldinthismannerfall,asitalwayshasdone\nhitherto, upon Great Britain; upon a part of the empire, and not upon\nthe whole empire.

They have rejected, there-\nfore, the proposal of being taxed by Parliamentary requisition, and like\nother ambitious and high-spirited men, have rather chosen to draw the\nswordindefenceoftheirownimportance.\n1367 [75] TowardsthedeclensionoftheRomanrepublic,thealliesofRome,who\nhad borne the principal burden of defending the state and extending the\nempire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens.\nUpon being refused, the social war broke out. During the course of that\nwar,Romegrantedthoseprivilegestothegreaterpartofthemonebyone,\nand in proportion as they detached themselves from the general confed-\neracy.

Unless this or some other method is fallen upon,\nand there seems to be none more obvious than this, of preserving the im-\nportance and of gratifying the ambition of the leading men of America, it\nis not very probable that they will ever voluntarily submit to us; and we\nought to consider that the blood which must be shed in forcing them to\n482", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndo so is, every drop of it, blood either of those who are, or of those whom\nwe wish to have for our fellow citizens.

How obstinately the city of Paris upon that occasion\ndefended itself, what a dreadful famine it supported rather than submit\nto the best and afterwards to the most beloved of all the French kings, is\nwell known. The greater part of the citizens, or those who governed the\ngreater part of them, fought in defence of their own importance, which\ntheyforesawwastobeatanendwhenevertheancientgovernmentshould\nbere-established. Ourcolonies,unlesstheycanbeinducedtoconsenttoa\nunion, are very likely to defend themselves against the best of all mother\ncountries as obstinately as the city of Paris did against one of the best of\nkings.\n1369 [77] The idea of representation was unknown in ancient times. When the\npeople of one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in another,\nthey had no other means of exercising that right but by coming in a body\ntovoteanddeliberatewiththepeopleofthatotherstate. Theadmissionof\nthe greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the privileges of Roman cit-\nizens completely ruined the Roman republic.

But\nthough America were to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parlia-\nment, the doorkeeper of the House of Commons could not find any great\ndifficulty in distinguishing between who was and who was not a member.\nThough the Roman constitution, therefore, was necessarily ruined by the\nunion of Rome with the allied states of Italy, there is not the least prob-\nability that the British constitution would be hurt by the union of Great\nBritain with her colonies.

It is the object of that\nsystem to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactures than\nby the improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the industry of the\ntownsthanbythatofthecountry. But,inconsequenceofthosediscoveries,\nthe commercial towns of Europe, instead of being the manufacturers and\ncarriers for but a very small part of the world (that part of Europe which\nis washed by the Atlantic Ocean, and the countries which lie round the\nBaltic and Mediterranean seas), have now become the manufacturers for\nthenumerousandthrivingcultivatorsofAmerica,andthecarriers,andin\nsome respects the manufacturers too, for almost all the different nations\nof Asia, Africa, and America.

He\ntherebysaveshimselfthetrouble,risk,andexpenseofexportation,andhe\nwill upon that account be glad to sell them at home, not only for a much\nsmaller price, but with somewhat a smaller profit than he might expect\nto make by sending them abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours as\nmuchashecantoturnhiscarryingtradeintoaforeigntradeofconsump-\ntion. If his stock, again, is employed in a foreign trade of consumption,\nhe will, for the same reason, be glad to dispose of at home as great a part\nas he can of the home goods, which he collects in order to export to some\nforeignmarket,andhewillthusendeavour,asmuchashecan,toturnhis\nforeign trade of consumption into a home trade.

This superiority of profit, however, is a proof that,\nin the actual circumstances of the society, those distant employments are\nsomewhatunderstockedinproportiontootheremployments,andthatthe\nstock of the society is not distributed in the properest manner among all\nthe different employments carried on in it. It is a proof that something is\neither bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be, and that some\nparticularclassofcitizensismoreorlessoppressedeitherbypayingmore\nor by getting less than what is suitable to that equality which ought to\ntake place, and which naturally does take place among all the different\nclasses of them. Though the same capital never will maintain the same\nquantity of productive labour in a distant as in a near employment, yet\na distant employment may be as necessary for the welfare of the society\nas a near one; the goods which the distant employment deals in being ne- G.ed.p630\ncessary, perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if\nthe profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level,\nthose goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be, or somewhat above\ntheirnaturalprice, andallthoseengagedintheneareremploymentswill\nbe more or less oppressed by this high price. Their interest, therefore, in\nthiscaserequiresthatsomestockshouldbewithdrawnfromthosenearer\nemployments, and turned towards that distant one, in order to reduce its\nprofitstotheirproperlevel,andthepriceofthegoodswhichitdealsinto\ntheirnaturalprice. Inthisextraordinarycase,thepublicinterestrequires\nthat some stock should be withdrawn from those employments which in\nordinary cases are more advantageous, and turned towards one which in\nordinary cases is less advantageous to the public; and in this extraordin-\nary case the natural interests and inclinations of men coincide as exactly\nwith the public interest as in all other ordinary cases, and lead them to\nwithdraw stock from the near, and to turn it towards the distant employ-\nment.\n1380 [88] It is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals nat-\nurally dispose them to turn their stocks towards the employments which\nin ordinary cases are most advantageous to the society. But if from this\nnatural preference they should turn too much of it towards those employ-\nments,thefallofprofitinthemandtheriseofitinallothersimmediately\ndispose them to alter this faulty distribution.

But those which concern the trade to America and the East Indies\n488", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nderange it perhaps more than any other, because the trade to those two\ngreat continents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other\nbranches of trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement\nis effected in those two different branches of trade are not altogether the\nsame. Monopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different sort of\nmonopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, seems to be the sole\nengineofthemercantilesystem.\n1382 [90] In the trade to America every nation endeavours to engross as much G.ed.p631\nas possible the whole market of its own colonies by fairly excluding all\nother nations from any direct trade to them.

All near employ-\nments being completely filled up, all the capital which can be placed in\nthem with any tolerable profit being already placed in them, the capital\nof Holland necessarily flows towards the most distant employments. The\ntrade to the East Indies, if it were altogether free, would probably absorb\nthe greater part of this redundant capital. The East Indies offer a mar-\nket for the manufactures of Europe and for the gold and silver as well as\nfor several other productions of Americagreater andmore extensivethan\nbothEuropeandAmericaputtogether.\n1389 [97] Every derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily\nhurtful to the society in which it takes place; whether it be by repelling\nfrom a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to it, or by\nattractingtowardsaparticulartradethatwhichwouldnototherwisecome\nto it.

Thisargu-\nment, however, if it proved anything at all, would prove that no one great\nbranch of trade could be carried on without an exclusive company, which\nis contrary to the experience of all nations.

Some of its merchants will find it for their interest to reside\nin the East Indies, and to employ their capitals there in providing goods\nfor the ships which are to be sent out by other merchants who reside in\nEurope. ThesettlementswhichdifferentEuropeannationshaveobtained\nin the East Indies, if they were taken from the exclusive companies to\nwhich they at present belong and put under the immediate protection of\nthe sovereign, would render this residence both safe and easy, at least to\nthemerchantsoftheparticularnationstowhomthosesettlementsbelong.\nIf at any particular time that part of the capital of any country which of\n491", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nits own accord tended and inclined, if I may say so, towards the East In-\ndiatrade,wasnotsufficientforcarryingonallthosedifferentbranchesof\nit, it would be a proof that, at that particular time, that country was not\nripe for that trade, and that it would do better to buy for some time, even\nat a higher price, from other European nations, the East India goods it\nhad occasion for, than to import them itself directly from the East Indies.\nWhat it might lose by the high price of those goods could seldom be equal\ntothelosswhichitwouldsustainbythedistractionofalargeportionofits\ncapital from other employments more necessary, or more useful, or more\nsuitabletoitscircumstancesandsituation,thanadirecttradetotheEast\nIndies.\n1392 [100] Though the Europeans possess many considerable settlements both\nupon the coast of Africa and in the East Indies, they have not yet estab-\nlishedineitherofthosecountriessuchnumerousandthrivingcoloniesas\nthose in the islands and continent of America. Africa, however, as well\nas several of the countries comprehended under the general name of the\nEast Indies, are inhabited by barbarous nations.

In Africa and the East Indies, therefore,\nit was more difficult to displace the natives, and to extend the European\nplantations over the greater part of the lands of the original inhabitants.\nThegeniusofexclusivecompanies,besides,isunfavourable,ithasalready\nbeen observed, to the growth of new colonies, and has probably been the G.ed.p635\nprincipal cause of the little progress which they have made in the East\nIndies. The Portuguese carried on the trade both to Africa and the East\nIndies without any exclusive companies, and their settlements at Congo,\nAngola,andBenguelaonthecoastofAfrica,andatGoaintheEastIndies,\nthoughmuchdepressedbysuperstitionandeverysortofbadgovernment,\nyetbearsomefaintresemblancetothecoloniesofAmerica,andarepartly\ninhabitedbyPortuguesewhohavebeenestablishedthereforseveralgen-\nerations.

The supplying of those ships with every sort of fresh provisions,\n492", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwith fruit and sometimes with wine, affords alone a very extensive mar-\nket for the surplus produce of the colonists. What the Cape of Good Hope\nis between Europe and every part of the East Indies, Batavia is between\nthe principal countries of the East Indies. It lies upon the most frequen-\nted road from Indostan to China and Japan, and is nearly about midway\nupon that road. Almost all the ships, too, that sail between Europe and\nChina touch at Batavia; and it is, over and above all this, the centre and\nprincipal mart of what is called the country trade of the East Indies, not\nonly of that part of it which is carried on by Europeans, but of that which\nis carried on by the native Indians; and vessels navigated by the inhab-\nitants of China and Japan, of Tonquin, Malacca, Cochin China, and the\nislandofCelebes,arefrequentlytobeseeninitsport. Suchadvantageous\nsituations have enabled those two colonies to surmount all the obstacles\nwhich the oppressive genius of an exclusive company may have occasion-\nallyopposedtotheirgrowth.

In the course of a century or two, the policy of the Eng- G.ed.p637\nlish company would in this manner have probably proved as completely\ndestructiveasthatoftheDutch.\n1394 [102] Nothing, however, can be more directly contrary to the real interest of\nthosecompanies,consideredasthesovereignsofthecountrieswhichthey\nhave conquered, than this destructive plan. In almost all countries the\nrevenueofthesovereignisdrawnfromthatofthepeople.

The quantity will always be suited with more or less ex-\nactness to the consumption of those who can afford to pay for it, and the\nprice which they will pay will always be in proportion to the eagerness of\ntheir competition. It isthe interestof sucha sovereign, therefore, toopen\nthemostextensivemarketfortheproduceofhiscountry,toallowthemost\nperfect freedom of commerce, in order to increase as much as possible the\nnumber and the competition of buyers; and upon this account to abolish,\nnot only all monopolies, but all restraints upon the transportation of the\nhomeproducefromonepartofthecountrytoanother,uponitsexportation\ntoforeigncountries,orupontheimportationofgoodsofanykindforwhich\nit can be exchanged. It is in this manner most likely to increase both the\nquantity and value of that produce, and consequently of his own share of\nit,orofhisownrevenue.\n1395 [103] But a company of merchants are, it seems, incapable of considering\nthemselves as sovereigns, even after they have become such.

Their mercantile habits draw them in this manner, al-\nmost necessarily, though perhaps insensibly, to prefer upon all ordinary\noccasionsthelittleandtransitoryprofitofthemonopolisttothegreatand\npermanent revenue of the sovereign, and would gradually lead them to\ntreat the countries subject to their government nearly as the Dutch treat\nthe Moluceas. It is the interest of the East India Company, considered\nas sovereigns, that the European goods which are carried to their Indian\ndominions should be sold there as cheap as possible; and that the Indian\ngoods which are brought from thence should bring there as good a price,\norshouldbesoldthereasdearaspossible.

That adminis-\ntration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants, a profession no\ndoubtextremelyrespectable, butwhichinnocountryintheworldcarries\nalong with it that sort of authority which naturally overawes the people,\nand without force commands their willing obedience.

The regulations accordingly which\nhave been sent out from Europe, though they have been frequently weak,\nhave upon most occasions been well-meaning. More intelligence and per-\nhaps less good-meaning has sometimes appeared in those established by\nthe servants in India. It is a very singular government in which every\nmember of the administration wishes to get out of the country, and con-\nsequently to have done with the government as soon as he can, and to\nwhose interest, the day after he has left it and carried his whole fortune\nwith him, it is perfectly indifferent though the whole country was swal-\nlowedupbyanearthquake.\n1399 [107] Imeannot,however,byanythingwhichIhaveheresaid,tothrowany G.ed.p641\nodious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the East\nIndia Company, and much less upon that of any particular persons.

I do not observe, at least in our\nStatute Book, any encouragement given to the importation of the instru-\nments of trade. When manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of\ngreatness, the fabrication of the instruments of trade becomes itself the\nobject of a great number of very important manufactures. To give any\nparticular encouragement to the importation of such instruments would\ninterfere too much with the interest of those manufactures. Such import-\nation, therefore, instead of being encouraged, has frequently been prohib-\nited. Thus the importation of wool cards, except from Ireland, or when\nbrought in as wreck or prize goods, was prohibited by the 3rd of Edward\nIV;whichprohibitionwasrenewedbythe39thofElizabeth,andhasbeen\ncontinuedandrenderedperpetualbysubsequentlaws.\n1402 [2] The importation of the materials of manufacture has sometimes been\nencouragedbyanexemptionfromthedutiestowhichothergoodsaresub-\nject,andsometimesbybounties.\n1403 [3] The importation of sheep\u2019s wool from several different countries, of\ncottonwoolfromallcountries,ofundressedflax,ofthegreaterpartofdye- G.ed.p643\ningdrugs, ofthegreaterpartofundressedhidesfromIrelandortheBrit-\nishcolonies,ofsealskinsfromtheBritishGreenlandfishery,ofpigandbar", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nironfromtheBritishcolonies,aswellasofseveralothermaterialsofman-\nufacture,hasbeenencouragedbyanexemptionfromallduties,ifproperly\nentered at the custom house.

The interest of our American colonies was re-\ngarded as the same with that of the mother country. Their wealth was\nconsidered as our wealth.

They have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers by\nanabsoluteprohibitionofimportingwoollenclothsfromanyforeigncoun-\ntry, but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the sheep\nfarmers and growers of wool by a similar prohibition of the exportation of\nlive sheep and wool. The severity of many of the laws which have been\nenacted for the security of the revenue is very justly complained of, as\nimposing heavy penalties upon actions which, antecedent to the statutes\nthat declared them to be crimes, had always been understood to be inno- G.ed.p648\ncent. But the cruellest of our revenue laws, I will venture to affirm, are\nmild and gentle in comparison of some of those which the clamour of our\nmerchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature for the\nsupport of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies. Like the laws of\nDraco,theselawsmaybesaidtobeallwritteninblood.\n1418 [18] By the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3, the exporter of sheep, lambs, or rams\nwas for the first offence to forfeit all his goods for ever, to suffer a year\u2019s\nimprisonment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market town\nupon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the second offence to be\nadjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly. To prevent the breed of\nour sheep from being propagated in foreign countries seems to have been\nthe object of this law. By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 18, the\nexportation of wool was made felony, and the exporter subjected to the\nsamepenaltiesandforfeituresasafelon.\n1419 [19] For the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that neither\nofthesestatuteswereeverexecuted.

It cannot be loaden on\nany horse or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coast, but\nbetween sun-rising and sun-setting, on pain of forfeiting the same, the\nhorses and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the sea-coast, out of\nor through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits twenty pounds, G.ed.p650\nif the wool is under the value of ten pounds; and if of greater value, then\ntreblethatvalue,togetherwithtreblecosts,tobesuedforwithintheyear.\nTheexecutiontobeagainstanytwooftheinhabitants,whomthesessions\n503", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmustreimburse,byanassessmentontheotherinhabitants,asinthecases\nof robbery.

Theseregulationstakeplacethroughthewholekingdom.\n[22] But in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex, the restrictions are\n1422\nstill more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the sea-\ncoast must given an account in writing, three days after shearing to the\nnext officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of the places\nwhere they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them he must\ngive the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of the\nname and abode of the person to whom they are sold, and of the place\nto which it is intended they should be carried. No person within fifteen\nmiles of the sea, in the said counties, can buy any wool before he enters\ninto bond to the king that no part of the wool which he shall so buy shall\nbe sold by him to any other person within fifteen miles of the sea. If any\nwool is found carrying towards the sea-side in the said counties, unless it\nhas been entered and security given as aforesaid, it is forfeited, and the\noffenderalsoforfeitsthreeshillingsforeverypoundweight. Ifanyperson\nlays any wool not entered as aforesaid within fifteen miles of the sea, it\nmust be seized and forfeited; and if, after such seizure, any person claim\nthe same, he must give security to the Exchequer that if he is cast upon\ntrialheshallpaytreblecosts,besidesallotherpenalties.\n1423 [23] Whensuchrestrictionsareimposedupontheinlandtrade,thecoasting\ntrade, we may believe, cannot be left very free.

Thegrowingofwoolisnotthechiefpurpose\nforwhichthesheepfarmeremployshisindustryandstock. Heexpectshis\nprofit not so much from the price of the fleece as from that of the carcass;\nand the average or ordinary price of the latter must even, in many cases,\nmakeuptohimwhateverdeficiencytheremaybeintheaverageorordin-\nary price of the former. It has been observed in the foregoing part of this\nwork that, \u2018Whatever regulations tend to sink the price, either of wool or\n505", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nofrawhides, belowwhatitnaturallywouldbe, must, inanimprovedand\ncultivatedcountry,havesometendencytoraisethepriceofbutcher\u2019smeat.\nThepricebothofthegreatandsmallcattlewhicharefedonimprovedand\ncultivatedlandmust besufficientto paytherent which thelandlord, and\nthe profit which the farmer has reason to expect from improved and cul-\ntivatedland.

The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid\nfortheother. Inwhatmannerthispriceistobedivideduponthedifferent\nparts of the beast is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it\nisallpaidtothem. Inanimprovedandcultivatedcountry,therefore,their\ninterest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such regu- G.ed.p653\nlations, though their interest as consumers may by the rise in the price\nof provisions.\u2019 According to this reasoning, therefore, this degradation in\nthe price of wool is not likely, in an improved and cultivated country, to\noccasion any diminution in the annual produce of that commodity, except\nso far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may somewhat diminish the\ndemandfor, andconsequentlytheproductionof, thatparticularspeciesof\nbutcher\u2019s meat. Its effect, however, even in this way, it is probable, is not\nveryconsiderable.\n1427 [27] Butthoughitseffectuponthequantityoftheannualproducemaynot\nhavebeenveryconsiderable,itseffectuponthequality,itmayperhapsbe\nthought, must necessarily have been very great.

Notwithstandingthedegradation\nof price, English wool is said to have been improved considerably during\nthe course even of the present century. The improvement might perhaps\nhave been greater if the price had been better; but the lowness of price,\nthoughitmayhaveobstructed,yetcertainlyithasnotaltogetherpreven-\ntedthatimprovement.\n1428 [28] The violence of these regulations, therefore, seems to have affected\nneitherthequantitynorthequalityoftheannualproduceofwoolsomuch\nas it might have been expected to do (though I think it probable that it\nmay have affected the latter a good deal more than the former); and the\n506", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ninterestofthegrowersofwool,thoughitmusthavebeenhurtinsomede-\ngree, seems, upon the whole, to have been much less hurt than could well\nhavebeenimagined.\n1429 [29] Theseconsiderations,however,willnotjustifytheabsoluteprohibition\nof the exportation of wool. But they will fully justify the imposition of a\nconsiderabletaxuponthatexportation.\n1430 [30] To hurt in any degree the interest of any one order of citizens, for no G.ed.p654\nother purpose but to promote that of some other, is evidently contrary to\nthat justice and equality of treatment which the sovereign owes to all the\ndifferent orders of his subjects. But the prohibition certainly hurts, in\nsome degree, the interest of the growers of wool, for no other purpose but\ntopromotethatofthemanufacturers.\n1431 [31] Every different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support\nof the sovereign or commonwealth. A tax of five, or even of ten shillings\nupon the exportation of every ton of wool would produce a very consider-\nable revenue to the sovereign. It would hurt the interest of the growers\nsomewhat less than the prohibition, because it would not probably lower\nthe price of wool quite so much. It would afford a sufficient advantage to\nthe manufacturer, because, though he might not buy his wool altogether\nso cheap as under the prohibition, he would still buy it, at least, five or\nten shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it, besides\nsavingthefreightandinsurance,whichtheotherwouldbeobligedtopay.\nIt is scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce any considerable\nrevenuetothesovereign,andatthesametimeoccasionsolittleinconveni-\nencytoanybody.\n1432 [32] Theprohibition,notwithstandingallthepenaltieswhichguardit,does\nnot prevent the exportation of wool. It is exported, it is well known, in\ngreat quantities. The great difference between the price in the home and\nthat in the foreign market presents such a temptation to smuggling that\nall the rigour of the law cannot prevent it. This illegal exportation is ad-\nvantageous to nobody but the smuggler. A legal exportation subject to a\ntax, by affording a revenue to the sovereign, and thereby saving the im-\npositionofsomeother,perhaps,moreburdensomeandinconvenienttaxes\nmightproveadvantageoustoallthedifferentsubjectsofthestate.\n1433 [33] The exportation of fuller\u2019s earth or fuller\u2019s clay, supposed to be ne-\ncessary for preparing and cleansing the woolen manufactures, has been\nsubjected to nearly the same penalties as the exportation of wool. Even\ntobacco-pipe clay, though acknowledged to be different from fuller\u2019s clay,\nyet,onaccountoftheirresemblance,andbecausefuller\u2019sclaymightsome-\ntimes be exported as tobacco-pipe clay, has been laid under the same pro-\nhibitionsandpenalties.\n1434 [34] By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 7, the exportation, not only\nof raw hides, but of tanned leather, except in the shape of boots, shoes, or\nslippers, was prohibited; and the law gave a monopoly to our bootmakers G.ed.p655\nand shoemakers, not only against our graziers, but against our tanners.\n507", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nBy subsequent statutes our tanners have got themselves exempted from\nthismonopolyuponpayingasmalltaxofonlyoneshillingonthehundred-\nweightoftannedleather,weighingonehundredandtwelvepounds.

The home market was\natalltimeslikelytobemorescantilysupplied;thecommoditieswereatall\ntimes likely to be somewhat dearer there than they would have been had\ntheexportationbeenrenderedasfreeastheimportation.\n1440 [40] By the above-mentioned statute, gum senega, or gum arabic, being\namong the enumerated dyeing drugs, might be imported duty free. They\nweresubjected,indeed,toasmallpoundageduty,amountingonlytothree-\npence in the hundredweight upon their re-exportation. France enjoyed,\nat that time, an exclusive trade to the country most productive of those\ndrugs, that which lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal; and the Brit-\nish market could not easily be supplied by the immediate importation of\nthem from the place of growth. By the 25th George II, therefore, gum\nsenega was allowed to be imported (contrary to the general dispositions\nof the Act of Navigation) from any part of Europe. As the law, however,\ndid not mean to encourage this species of trade, so contrary to the gen-\neral principles of the mercantile policy of England, it imposed a duty of\nten shillings the hundredweight upon such importation, and no part of\nthisduty wasto beafterwards drawnbackupon itsexportation. Thesuc-\ncessful war which began in 1755 gave Great Britain the same exclusive\ntrade to those countries which France had enjoyed before. Our manufac-\nturers, as soon as the peace was made, endeavoured to avail themselves\nof this advantage, and to establish a monopoly in their own favour both\nagainst the growers and against the importers of this commodity. By the\n5th Geo. III, therefore, chap. 37, the exportation of gum senega from his\nMajesty\u2019sdominionsinAfricawasconfinedtoGreatBritain,andwassub-\njected to all the same restrictions, regulations, forfeitures, and penalties\n509", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nas that of the enumerated commodities of the British colonies in America\nandtheWestIndies.

Theiravidity,however,uponthis,aswellasuponmanyother\noccasions, disappointed itself of its object. This enormous duty presented\nsuch a temptation to smuggling that great quantities of this commodity\nwere clandestinely exported, probably to all the manufacturing countries\nof Europe, put particularly to Holland, not only from Great Britain but\nfrom Africa. Upon this account, by the 14th Geo. III. chap. 10, this duty\nuponexportationwasreducedtofiveshillingsthehundredweight.\n[41] In the book of rates, according to which the Old Subsidy was levied,\n1441\nbeaver skins were estimated at six shillings and eightpence a piece, and\nthe different subsidies and imposts, which before the year 1722 had been\nlaid upon their importation, amounted to one-fifth part of the rate, or to\nsixteenpence upon each skin; all of which, except half the Old Subsidy,\namountingonlytotwopence,wasdrawnbackuponexportation. Thisduty\nupontheimportationofsoimportantamaterialofmanufacturehadbeen\nthought too high, and in the year 1722 the rate was reduced to two shil-\nlings and sixpence, which reduced the duty upon importation to sixpence,\nand of this only one half was to be drawn back upon exportation. The\nsame successful war put the country most productive of beaver under the\ndominionofGreatBritain,andbeaverskinsbeingamongtheenumerated\ncommodities, their exportation from America was consequently confined\ntothemarketofGreatBritain. Ourmanufacturerssoonbethoughtthem-\nselves of the advantage which they might make of this circumstance, and\nintheyear1764thedutyupontheimportationofbeaver-skinwasreduced\ntoonepenny,butthedutyuponexportationwasraisedtosevenpenceeach\nskin, without any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the same\nlaw,adutyofeighteenpencethepoundwasimposedupontheexportation\nof beaverwool or wombs, without making any alteration in the duty upon\nthe importation of that commodity, which, when imported by Britain and\ninBritishshipping,amountedatthattimetobetweenfourpenceandfive-\npencethepiece.\n[42] Coals may be considered both as a material of manufacture and as an\n1442\ninstrument of trade.

Thus by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 20, sect. 8, the\nexportationofframesorenginesforknittingglovesorstockingsisprohib-\nitedunderthepenalty,notonlyoftheforfeitureofsuchframesorengines\nso exported, or attempted to be exported, but of forty pounds, one half to\nthe king, the other to the person who shall inform or sue for the same. In\nthesamemanner,bythe14thGeo.III.chap.71,theexportationtoforeign\nparts of any utensils made use of in the cotton, linen, woollen, and silk\nmanufacturesisprohibitedunderthepenalty, notonlyoftheforfeitureof\nsuch utensils, but of two hundred pounds, to be paid by the person who\nshalloffendinthismanner,andlikewiseoftwohundredpoundstobepaid\nby the master of the ship who shall knowingly suffer such utensils to be\nloadedonboardhisship.\n[44] When such heavy penalties were imposed upon the exportation of the\n1444\ndead instruments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living\ninstrument, theartificer, should beallowedtogofree. Accordingly, bythe\n5th Geo. I. chap. 27, the person who shall be convicted of enticing any\nartificer of, or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go into any\nforeign parts in order to practise or teach his trade, is liable for the first\noffence to be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred pounds, and to\nthree months\u2019 imprisonment, and until the fine shall be paid; and for the\nsecond offence, to be fined in any sum at the discretion of the court, and\nto imprisonment for twelve months, and until the fine shall be paid. By\nthe 23rd Geo.

I shall endeavour to explain, however, as distinctly as I can, the\ngreatoutlinesofthisveryingenioussystem.\n1457 [3] Mr. Colbert, the famous minister of Louis XIV, was a man of probity,\nof great industry and knowledge of detail, of great experience and acute-\nnessintheexaminationofpublicaccounts,andofabilities,inshort,every\nway fitted for introducing method and good order into the collection and\nexpenditure of the public revenue.

The industry and commerce of a great country he endeavoured to\nregulate upon the same model as the departments of a public office; and\ninstead of allowing every man to pursue his own interest in his own way,\nupon the liberal plan of equality, liberty, and justice, he bestowed upon\ncertainbranchesofindustryextraordinaryprivileges,whilehelaidothers\nunder as extraordinary restraints. He was not only disposed, like other", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nEuropean ministers, to encourage more the industry of the towns than\nthat of the country; but, in order to support the industry of the towns, he\nwas willing even to depress and keep down that of the country. In order\ntorenderprovisionscheaptotheinhabitantsofthetowns,andtherebyto\nencourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he prohibited altogether\nthe exportation of corn, and thus excluded the inhabitants of the country\nfrom every foreign market for by far the most important part of the pro-\nduce of their industry. This prohibition, joined to the restraints imposed\nby the ancient provincial laws of France upon the transportation of corn\nfrom one province to another, and to the arbitrary and degrading taxes\nwhich are levied upon the cultivators in almost all the provinces, discour-\naged and kept down the agriculture of that country very much below the\nstate to which it would naturally have risen in so very fertile a soil and\nsoveryhappyaclimate. Thisstateofdiscouragementanddepressionwas\nfeltmoreorlessineverydifferentpartofthecountry,andmanydifferent\ninquiriesweresetonfootconcerningthecausesofit. Oneofthosecauses\nappeared to be the preference given, by the institutions of Mr. Colbert, to\ntheindustryofthetownsabovethatofthecountry.\n1458 [4] Iftherodbebenttoomuchoneway,saystheproverb,inordertomake\nit straight you must bend it as much the other. The French philosophers,\nwho have proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole\nsource of the revenue and wealth of every country, seem to have adopted\nthisproverbialmaxim;andasintheplanofMr.Colberttheindustryofthe\ntownswascertainlyovervaluedincomparisonwiththatofthecountry;so\nintheirsystemitseemstobeascertainlyundervalued.\n1459 [5] Thedifferentordersofpeoplewhohaveeverbeensupposedtocontrib-\nute in any respect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of\nthecountry,theydivideintothreeclasses.

The third is the class of artificers, manufacturers, and\nmerchants, whom they endeavour to degrade by the humiliating appella-\ntionofthebarrenorunproductiveclass.\n1460 [6] The class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce by the ex- G.ed.p665\npense which they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the\nland, upon the buildings, drains, enclosures, and other ameliorations,\nwhich they may either make or maintain upon it, and by means of which\nthe cultivators are enabled, with the same capital, to raise a greater pro-\nduce, and consequently to pay a greater rent.

Itadds,\nindeed, greatly to the value of some particular parts of it. But the con-\nsumption which in the meantime it occasions of other parts is precisely\n517", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nequal to the value which it adds to those parts; so that the value of the\nwhole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the least augmented\nby it. The person who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles, for example,\nwill sometimes raise the value of perhaps a pennyworth of flax to thirty\npounds sterling. But though at first sight he appears thereby to multiply\nthevalueofapartoftherudeproduceaboutseventhousandandtwohun-\ndred times, he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole annual\namount of the rude produce. The working of that lace costs him perhaps\ntwo years\u2019 labour. The thirty pounds which he gets for it when it is fin-\nishedisnomorethantherepaymentofthesubsistencewhichheadvances\nto himself during the two years that he is employed about it. The value\nwhich, by every day\u2019s, month\u2019s, or year\u2019s labour, he adds to the flax does\nno more than replace the value of his own consumption during that day,\nmonth, or year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add anything to\nthevalueofthewholeannualamountoftherudeproduceoftheland: the\nportion of that produce which he is continually consuming being always\nequaltothevaluewhichheiscontinuallyproducing. Theextremepoverty G.ed.p668\nof the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive though tri-\nfling manufacture may satisfy us that the price of their work does not in\nordinary cases exceed the value of their subsistence. It is otherwise with\nthe work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of the landlord is a\nvaluewhich,inordinarycases,itiscontinuallyproducing,overandabove\nreplacing,inthemostcompletemanner,thewholeconsumption,thewhole\nexpenselaidoutupontheemploymentandmaintenancebothofthework-\nmenandoftheiremployer.\n1467 [13] Artificers, manufacturers, and merchants can augment the revenue\nand wealth of their society by parsimony only; or, as it in this system, by\nprivation, that is, by depriving themselves a part of the funds destined\nfor their own subsistence. They annually reproduce nothing but those\nfunds. Unless, therefore, they annually save some part of them, unless\nthey annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of them,\nthe revenue and wealth of their society can never be in the smallest de-\ngree augmented by means of their industry. Farmers and country labour-\ners, on the contrary, may enjoy completely the whole funds destined for\ntheirownsubsistence,andyetaugmentatthesametimetherevenueand\nwealth of their society. Over and above what is destined for their own\nsubsistence, their industry annually affords a net produce, of which the\naugmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their soci-\nety. Nations therefore which, like France or England, consist in a great\nmeasure of proprietors and cultivators can be enriched by industry and\nenjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which, like Holland and Hamburg,\narecomposedchieflyofmerchants,artificers,andmanufacturerscangrow\nrich only through parsimony and privation. As the interest of nations so\ndifferentlycircumstancedisverydifferent,soislikewisethecommonchar-\nacter of the people: in those of the former kind, liberality, frankness and\n518", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngood fellowship naturally make a part of that common character: in the\nlatter,narrowness,meanness,andaselfishdisposition,aversetoallsocial\npleasureandenjoyment.\n1468 [14] The unproductive class, that of merchants, artificers, and manufactur-\ners,ismaintainedandemployedaltogetherattheexpenseofthetwoother\nclasses, of that of proprietors, and of that of cultivators. They furnish it\nboth with the materials of its work and with the fund of its subsistence,\nwiththecornandcattlewhichitconsumeswhileitisemployedaboutthat\nwork. Theproprietorsandcultivatorsfinallypayboththewagesofallthe\nworkmenoftheunproductiveclass,andoftheprofitsofalltheiremployers.\nThose workmen and their employers are properly the servants of the pro-\nprietors and cultivators. They are only servants who work without doors,\nasmenialservantsworkwithin. Boththeoneandtheother,however,are G.ed.p669\nequallymaintainedattheexpenseofthesamemasters. Thelabourofboth\nis equally unproductive. It adds nothing to the value of the sum total of\nthe rude produce of the land. Instead of increasing the value of that sum\ntotal,itisachargeandexpensewhichmustbepaidoutofit.\n1469 [15] The unproductive class, however, is not only useful, but greatly useful\nto the other two classes. By means of the industry of merchants, arti-\nficers, and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultivators can purchase\nboththeforeigngoodsandthemanufacturedproduceoftheirowncountry\nwhich they have occasion for with the produce of a much smaller quant-\nity of their own labour than what they would be obliged to employ if they\nwere to attempt, in an awkward and unskilful manner, either to import\nthe one or to make the other for their own use. By means of the unpro-\nductive class, the cultivators are delivered from many cares which would\notherwisedistracttheirattentionfromthecultivationofland. Thesuperi-\nority of produce, which, in consequence of this undivided attention, they\nare enabled to raise, is fully sufficient to pay the whole expense which\nthe maintenance and employment of the unproductive class costs either\nthe proprietors or themselves. The industry of merchants, artificers, and\nmanufacturers,thoughinitsownnaturealtogetherunproductive,yetcon-\ntributes in this manner indirectly to increase the produce of the land. It\nincreasestheproductivepowersofproductivelabourbyleavingitatliberty\nto confine itself to its proper employment, the cultivation of land; and the\nploughgoesfrequentlytheeasierandthebetterbymeansofthelabourof\nthemanwhosebusinessismostremotefromtheplough.\n1470 [16] Itcanneverbetheinterestoftheproprietorsandcultivatorstorestrain\nor to discourage in any respect the industry of merchants, artificers, and\nmanufacturers. The greater the liberty which this unproductive class en-\njoys, the greater will be the competition in all the different trades which\ncompose it, and the cheaper will the other two classes be supplied, both\nwithforeigngoodsandwiththemanufacturedproduceoftheirowncoun-\ntry.\n1471 [17] It can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the\n519", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nother two classes. It is the surplus produce of the land, or what remains\nafterdeductingthemaintenance,first,ofthecultivators,andafterwardsof\nthe proprietors, that maintains and employs the unproductive class. The\ngreater this surplus the greater must likewise be the maintenance and\nemployment of that class. The establishment of perfect justice, of perfect\nliberty, and of perfect equality is the very simple secret which most effec-\ntuallysecuresthehighestdegreeofprosperitytoallthethreeclasses.\n1472 [18] The merchants, artificers, and manufacturers of those mercantile G.ed.p670\nstateswhich,likeHollandandHamburg,consistchieflyofthisunproduct-\niveclass,areinthesamemannermaintainedandemployedaltogetherat\ntheexpenseoftheproprietorsandcultivatorsofland. Theonlydifference\nis, that those proprietors and cultivators are, the greater part of them,\nplacedatamostinconvenientdistancefromthemerchants,artificers,and\nmanufacturers whom they supply with the materials of their work and\nthe fund of their subsistences- the inhabitants of other countries and the\nsubjectsofothergovernments.\n1473 [19] Suchmercantilestates,however,arenotonlyuseful,butgreatlyuseful\ntotheinhabitantsofthoseothercountries. Theyfillup,insomemeasure,\na very important void, and supply the place of the merchants, artificers,\nandmanufacturerswhomtheinhabitantsofthosecountriesoughttofind\nat home, but whom, from some defect in their policy, they do not find at\nhome.\n1474 [20] It can never be the interest of those landed nations, if I may call them\nso, to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states by im-\nposing high duties upon their trade or upon the commodities which they\nfurnish. Such duties, by rendering those commodities dearer, could serve\nonly to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own land, with\nwhich, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which those\ncommodities are purchased. Such duties could serve only to discourage\nthe increase of that surplus produce, and consequently the improvement\nand cultivation of their own land. The most effectual expedient, on the\ncontrary,forraisingthevalueofthatsurplusproduce,forencouragingits\nincrease, and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own\nland would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all such\nmercantilenations.\n1475 [21] This perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual expedi-\nent for supplying them, in due time, with all the artificers, manufactur-\ners, and merchants whom they wanted at home, and for filling up in the\nproperestandmostadvantageousmannerthatveryimportantvoidwhich\ntheyfeltthere.\n1476 [22] The continual increase of the surplus produce of their land would, in\ndue time, create a greater capital than what could be employed with the\nordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land; and\nthe surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment of\nartificers and manufacturers at home. But those artificers and manufac-\n520", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nturers, finding at home both the materials of their work and the fund of\ntheirsubsistence,mightimmediatelyevenwithmuchlessartandskillbe\nabletoworkascheapasthelikeartificersandmanufacturersofsuchmer-\ncantile states who had both to bring from a great distance. Even though,\nfrom want of art and skill, they might not for some time be able to work G.ed.p671\nas cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they might be able to sell their\nwork there as cheap as that of the artificers and manufacturers of such\nmercantile states, which could not be brought to that market but from\nso great a distance; and as their art and skill improved, they would soon\nbe able to sell it cheaper. The artificers and manufacturers of such mer-\ncantile states, therefore, would immediately be rivalled in the market of\nthose landed nations, and soon after undersold and jostled out of it alto-\ngether. The cheapness of the manufactures of those landed nations, in\nconsequence of the gradual improvements of art and skill, would, in due\ntime, extendtheirsalebeyondthehomemarket, andcarrythemtomany\nforeign markets, from which they would in the same manner gradually\njostleoutmanyofthemanufacturersofsuchmercantilenations.\n1477 [23] This continual increase both of the rude and manufactured produce\nof those landed nations would in due time create a greater capital than\ncould,withtheordinaryrateofprofit,beemployedeitherinagricultureor\ninmanufactures. Thesurplusofthiscapitalwouldnaturallyturnitselfto\nforeigntrade,andbeemployedinexportingtoforeigncountriessuchparts\nof the rude and manufactured produce of its own country as exceeded the\ndemandofthehomemarket.

With inferior art\nand skill in navigation, therefore, they would be able to sell that cargo as\ncheapinforeignmarketsasthemerchantsofsuchmercantilenations;and\nwith equal art and skill they would be able to sell it cheaper. They would\nsoon, therefore, rival those mercantile nations in this branch of foreign\ntrade,andinduetimewouldjostlethemoutofitaltogether.\n1478 [24] According to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the most ad-\nvantageousmethodinwhichalandednationcanraiseupartificers,manu-\nfacturers,andmerchantsofitsownistograntthemostperfectfreedomof\ntradetotheartificers,manufacturers,andmerchantsofallothernations.\nIttherebyraisesthevalueofthesurplusproduceofitsownland,ofwhich\nthecontinualincreasegraduallyestablishesafund,whichinduetimene-\ncessarilyraisesupalltheartificers,manufacturers,andmerchantswhom\nithasoccasionfor.\n1479 [25] When a landed nation, on the contrary, oppresses either by high du-\ntiesorbyprohibitionsthetradeofforeignnations, itnecessarilyhurtsits\nowninterestintwodifferentways. First,byraisingthepriceofallforeign\n521", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ngoods and of all sorts of manufactures, it necessarily sinks the real value\nof the surplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what comes to the G.ed.p672\nsame thing, with the price of which it purchases those foreign goods and\nmanufactures. Secondly, by giving a sort of monopoly of the home market\nto its own merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, it raises the rate of\nmercantile and manufacturing profit in proportion to that of agricultural\nprofit,andconsequentlyeitherdrawsfromagricultureapartofthecapital\nwhichhadbeforebeenemployedinit,orhindersfromgoingtoitapartof\nwhat would otherwise have gone to it. This policy, therefore, discourages\nagricultureintwodifferentways;first,bysinkingtherealvalueofitspro-\nduce, and thereby lowering the rate of its profit; and, secondly, by raising\nthe rate of profit in all other employments.

It\nwould depress productive labour, by encouraging too hastily that labour\nwhichisaltogetherbarrenandunproductive.\n1481 [27] In what manner, according to this system, the sum total of the annual\nproduce of the land is distributed among the three classes above men-\ntioned, and in what manner the labour of the unproductive class does no\nmorethanreplacethevalueofitsownconsumption,withoutincreasingin\nanyrespectthevalueofthatsumtotal,isrepresentedbyMr.Quesnai,the\nvery ingenious and profound author of this system, in some arithmetical\nformularies. The first of these formularies, which by way of eminence he\npeculiarlydistinguishesbythenameofthe\u0152conomicalTable,represents\nthe manner in which he supposes the distribution takes place in a state G.ed.p673\nof the most perfect liberty and therefore of the highest prosperity- in a\nstate where the annual produce is such as to afford the greatest possible\nnet produce, and where each class enjoys its proper share of the whole\nannual produce. Some subsequent formularies represent the manner in\nwhichhesupposesthisdistributionismadeindifferentstatesofrestraint\nand regulation; in which either the class of proprietors or the barren and\nunproductive class is more favoured than the class of cultivators, and in\nwhich either the one or the other encroaches more or less upon the share\n522", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwhich ought properly to belong to this productive class. Every such en-\ncroachment, every violation of that natural distribution, which the most\nperfectlibertywouldestablish,must,accordingtothissystem,necessarily\ndegrade more or less, from one year to another, the value and sum total\nof the annual produce, and must necessarily occasion a gradual declen-\nsion in the real wealth and revenue of the society; a declension of which\ntheprogressmustbequickerorslower,accordingtothedegreeofthisen-\ncroachment,accordingasthatnaturaldistributionwhichthemostperfect\nliberty would establish is more or less violated. Those subsequent formu-\nlariesrepresentthedifferentdegreesofdeclensionwhich,accordingtothis\nsystem,correspondtothedifferentdegreesinwhichthisnaturaldistribu-\ntionisviolated.\n1482 [28] Some speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of\nthe human body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of\ndiet and exercise, of which every, the smallest, violation necessarily occa-\nsionedsomedegreeofdiseaseordisorderproportionedtothedegreeofthe\nviolation.

But\nthe healthful state of the human body, it would seem, contains in itself\nsome unknown principle of preservation, capable either of preventing or\nof correcting, in many respects, the bad effects even of a very faulty regi-\nmen. Mr. Quesnai, who was himself a physician, and a very speculative\nphysician,seemstohaveentertainedanotionofthesamekindconcerning\nthe political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive and prosper\nonly under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of perfect liberty\nand perfect justice. He seems not to have considered that, in the political\nbody, the natural effort which every man is continually making to better\nhis own condition is a principle of preservation capable of preventing and\ncorrecting,inmanyrespects,thebadeffectsofapolitical\u0153conomy,insome\ndegree, both partial and oppressive. Such a political \u0153conomy, though it\nnodoubtretardsmoreorless,isnotalwayscapableofstoppingaltogether\nthe natural progress of a nation towards wealth and prosperity, and still\nless of making it go backwards. If a nation could not prosper without the\nenjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect justice, there is not in the world\na nation which could ever have prospered.

The following observations may serve to show\ntheimproprietyofthisrepresentation.\n523", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n1484 [30] First, this class, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of\nits own annual consumption, and continues, at least, the existence of the\nstock or capital which maintains and employs it. But upon this account\nalone the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to be very\nimproperly applied to it. We should not call a marriage barren or unpro-\nductivethoughitproducedonlyasonandadaughter,toreplacethefather\nandmother,andthoughitdidnotincreasethenumberofthehumanspe- G.ed.p675\ncies, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country labour-\ners,indeed,overandabovethestockwhichmaintainsandemploysthem,\nreproduce annually a net produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a mar-\nriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than one\nwhich affords only two; so the labour of farmers and country labourers is\ncertainlymoreproductivethanthatofmerchants,artificers,andmanufac-\nturers. Thesuperiorproduceoftheoneclass,however,doesnotrenderthe\notherbarrenorunproductive.\n1485 [31] Secondly, it seems, upon this account, altogether improper to consider\nartificers, manufacturers, and merchants in the same light as menial ser-\nvants. Thelabourofmenialservantsdoesnotcontinuetheexistenceofthe\nfundwhichmaintainsandemploysthem. Theirmaintenanceandemploy-\nment is altogether at the expense of their masters, and the work which\nthey perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work consists\nin services which perish generally in the very instant of their perform-\nance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity which\ncan replacethe value oftheir wages andmaintenance. The labour, on the\ncontrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants naturally does fix\nandrealizeitselfinsomesuchvendiblecommodity. Itisuponthisaccount\nthat, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and unproductive la-\nbour, I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and merchants among the\nproductivelabourers,andmenialservantsamongthebarrenorunproduct-\nive.\n1486 [32] Thirdly, it seems upon every supposition improper to say that the la-\nbour of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants does not increase the\nreal revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example, as\nitseemstobesupposedinthissystem,thatthevalueofthedaily,monthly,\nandyearlyconsumptionofthisclasswasexactlyequaltothatofitsdaily,\nmonthly,andyearlyproduction,yetitwouldnotfromthencefollowthatits\nlabour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real value of the annual\nproduce of the land and labour of the society. An artificer, for example,\nwho, in the first six months after harvest, executes ten pounds\u2019 worth of\nwork, though he should in the same time consume ten pounds\u2019 worth of\ncorn and other necessaries, yet really adds the value of ten pounds to the\nannual produce of the land and labour of the society. While he has been\nconsumingahalf-yearlyrevenueoftenpounds\u2019worthofcornandotherne-\ncessaries, he has produced an equal value of work capable of purchasing,\neither to himself or some other person, an equal half-yearly revenue. The\n524", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nvalue,therefore,ofwhathasbeenconsumedandproducedduringthesesix G.ed.p676\nmonths is equal, not to ten, but to twenty pounds. It is possible, indeed,\nthat no more than ten pounds\u2019 worth of this value may ever have existed\natanyonemomentoftime. Butifthetenpounds\u2019worthofcornandother\nnecessaties,whichwereconsumedbytheartificer,hadbeenconsumedbya\nsoldierorbyamenialservant,thevalueofthatpartoftheannualproduce\nwhich existed at the end of the six months would have been ten pounds\nlessthanitactuallyisinconsequenceofthelabouroftheartificer. Though\nthe value of what the artificer produces, therefore, should not at any one\nmoment of time be supposed greater than the value he consumes, yet at\neverymomentoftimetheactuallyexistingvalueofgoodsinthemarketis,\ninconsequenceofwhatheproduces,greaterthanitotherwisewouldbe.\n1487 [33] When the patrons of this system assert that the consumption of arti-\nficers, manufacturers, and merchants is equal to the value of what they\nproduce,theyprobablymeannomorethanthattheirrevenue,orthefund\ndestined for their consumption, is equal to it. But if they had expressed\nthemselves more accurately, and only asserted that the revenue of this\nclass was equal to the value of what they produced, it might readily have\noccurredtothereaderthatwhatwouldnaturallybesavedoutofthisrev-\nenuemustnecessarilyincreasemoreorlesstherealwealthofthesociety.\nIn order, therefore, to make out something like an argument, it was ne-\ncessary that they should express themselves as they have done; and this\nargument, even supposing things actually were as it seems to presume\nthemtobe,turnsouttobeaveryinconclusiveone.\n1488 [34] Fourthly,farmersandcountrylabourerscannomoreaugment,without\nparsimony,therealrevenue,theannualproduceofthelandandlabourof\ntheir society, than artificers, manufacturers, and merchants. The annual\nproduceofthelandandlabourofanysocietycanbeaugmentedonlyintwo\nways; either, first, by some improvement in the productive powers of the\nusefullabouractuallymaintainedwithinit;or,secondly,bysomeincrease\ninthequantityofthatlabour.\n1489 [35] The improvement in the productive powers of useful labour depend,\nfirst, upon the improvement in the ability of the workman; and, secondly,\nupon that of the machinery with which he works. But the labour of arti-\nficers and manufacturers, as it is capable of being more subdivided, and\nthe labour of each workman reduced to a greater simplicity of operation\nthan that of farmers and country labourers, so it is likewise capable of\nboth these sorts of improvements in a much higher degree1. In this re-\nspect,therefore,theclassofcultivatorscanhavenosortofadvantageover\nthatofartificersandmanufacturers.\n1490 [36] Theincreaseinthequantityofusefullabouractuallyemployedwithin G.ed.p677\nanysocietymustdependaltogetherupontheincreaseofthecapitalwhich\nemploysit;andtheincreaseofthatcapitalagainmustbeexactlyequalto\n1[Smith]SeeBookI.Chap.I.\n525", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe amount of the savings from the revenue, either of the particular per-\nsons who manage and direct the employment of that capital, or of some\nother persons who lend it to them. If merchants, artificers, and manu-\nfacturers are, as this system seems to suppose, naturally more inclined\ntoparsimonyandsavingthanproprietorsandcultivators,theyare,sofar,\nmorelikelytoaugmentthequantityofusefullabouremployedwithintheir\nsociety, andconsequentlytoincreaseitsrealrevenue, theannualproduce\nofitslandandlabour.\n1491 [37] Fifthlyandlastly,thoughtherevenueoftheinhabitantsofeverycoun-\ntry was supposed to consist altogether, as this system seems to suppose,\ninthequantityofsubsistencewhichtheirindustrycouldprocuretothem;\nyet,evenuponthissupposition,therevenueofatradingandmanufactur-\ning country must, other things being equal, always be much greater than\nthat of one without trade or manufactures.

It is thus that Holland draws a\ngreatpartofitssubsistencefromothercountries;livecattlefromHolstein\nand Jutland, and corn from almost all the different countries of Europe.\nA small quantity of manufactured produce purchases a great quantity of\nrude produce. A trading and manufacturing country, therefore, naturally\npurchaseswithasmallpartofitsmanufacturedproduceagreatpartofthe\nrude produce of other countries; while, on the contrary, a country without\ntrade and manufactures is generally obliged to purchase, at the expense\nof a great part of its rude produce, a very small part of the manufactured\nproduce of other countries.

InChinatheconditionofalabourerissaidtobeasmuchsuperior\nto that of an artificer as in most parts of Europe that of an artificer is to\nthatofalabourer. InChina,thegreatambitionofeverymanistogetpos- G.ed.p680\nsession of some little bit of land, either in property or in lease; and leases\nare there said to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be suffi-\nciently secured to the lessees.

ExceptwithJapan,theChinesecarryon,themselves,andintheirown\nbottoms, little or no foreign trade; and it is only into one or two ports of\ntheir kingdom that they even admit the ships of foreign nations.

But the great extent\nof the empire of China, the vast multitude of its inhabitants, the variety G.ed.p681\nof climate, and consequently of productions in its different provinces, and\nthe easy communication by means of water carriage between the greater\npart of them, render the home market of that country of so great extent\nastobealonesufficienttosupportverygreatmanufactures,andtoadmit\nof very considerable subdivisions of labour.

Upontheirpresentplantheyhavelittleopportunityexceptthatof\ntheJapanese.\n1496 [42] The policy of ancient Egypt too, and that of the Gentoo government of\nIndostan, seem to have favoured agriculture more than all other employ-\nments.\n1497 [43] Both in ancient Egypt and Indostan the whole body of the people was\ndivided into different castes or tribes, each of which was confined, from\nfather to son, to a particular employment or class of employments. The\nson of a priest was necessarily a priest; the son of a soldier, a soldier; the\nson of a labourer, a labourer; the son of a weaver, a weaver; the son of\na tailor, a tailor, etc. In both countries, the caste of the priests held the\nhighest rank, and that of the soldiers the next; and in both countries, the\ncasteofthefarmersandlabourerswassuperiortothecastesofmerchants\nandmanufacturers.\n1498 [44] The government of both countries was particularly attentive to the in-\nterest of agriculture. The works constructed by the ancient sovereigns of\nEgyptfortheproperdistributionofthewatersoftheNilewerefamousin\nantiquity; and the ruined remains of some of them are still the admira-\ntion of travellers. Those of the same kind which were constructed by the\nancient sovereigns of Indostan for the proper distribution of the waters of\nthe Ganges as well as of many other rivers, though they have been less G.ed.p682\ncelebrated, seem to have been equally great. Both countries, accordingly,\nthough subject occasionally to dearths, have been famous for their great\nfertility. Though both were extremely populous, yet, in years of moder-\nate plenty, they were both able to export great quantities of grain to their\nneighbours.\n1499 [45] The ancient Egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea; and as\nthe Gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor con-\nsequently to dress any victuals upon the water, it in effect prohibits them\nfrom all distant sea voyages. Both the Egyptians and Indians must have\ndepended almost altogether upon the navigation of other nations for the\nexportationoftheirsurplusproduce;andthisdependency,asitmusthave\nconfined the market, so it must have discouraged the increase of this sur-\nplus produce. It must have discouraged, too, the increase of the manufac-\ntured produce more than that of the rude produce. Manufactures require\namuchmoreextensivemarketthanthemostimportantpartsoftherude\nproduce of the land.

But in such large countries as France and Eng-\nland, the number of people employed in agriculture has by some authors\nbeen computed at a half, by others at a third, and by no author that I\nknow of, at less than a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country.

In both ancient Egypt and Indostan, indeed, the confinement of\ntheforeignmarketwasinsomemeasurecompensatedbytheconveniency\nofmanyinlandnavigations,whichopened,inthemostadvantageousman-\nner, the whole extent of the home market to every part of the produce of\nevery different district of those countries.

But the small extent of ancient\nEgypt,whichwasneverequaltoEngland,mustatalltimeshaverendered\nthehomemarketofthatcountrytoonarrowforsupportinganygreatvari- G.ed.p683\nety of manufactures. Bengal, accordingly, the province of Indostan, which\ncommonly exports the greatest quantity of rice, has always been more re-\nmarkable for the exportation of a great variety of manufactures than for\nthat of its grain. Ancient Egypt, on the contrary, though it exported some\nmanufactures, fine linen in particular, as well as some other goods, was\nalways most distinguished for its great exportation of grain. It was long\nthegranaryoftheRomanempire.\n1500 [46] The sovereigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different king-\ndomsintowhichIndostanhasatdifferenttimesbeendivided,havealways\nderived the whole, or by far the most considerable part, of their revenue\nfrom some sort of land tax or land rent. This land tax or land rent, like\nthe tithe in Europe, consisted in a certain proportion, a fifth, it is said,\nof the produce of the land, which was either delivered in kind, or paid in\nmoney, according to a certain valuation, and which therefore varied from\nyear to year according to all the variations of the produce. It was natural\ntherefore that the sovereigns of those countries should be particularly at-\ntentive to the interests of agriculture, upon the prosperity or declension\nofwhichimmediatelydependedtheyearlyincreaseordiminutionoftheir\nownrevenue.\n1501 [47] ThepolicyoftheancientrepublicsofGreece,andthatofRome,though\nit honoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade, yet\n530", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nseems rather to have discouraged the latter employments than to have\ngivenanydirectorintentionalencouragementtotheformer. Inseveralof\nthe ancient states of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited altogether; and\nin several others the employments of artificers and manufacturers were\nconsidered as hurtful to the strength and agility of the human body, as\nrendering it incapable of those habits which their military and gymnastic\nexercisesendeavouredtoforminit,andastherebydisqualifyingitmoreor\nlessforundergoingthefatiguesandencounteringthedangersofwar. Such\noccupations were considered as fit only for slaves, and the free citizens of\nthestatewereprohibitedfromexercisingthem.

Suchtrades\nwere, at Athens and Rome, all occupied by the slaves of the rich, who ex-\nercised them for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth, power, and\nprotection made it almost impossible for a poor freeman to find a mar-\nket for his work, when it came into competition with that of the slaves\nof the rich. Slaves, however, are very seldom inventive; and all the most\nimportantimprovements, eitherin machinery, or inthe arrangementand\ndistributionofworkwhichfacilitateandabridgelabour,havebeenthedis-\ncoveriesoffreemen. Shouldaslaveproposeanyimprovementofthiskind,\nhis master would be very apt to consider the proposal as the suggestion\nof laziness, and a desire to save his own labour at the master\u2019s expense.\nThepoorslave,insteadofreward,wouldprobablymeetwithmuchabuse,\nperhapswithsomepunishment. Inthemanufacturescarriedonbyslaves,\ntherefore, more labour must generally have been employed to execute the\nsame quantity of work than in those carried on by freemen. The work of\ntheformermust,uponthataccount,generallyhavebeendearerthanthat\nof the latter. The Hungarian mines, it is remarked by Mr. Montesquieu,\nthoughnotricher,havealwaysbeenwroughtwithlessexpense,andthere-\nforewithmoreprofit,thantheTurkishminesintheirneighbourhood. The\nTurkish mines are wrought by slaves; and the arms of those slaves are\nthe only machines which the Turks have ever thought of employing. The\nHungarianminesarewroughtbyfreemen,whoemployagreatdealofma-\nchinery, by which they facilitate and abridge their own labour. From the\nvery little that is known about the price of manufactures in the times of\nthe Greeks and Romans, it would appear that those of the finer sort were G.ed.p685\nexcessively dear. Silk sold for its weight in gold. It was not, indeed, in\nthose times a European manufacture; and as it was all brought from the\nEastIndies,thedistanceofthecarriagemayinsomemeasureaccountfor\nthe greatness of price. The price, however, which a lady, it is said, would\nsometimes pay for a piece of very fine linen, seems to have been equally\nextravagant; and as linen was always either a European, or at farthest,\nanEgyptianmanufacture,thishighpricecanbeaccountedforonlybythe\ngreatexpenseofthelabourwhichmusthavebeenemployedaboutit,and\n531", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe expense of this labour again could arise from nothing but the awk-\nwardnessofthemachinerywhichitmadeuseof.

When the expense of fashionable\ndress is very great, the variety must be very small. But when, by the im-\nprovements in the productive powers of manufacturing art and industry,\nthe expense of any one dress comes to be very moderate, the variety will\nnaturallybeverygreat. Therich,notbeingabletodistinguishthemselves\nby the expense of any one dress, will naturally endeavour to do so by the\nmultitudeandvarietyoftheirdresses.\n1502 [48] The greatest and most important branch of the commerce of every na-\ntion,ithasalreadybeenobserved,isthatwhichiscarriedonbetweenthe\ninhabitants of the town and those of the country. The inhabitants of the\ntown draw from the country the rude produce which constitutes both the\nmaterials of their work and the fund of their subsistence; and they pay\nfor this rude produce by sending back to the country a certain portion of\nit manufactured and prepared for immediate use. The trade which is car-\nried on between these two different sets of people consists ultimately in a\ncertainquantityofrudeproduceexchangedforacertainquantityofmanu-\nfacturedproduce.

It retards,\ninstead of accelerating, the progress of the society towards real wealth\nandgreatness;anddiminishes,insteadofincreasing,therealvalueofthe\nannualproduceofitslandandlabour.\n1505 [51] All systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus\ncompletely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\nestablishesitselfofitsownaccord.

Running,wrestling,cudgel-playing,throwingthe\njavelin, drawing the bow, etc., are the common pastimes of those who live\nin the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or\nArab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks\nwhich he carries with him in the same manner as in peace. His chief or\nsovereign, for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns, is at no sort of\nexpense in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it the chance of\nplunderistheonlypaywhichheeitherexpectsorrequires.\n1511 [5] An army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men.\nThe precarious subsistence which the chase affords could seldom allow a\ngreater number to keep together for any considerable time.

The judgment of Thucydides, that both Europe\nandAsiacouldnotresisttheScythiansunited,hasbeenverifiedbytheex-\nperienceofallages. Theinhabitantsoftheextensivebutdefencelessplains\nof Scythia or Tartary have been frequently united under the dominion of\nthechiefofsomeconqueringhordeorclan,andthehavocanddevastation\nof Asia have always signalized their union.

The hardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues\nof war, to some of which their necessary occupations bear a great ana-\nlogy. The necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the\ntrenches, and to fortify a camp as well as to enclose a field.

Allthe\nmenofthemilitaryage,however,maytakethefield,and,insmallnations\nof this kind, have frequently done so. In every nation the men of the mil-\nitary age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part of the\nwhole body of the people.

He trusts that the work\nwhich must be done in the meantime can be well enough executed by the\nold men, the women, and the children. He is not unwilling, therefore, to\nserve without pay during a short campaign, and it frequently costs the\nsovereignorcommonwealthaslittletomaintainhiminthefieldastopre-\npare him for it. The citizens of all the different states of ancient Greece\nseemto haveservedinthis mannertillafter the secondPersianwar; and\nthe people of Peloponnesus till after the Peloponnesian war. The Pelo-\nponnesians, Thucydides observes, generally left the field in the summer,\nand returned home to reap the harvest. The Roman people under their G.ed.p694\nkings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same man-\nner. ItwasnottillthesiegeofVeiithattheywhostayedathomebeganto\ncontribute something towards maintaining those who went to war. In the\nEuropean monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman\nempire, both before and for some time after the establishment of what is\nproperly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their immediate\ndependents, used to serve the crown at their own expense. In the field, in\nthe same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by their own\nrevenue,andnotbyanystipendorpaywhichtheyreceivedfromtheking\nuponthatparticularoccasion.\n538", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\n1514 [8] In a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute to\nrender it altogether impossible that they who take the field should main-\ntain themselves at theirown expense. Thosetwo causesare, theprogress\nofmanufactures,andtheimprovementintheartofwar.\n1515 [9] Though a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided\nit begins after seed-time and ends before harvest, the interruption of his\nbusiness will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his rev-\nenue. Without the intervention of his labour, nature does herself the\ngreater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that G.ed.p695\nanartificer,asmith,acarpenter,oraweaver,forexample,quitshiswork-\nhouse, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature does\nnothing for him, he does all for himself. When he takes the field, there-\nfore,indefenceofthepublic,ashehasnorevenuetomaintainhimself,he\nmust necessarily be maintained by the public. But in a country of which\na great part of the inhabitants are artificers and manufacturers, a great\npart of the people who go to war must be drawn from those classes, and\nmust therefore be maintained by the public as long as they are employed\ninitsservice.\n1516 [10] When the art of war, too, has gradually grown up to be a very intric-\nate and complicated science, when the event of war ceases to be determ-\nined,asinthefirstagesofsociety,byasingleirregularskirmishorbattle,\nbutwhenthecontestisgenerallyspunoutthroughseveraldifferentcam-\npaigns, each ofwhichlasts during thegreater partofthe year, itbecomes\nuniversallynecessarythatthepublicshouldmaintainthosewhoservethe\npublic in war, at least while they are employed in that service. Whatever\nin time of peace might be the ordinary occupation of those who go to war,\nsoverytediousandexpensiveaservicewouldotherwisebefartooheavya\nburden upon them. After the second Persian war, accordingly, the armies\nofAthensseemtohavebeengenerallycomposedofmercenarytroops,con-\nsisting, indeed, partly of citizens, but partly too of foreigners, and all of\nthemequallyhiredandpaidattheexpenseofthestate. Fromthetimeof\nthe siege of Veii, the armies of Rome received pay for their service during\nthetimewhichtheyremainedinthefield.

In a civilised society, as the soldiers are maintained\naltogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of the\nformer can never exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above\nmaintaining,inamannersuitabletotheirrespectivestations,boththem-\nselvesandtheotherofficersofgovernmentandlawwhomtheyareobliged\nto maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a fourth or G.ed.p696\na fifth part of the whole body of the people considered themselves as sol-\n539", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndiers, and would sometimes, it is said, take a field. Among the civilised\nnations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed that not more than\none-hundredth part of the inhabitants in any country can be employed as\nsoldiers without ruin to the country which pays the expenses of their ser-\nvice.\n1518 [12] The expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have be-\ncome considerable in any nation till long after that of maintaining it in\nthe field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth. In\nallthedifferentrepublicsofancientGreece,tolearnhismilitaryexercises\nwas a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free\ncitizen. Ineverycitythereseemstohavebeenapublicfield,inwhich,un-\nder the protection of the public magistrate, the young people were taught\ntheir different exercises by different masters. In this very simple institu-\ntion consisted the whole expense which any Grecian state seems ever to\nhave been at in preparing its citizens for war. In ancient Rome the ex-\nercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose with those of\nthe Gymnasium in ancient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the\nmany public ordinances that the citizens of every district should practise\narchery as well as several other military exercises were intended for pro-\nmoting the same purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well.\nEitherfromwantofinterestintheofficersentrustedwiththeexecutionof\nthoseordinances,orfromsomeothercause,theyappeartohavebeenuni-\nversally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments, military\nexercisesseemtohavegonegraduallyintodisuseamongthegreatbodyof\nthepeople.\n1519 [13] In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole period\nof their existence, and under the feudal governments for a considerable\ntime after their first establishment, the trade of a soldier was not a sep-\narate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole or principal occupation of\na particular class of citizens.

The state of the mechanical, as well as of some\nother arts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the degree\nofperfectiontowhichitiscapableofbeingcarriedatanyparticulartime.\nBut in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is necessary that\nit should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of\ncitizens, andthedivisionoflabourisasnecessaryfortheimprovementof\nthis, as of every other art. Into other arts the division of labour is natur-\nallyintroducedbytheprudenceofindividuals,whofindthattheypromote\ntheir private interest better by confining themselves to a particular trade\n540", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthan by exercising a great number. But it is the wisdom of the state only\nwhich can render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separate and\ndistinct from all others. A private citizen who, in time of profound peace,\nand without any particular encouragement from the public, should spend\nthe greater part of his time in military exercises, might, no doubt, both\nimprove himself very much in them, and amuse himself very well; but\nhe certainly would not promote his own interest. It is the wisdom of the\nstateonlywhichcanrenderitforhisinteresttogiveupthegreaterpartof\nhis time to this peculiar occupation: and states have not always had this\nwisdom,evenwhentheircircumstanceshadbecomesuchthatthepreser-\nvationoftheirexistencerequiredthattheyshouldhaveit.\n1521 [15] Ashepherdhasagreatdealofleisure;ahusbandman,intherudestate\nofhusbandry, hassome; anartificerormanufacturerhasnoneatall.

The practice of military exercises is only the occasional\noccupation of the soldiers of a militia, and they derive the principal and\nordinary fund of their subsistence from some other occupation. In a mi-\nlitia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates\nover that of the soldier; in a standing army, that of the soldier predomin-\natesovereveryothercharacter: andinthisdistinctionseemstoconsistthe\nessentialdifferencebetweenthosetwodifferentspeciesofmilitaryforce.\n1526 [20] Militias have been of several different kinds. In some countries the\ncitizensdestinedfordefendingthestatesseemtohavebeenexercisedonly,\nwithout being, if I may say so, regimented; that is, without being divided\ninto separate and distinct bodies of troops, each of which performed its\nexercisesunderitsownproperandpermanentofficers. Intherepublicsof\nancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as long as he remained at home,\nseemstohavepractisedhisexerciseseitherseparatelyandindependently,\nor with such of his equals as he liked best, and not to have been attached\nto any particular body of troops till he was actually called upon to take\nthe field. In other countries, the militia has not only been exercised, but G.ed.p699\nregimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I believe, in every other\ncountryofmodernEuropewhereanyimperfectmilitaryforceofthiskind\nhasbeenestablished,everymilitiamanis, evenintimeofpeace,attached\nto a particular body of troops, which performs its exercises under its own\nproperandpermanentofficers.\n1527 [21] Before the invention of firearms, that army was superior in which the\nsoldiershad,eachindividually,thegreatestskillanddexterityintheuseof\ntheir arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highest consequence,\nand commonly determined the state of battles. But this skill and dexter-\nity in the use of their arms could be acquired only, in the same manner\nas fencing is at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but each man\nseparately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or with his\nown particular equals and companions. Since the invention of firearms,\nstrength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity and skill in\nthe use of arms, though they are far from being of no consequence, are,\nhowever, of less consequence. The nature of the weapon, though it by no\nmeans puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful, puts him more\nnearly so than he ever was before. All the dexterity and skill, it is sup-\nposed, which are necessary for using it, can be well enough acquired by\npractisingingreatbodies.\n1528 [22] Regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command are qualities\nwhich, in modern armies, are of more importance towards determining\nthe fate of battles than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of\ntheirarms.

In an ancient battle there was no noise\nbut what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there was no\ninvisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal weapon\nactuallydidapproachhim,sawclearlythatnosuchweaponwasnearhim.\nIn these circumstances, and among troops who had some confidence in\ntheir own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it must have been\nagooddeallessdifficulttopreservesomedegreeregularityandorder,not\nonlyinthebeginning,butthroughthewholeprogressofanancientbattle,\nand till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits of reg-\nularity, order, and prompt obedience to command can be acquired only by\ntroopswhichareexercisedingreatbodies.\n1529 [23] A militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined\nor exercised, must always be much inferior to a well-disciplined and well- G.ed.p700\nexercisedstandingarmy.\n1530 [24] The soldiers who are exercised only once a week, or once a month, can\nnever be so expert in the use of their arms as those who are exercised\neveryday,oreveryotherday;andthoughthiscircumstancemaynotbeof\nsomuchconsequenceinmodernasitwasinancienttimes,yettheacknow-\nledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, it is said, very much to\ntheir superior expertness in their exercise, may satisfy us that it is, even\natthisday,ofveryconsiderableconsequence.\n1531 [25] The soldiers who are bound to obey their officer only once a week or\nonce a month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their\nown affairs their own way, without being in any respect accountable to\nhim, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can never have\nthe same disposition to ready obedience, with those whose whole life and\nconductareeverydaydirectedbyhim,andwhoeverydayevenriseandgo\ntobed,oratleastretiretotheirquarters,accordingtohisorders. Inwhat\niscalleddiscipline,orinthehabitofreadyobedience,amilitiamustalways\nbestillmoreinferiortoastandingarmythanitmaysometimesbeinwhat\nis called the manual exercise, or in the management and use of its arms.\nBut in modern war the habit of ready and instant obedience is of much\ngreater consequence than a considerable superiority in the management\nofarms.\n1532 [26] Those militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under\nthe same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace, are by\nfar the best. In respect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, G.ed.p701\nthey approach nearest to standing armies. The highland militia, when it\nservedunderitsownchieftains,hadsomeadvantageofthesamekind.

When they had acquired any booty they\nwere eager to return home, and his authority was seldom sufficient to de-\n543", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntain them. In point of obedience they were always much inferior to what\nis reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the highlanders too, from their\nstationary life, spend less of their time in the open air, they were always\nless accustomed to military exercises, and were less expert in the use of\ntheirarmsthantheTartarsandArabsaresaidtobe.\n1533 [27] A militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has served\nfor several successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every respect a\nstanding army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their\narms, and, being constantly under the command of their officers, are ha-\nbituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing\narmies. What they were before they took the field is of little importance.\nTheynecessarilybecomeineveryrespectastandingarmyaftertheyhave\npassedafewcampaignsinit. ShouldthewarinAmericadragoutthrough\nanother campaign, the American militia may become in every respect a\nmatch for that standing army of which the valour appeared, in the last\nwar, at least not inferior to that of the hardiest veterans of France and\nSpain.\n1534 [28] This distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will\nbe found, bears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well-\nregulatedstandingarmyhasoveramilitia.\n1535 [29] Oneofthefirststandingarmiesofwhichwehaveanydistinctaccount,\nin any well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His fre- G.ed.p702\nquent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of the\nGreekcitiesintheneighbourhoodofMacedon,graduallyformedhistroops,\nwhich in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact discipline of a\nstanding army. When he was at peace, which he was very seldom, and\nneverforanylongtimetogether,hewascarefulnottodisbandthatarmy.\nIt vanquished and subdued, after a long and violent struggle, indeed, the\ngallant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient\nGreece, and afterwards, with very little struggle, the effeminate and ill-\nexercisedmilitiaofthegreatPersianempire. ThefalloftheGreekrepub-\nlicsandofthePersianempirewastheeffectoftheirresistiblesuperiority\nwhich a standing army has over every sort of militia. It is the first great\nrevolution in the affairs of mankind of which history has preserved any\ndistinctorcircumstantialaccount.\n1536 [30] The fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the\nsecond. Allthevarietiesinthefortuneofthosetwofamousrepublicsmay\nverywellbeaccountedforfromthesamecause.\n1537 [31] From the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian\nwar the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed\nunder three great generals, who succeeded one another in the command:\nHamilcar, his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Hannibal; first in chas-\ntising their own rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the revolted\nnations of Africa, and, lastly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain.\nThe army which Hannibal led from Spain into Italy must necessarily, in\n544", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthosedifferentwars,havebeengraduallyformedtotheexactdisciplineof\nastandingarmy. TheRomans,inthemeantime,thoughtheyhadnotbeen\naltogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in\nanywarofverygreatconsequence,andtheirmilitarydiscipline,itisgen-\nerally said, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Hannibal\nencounteredatTrebia,Thrasymenus,andCann\u00e6weremilitiaopposedto\nastandingarmy. Thiscircumstance,itisprobable,contributedmorethan\nanyothertodeterminethefateofthosebattles.\n1538 [32] The standing army which Hannibal left behind him in Spain had the\nlike superiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it, and\nin a few years, under the command of his brother, the younger Asdrubal, G.ed.p703\nexpelledthemalmostentirelyfromthatcountry.\n1539 [33] Hannibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being con-\ntinually in the field, became in the progress of the war a well disciplined\nand well-exercised standing army, and the superiority of Hannibal grew\nevery day less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole,\nor almost the whole of the standing army which he commanded in Spain,\nto the assistance of his brother in Italy. In this march he is said to have\nbeen misled by his guides, and in a country which he did not know, was\nsurprised and attacked by another standing army, in every respect equal\norsuperiortohisown,andwasentirelydefeated.\n1540 [34] WhenAsdrubalhadleftSpain,thegreatScipiofoundnothingtooppose\nhim but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued that\nmilitia, and, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily became\na well-disciplined and well-exercised standing army. That standing army\nwas afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to\noppose it. In order to defend Carthage it became necessary to recall the\nstanding army of Hannibal. The disheartened and frequently defeated\nAfrican militiajoined it, and, at thebattle of Zama, composedthe greater\npart of the troops of Hannibal. The event of that day determined the fate\nofthetworivalrepublics.\n1541 [35] From the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the Ro-\nman republic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing armies.\nThe standing army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms. In\nthe height of their grandeur it cost them two great wars, and three great\nbattles, to subdue that little kingdom, of which the conquest would prob-\nably have been still more difficult had it not been for the cowardice of its\nlast king. The militias of all the civilised nations of the ancient world, of\nGreece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble resistance to the stand-\ning armies of Rome. The militias of some barbarous nations defended\nthemselves much better. The Scythian or Tartar militia, which Mithrid-\nates drew from the countries north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, were\nthe most formidable enemies whom the Romans had to encounter after\nthe second Carthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias, too,\nwerealwaysrespectable,anduponseveraloccasionsgainedveryconsider-\n545", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nable advantages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when\nthe Roman armies were well commanded, they appear to have been very\nmuchsuperior;andiftheRomansdidnotpursuethefinalconquesteither\nof Parthia or Germany, it was probably because they judged that it was\nnot worth while to add those two barbarous countries to an empire which\nwas already too large. The ancient Parthians appear to have been a na-\ntion of Scythian or Tartar extraction, and to have always retained a good G.ed.p704\ndeal of the manners of their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like\nthe Scythians or Tartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to\nwarunderthesamechiefswhomtheywereaccustomedtofollowinpeace.\nTheir militia was exactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or\nTartars,fromwhom,too,theywereprobablydescended.\n1542 [36] ManydifferentcausescontributedtorelaxthedisciplineoftheRoman\narmies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the\ndaysoftheirgrandeur,whennoenemyappearedcapableofopposingthem,\ntheirheavyarmourwaslaidasideasunnecessarilyburdensome, theirla-\nbourious exercises were neglected as unnecessarily toilsome.

It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen, which,\nin time of war, took the field under the command of the same chieftains\nwhomitwasaccustomedtoobeyinpeace. Itwas,therefore,tolerablywell\nexercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and industry advanced,\nhowever, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great\nbody of the people had less time to spare for military exercises. Both the\ndisciplineandtheexerciseofthefeudalmilitia, therefore,wentgradually\ntoruin,andstandingarmiesweregraduallyintroducedtosupplytheplace\nof it. When the expedient of a standing army, besides, had once been ad-\nopted by one civilised nation, it became necessary that all its neighbours\nshould follow their example. They soon found that their safety depended\nupontheirdoingso,andthattheirownmilitiawasaltogetherincapableof\nresistingtheattackofsuchanarmy.\n1544 [38] The soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen an\nenemy, yethavefrequentlyappearedtopossessallthecourageofveteran\ntroops and the very moment that they took the field to have been fit to\nface the hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Rus-\nsianarmymarchedintoPoland,thevalouroftheRussiansoldiersdidnot\nappear inferior to that of the Prussians, at that time supposed to be the\nhardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The Russian empire,\nhowever, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and\ncould at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy.\nWhen the Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a pro-\nfound peace for about eight-and-twenty years. The valour of her soldiers,\nhowever,farfrombeingcorruptedbythatlongpeace,wasnevermoredis-\ntinguishedthanintheattemptuponCarthagena,thefirstunfortunateex-\nploit of that unfortunate war. In a long peace the generals, perhaps, may\nsometimes forget their skill; but, where a well-regulated standing army\nhasbeenkeptup,thesoldiersseemnevertoforgettheirvalour.\n1545 [39] When a civilised nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at\nalltimesexposedtobeconqueredbyanybarbarousnationwhichhappens\ntobeinitsneighbourhood. Thefrequentconquestsofallthecivilisedcoun-\ntries in Asia by the Tartars sufficiently demonstrates the natural superi-\noritywhichthemilitiaofabarbaroushasoverthatofacivilisednation. A\nwell-regulated standing army is superior to every militia. Such an army, G.ed.p706\nas it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilised nation, so it can\nalone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and barbarous\nneighbour. It is only by means of a standing army, therefore, that the\ncivilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even preserved for any\nconsiderabletime.\n1546 [40] Asitisonlybymeansofawell-regulatedstandingarmythatacivilised\ncountrycanbedefended,soitisonlybymeansofitthatabarbarouscoun-\n547", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntry can be suddenly and tolerably civilised. A standing army establishes,\nwith an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign through the remotest\nprovincesoftheempire,andmaintainssomedegreeofregulargovernment\nin countries which could not otherwise admit of any. Whoever examines,\nwith attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced into\nthe Russian empire, will find that they almost all resolve themselves into\nthe establishment of a well regulated standingarmy. It is theinstrument\nwhich executes and maintains all his other regulations. That degree of\norderandinternalpeacewhichthatempirehaseversinceenjoyedisalto-\ngetherowingtotheinfluenceofthatarmy.\n1547 [41] Men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as\ndangerous to liberty. It certainly is so wherever the interest of the gen-\neral and that of the principal officers are not necessarily connected with\nthe support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of Caesar\ndestroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwell turned\nthe Long Parliament out of doors. But where the sovereign is himself the\ngeneral, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief of-\nficers of the army, where the military force is placed under the command\nof those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil author-\nity, because they have themselves the greatest share of that authority, a\nstanding army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the contrary, it may G.ed.p707\nin some cases be favourable to liberty. The security which it gives to the\nsovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome jealousy, which, in some\nmodern republics, seems to watch over the minutest actions, and to be at\nalltimesreadytodisturbthepeaceofeverycitizen. Wherethesecurityof\nthemagistrate,thoughsupportedbytheprincipalpeopleofthecountry,is\nendangered by every popular discontent; where a small tumult is capable\nof bringing about in a few hours a great revolution, the whole authority\nof government must be employed to suppress and punish every murmur\nand complaint against it. To a sovereign, on the contrary, who feels him-\nself supported, not only by the natural aristocracy of the country, but by\na well-regulated standing army, the rudest, the most groundless, and the\nmost licentious remonstrances can give little disturbance. He can safely\npardon or neglect them, and his consciousness of his own superiority nat-\nurally disposes him to do so. That degree of liberty which approaches to\nlicentiousnesscanbetoleratedonlyincountrieswherethesovereignisse-\ncured by a well-regulated standing army. It is in such countries only that\nthepublicsafetydoesnotrequirethatthesovereignshouldbetrustedwith\nanydiscretionarypowerforsuppressingeventheimpertinentwantonness\nofthislicentiousliberty.\n1548 [42] The first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the soci-\nety from the violence and injustice of other independent societies, grows\ngraduallymoreandmoreexpensiveasthesocietyadvancesincivilization.\nThemilitaryforceofthesociety,whichoriginallycostthesovereignnoex-\npense either in time of peace or in time of war, must, in the progress of\n548", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nimprovement, first be maintained by him in time of war, and afterwards\nevenintimeofpeace.\n1549 [43] The great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of\nfirearmshasenhancedstillfurtherboththeexpenseofexercisinganddis-\nciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and that of\nemploying them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition\nare become more expensive. A musket is a more expensive machine than G.ed.p708\na javelin or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar than a balista or a\ncatapulta. Thepowderwhichisspentinamodernreviewislostirrecover-\nably, and occasions a very considerable expense. The javeline and arrows\nwhich were thrown or shot in an ancient one could easily be picked up\nagain, and were besides of very little value.

Asthesuperiorityofthemodernartillerytoo\nover that of the ancients is very great, it has become much more difficult,\nand consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town so as to resist\nevenforafewweekstheattackofthatsuperiorartillery.

Theunavoidableeffectsofthenaturalprogressofimprovement\nhave, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great revolution in\ntheartofwar,towhichamereaccident,theinventionofgunpowder,seems\ntohavegivenoccasion.\n1550 [44] In modern war the great expense of firearms gives an evident advant-\nagetothenationwhichcanbestaffordthatexpense, andconsequentlyto\nanopulentandcivilisedoverapoorandbarbarousnation.

Inmoderntimesthepoorandbarbarousfind\nit difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilised. The\ninvention of firearms, an invention which at first sight appears to be so\npernicious, is certainly favourable both to the permanency and to the ex-\ntensionofcivilization.\nPART THIRD\nOf the Expense of Justice\n1551 [1] The second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible,\neverymemberofthesocietyfromtheinjusticeoroppressionofeveryother\nmemberofit,orthedutyofestablishinganexactadministrationofjustice, G.ed.p709\nrequires, too, very different degrees of expense in the different periods of\nsociety.\n1552 [2] Among nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least\n549", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnone that exceeds the value of two or three days\u2019 labour, so there is sel-\ndom any established magistrate or any regular administration of justice.\nMenwhohavenopropertycaninjureoneanotheronlyintheirpersonsor\nreputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames another,\nthough he to whom the injury is done suffers, he who does it receives no\nbenefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to property. The benefit of the\npersonwhodoestheinjuryisoftenequaltothelossofhimwhosuffersit.\nEnvy, malice, or resentment are the only passions which can prompt one\nmantoinjureanotherinhispersonorreputation. Butthegreaterpartof\nmenarenotveryfrequentlyundertheinfluenceofthosepassions,andthe\nvery worst of men are so only occasionally. As their gratification too, how\nagreeablesoeveritmaybetocertaincharacters, isnotattendedwithany\nreal or permanent advantage, it is in the greater part of men commonly\nrestrainedbyprudentialconsiderations. Menmaylivetogetherinsociety\nwith some tolerabledegree ofsecurity, thoughthere isno civilmagistrate\nto protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and am-\nbition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present\nease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property,\npassions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal\nintheirinfluence. Whereverthereisgreatpropertythereisgreatinequal- G.ed.p710\nity. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and\ntheaffluenceofthefewsupposestheindigenceofthemany. Theaffluence\nof the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven\nbywant,andpromptedbyenvy,toinvadehispossessions.

Where there is no prop-\nerty, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days\u2019 labour,\ncivilgovernmentisnotsonecessary.\n1553 [3] Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the neces-\nsityofcivilgovernmentgraduallygrowsupwiththeacquisitionofvaluable\nproperty, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination\ngraduallygrowupwiththegrowthofthatvaluableproperty.\n1554 [4] The causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination,\norwhichnaturally,andantecedenttoanycivilinstitution,givesomemen\nsomesuperiorityoverthegreaterpartoftheirbrethren,seemtobefourin\nnumber.\n1555 [5] Thefirstofthosecausesorcircumstancesisthesuperiorityofpersonal G.ed.p711\nqualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom and vir-\ntue, of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The qualific-\n550", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nations of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can give little\nauthority in any period of society. He is a very strong man, who, by mere\nstrength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The qualifications\nof the mind can alone give a very great authority. They are, however, in-\nvisible qualities; always disputable, and generally disputed. No society,\nwhether barbarous or civilised, has ever found it convenient to settle the\nrulesofprecedencyofrankandsubordinationaccordingtothoseinvisible\nqualities;butaccordingtosomethingthatismoreplainandpalpable.\n1556 [6] The second of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of age.\nAnoldman,providedhisageisnotsofaradvancedastogivesuspicionof\ndotage,iseverywheremorerespectedthanayoungmanofequalrank,for-\ntune,andabilities.

The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of so-\nciety, is perhaps greatest in the rudest age of society which admits of any\nconsiderable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose G.ed.p711\nherdsandstocksissufficienttomaintainathousandmen,cannotwellem-\nploythatincreaseinanyotherwaythaninmaintainingathousandmen.\nThe rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured pro-\nduce, any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that\npartofhisrudeproducewhichisoverandabovehisownconsumption.

All families are equally ancient; and the\nancestors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well\nbe more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity of family means\neverywhere the antiquity either of wealth, or of that greatness which is\ncommonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied with it. Upstart\ngreatnessiseverywherelessrespectedthanancientgreatness. Thehatred\nof usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch, are, in a great\nmeasure, founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the\nformer, and upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer sub-\nmits without reluctance to the authority of a superior by whom he has\nalways been commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior should be set\nover his head, so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their\nancestorshavealwayssubmitted;butarefiredwithindignationwhenan-\notherfamily, inwhomtheyhadneveracknowledgedanysuchsuperiority,\nassumesadominionoverthem.\n1559 [9] The distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune,\ncanhavenoplaceinnationsofhunters,amongwhomallmen,beingequal\nin fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth.

Thedifference,however,willnotbeverygreat;andthere G.ed.p714\nnever was, I believe, a great family in the world whose illustration was\nentirelyderivedfromtheinheritanceofwisdomandvirtue.\n1560 [10] Thedistinctionofbirthnotonlymay,butalwaysdoestakeplaceamong\nnations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of\nluxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by\nimprovidentprofusion.

They are the two great sources of per-\nsonal distinction, and are therefore the principal causes which naturally\n552", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nestablishauthorityandsubordinationamongmen. Amongnationsofshep-\nherds both those causes operate with their full force. The great shepherd\nor herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of the great\nnumberofthosewhodependuponhimforsubsistence,andreveredonac-\ncountofthenoblenessofhisbirth,andoftheimmemorialantiquityofhis\nillustrious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior shepherds\nor herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command the united force of a\ngreaternumberofpeoplethananyofthem. Hismilitarypowerisgreater\nthan that of any of them. In time of war they are all of them naturally\ndisposed to muster themselves under his banner, rather than under that\nof any other person, and his birth and fortune thus naturally procure to\nhim some sort of executive power. By commanding, too, the united force\nof a greater number of people than any of them, he is best able to compel\nany one of them who may have injured another to compensate the wrong.\nHeistheperson, therefore, towhomallthosewhoaretooweaktodefend\nthemselves naturally look up for protection.

It thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which\nis indispensably necessary for its own preservation: and it seems to do\nthisnaturally,andevenindependentoftheconsiderationofthatnecessity.\nThe consideration of that necessity comes no doubt afterwards to contrib-\nute very much to maintain and secure that authority and subordination.\nThe rich, in particular, are necessarily interested to support that order of\nthingswhichcanalonesecuretheminthepossessionoftheirownadvant-\nages. Menofinferiorwealthcombinetodefendthoseofsuperiorwealthin\nthepossessionoftheirproperty,inorderthatmenofsuperiorwealthmay\ncombine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shep-\nherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks\ndepends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman;\nthat the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his\ngreater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his\npowerofkeepingtheirinferiorsinsubordinationtothem. Theyconstitute\na sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the prop-\nertyandtosupporttheauthorityoftheirownlittlesovereigninorderthat\nhe may be able to defend their property and to support their authority.\nCivil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is\ninrealityinstitutedforthedefenceoftherichagainstthepoor,orofthose\nwhohavesomepropertyagainstthosewhohavenoneatall.\n1563 [13] The judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a\n553", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncause of expense, was for a long time a source of revenue to him. The\npersons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it,\nand a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority\nof the sovereign, too, was thoroughly established, the person found guilty,\noverandabovethesatisfactionwhichhewasobligedtomaketotheparty,\nwaslikewiseforcedtopayanamercementtothesovereign. Hehadgiven\ntrouble,hehaddisturbed,hehadbrokethepeaceofhislordtheking,and G.ed.p716\nfor those offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar govern-\nments of Asia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by the\nGermanandScythiannationswhooverturnedtheRomanempire,thead-\nministration of justice was a considerable source of revenue, both to the\nsovereignandtoallthelesserchiefsorlordswhoexercisedunderhimany\nparticular jurisdiction, either over some particular tribe or clan, or over\nsomeparticularterritoryordistrict.

In those days the administration of justice not only\nafforded a certain revenue to the sovereign, but to procure this revenue\nseems to have been one of the principal advantages which he proposed to\nobtainbytheadministrationofjustice.\n1564 [14] Thisschemeofmakingtheadministrationofjusticesubservienttothe\npurposesofrevenuecouldscarcefailtobeproductiveofseveralverygross\nabuses.

Justice,too,might\nfrequently be delayed in order that this present might be repeated. The\namercement, besides, of the person complained of, might frequently sug- G.ed.p717\ngest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong, even when he had\nnot really been so. That such abuses were far from being uncommon the\nancienthistoryofeverycountryinEuropebearswitness.\n1565 [15] Whenthesovereignorchiefexercisedhisjudicialauthorityinhisown\nperson,howmuchsoeverhemightabuseit,itmusthavebeenscarcepos-\nsible to get any redress, because there could seldom be anybody powerful\nenough to call him to account.

But if it was for the benefit of his sovereign, if it was in order to\n1[Smith]TheyaretobefoundinTyrrell\u2019sHistoryofEngland.\n554", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmake court to the person who appointed him and who might prefer him,\nthathehadcommittedanyactofoppression,redresswoulduponmostoc-\ncasions be as impossible as if the sovereign had committed it himself. In\nall barbarous governments, accordingly, in all those ancient governments\nof Europe in particular which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman\nempire, theadministrationofjusticeappearsforalongtimetohavebeen\nextremely corrupt, far from being quite equal and impartial even under\nthebestmonarchs,andaltogetherprofligateundertheworst.\n1566 [16] Among nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only the\ngreatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is maintained in\nthe same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the increase of his\nownherdsorflocks. Amongthosenationsofhusbandmenwhoarebutjust\ncome out of the shepherd state, and who are not much advanced beyond\nthatstate,suchastheGreektribesappeartohavebeenaboutthetimeof\nthe Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors when they first\nsettled upon the ruins of the western empire, the sovereign or chief is, in\nthe same manner, only the greatest landlord of the country, and is main-\ntained, in the same manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived\nfrom his own private estate, or from what, in modern Europe, was called\nthe demesne of the crown. His subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contrib-\nuted nothing to his support, except when, in order to protect them from\nthe oppression of some of their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his\nauthority. Thepresentswhichtheymakehimuponsuchoccasionsconsti-\ntute the whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, ex-\ncept perhaps upon some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from\nhis dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles G.ed.p718\nfor his friendship the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advant-\nage which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was that the people\nwouldhonourhimwithpresents. Aslongassuchpresents, aslongasthe\nemolumentsofjustice,orwhatmaybecalledthefeesofcourt,constituted\nin this manner the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived\nfrom his sovereignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even de-\ncently be proposed, that he should give them up altogether. It might, and\nit frequently was proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them.\nButaftertheyhadbeensoregulatedandascertained,howtohinderaper-\nson who was all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations\nwas still very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of\nthisstateofthings,therefore,thecorruptionofjustice,naturallyresulting\nfromthearbitraryanduncertainnatureofthosepresents,scarceadmitted\nofanyeffectualremedy.\n1567 [17] But when from different causes, chiefly from the continually increas-\ningexpensesofdefendingthenationagainsttheinvasionofothernations,\nthe private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for\ndefraying the expense of the sovereignty, and when it had become neces-\nsarythatthepeopleshould,fortheirownsecurity,contributetowardsthis\n555", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nexpense by taxes of different kinds, it seems to have been very commonly\nstipulated that no present for the administration of justice should, under\nanypretence,beacceptedeitherbythesovereign,orbyhisbailiffsandsub-\nstitutes,thejudges. Thosepresents,itseemstohavebeensupposed,could\nmore easily be abolished altogether than effectually regulated and ascer-\ntained. Fixedsalarieswereappointedtothejudges,whichweresupposed\nto compensate to them the loss of whatever might have been their share\noftheancientemolumentsofjustice,asthetaxesmorethancompensated\nto the sovereign the loss of his. Justice was then said to be administered\ngratis.\n1568 [18] Justice,however,neverwasinrealityadministeredgratisinanycoun-\ntry. Lawyers and attorneys, at least, must always be paid by the parties;\nand, if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than\nthey actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attor-\nneys amount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the salaries of\nthe judges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown\ncan nowhere much diminish the necessary expense of a law-suit. But it\nwas not so much to diminish the expense, as to prevent the corruption of G.ed.p719\njustice, that the judges were prohibited from receiving any present or fee\nfromtheparties.\n1569 [19] The office of judge is in itself so very honourable that men are willing\nto accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The in-\nferiorofficeofjusticeofpeace,thoughattendedwithagooddealoftrouble,\nand in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of ambition to\nthegreaterpartofourcountrygentlemen.

Thosefees,withoutoccasioning\nany considerable increase in the expense of a lawsuit, might be rendered\n556", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfully sufficient for defraying the whole expense of justice. By not being\npaid to the judges till the process was determined, they might be some\nincitement to the diligence of the court in examining and deciding it. In\ncourts which consisted of a considerable number of judges, by proportion-\ningtheshareofeachjudgetothenumberofhoursanddayswhichhehad\nemployed in examining the process, either in the court or in a committee\nby order of the court, those fees might give some encouragement to the\ndiligence of each particular judge. Public services are never better per-\nformed than when their reward comes only in consequence of their being\nperformed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing\nthem. In the different parliaments of France, the fees of court (called epi- G.ed.p720\ncesandvacations)constitutethefargreaterpartoftheemolumentsofthe\njudges.

Those\nParliaments are perhaps, in many respects, not very convenient courts of\njustice; but they have never been accused, they seem never even to have\nbeensuspected,ofcorruption.\n1571 [21] The fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of\nthedifferentcourtsofjusticeinEngland. Eachcourtendeavouredtodraw\ntoitselfasmuchbusinessasitcould, andwas, uponthataccount, willing\nto take cognisance of many suits which were not originally intended to\nfall under its jurisdiction. The Court of King\u2019s Bench, instituted for the\ntrial of criminal causes only, took cognisance of civil suits; the plaintiff\npretendingthatthedefendant,innotdoinghimjustice,hadbeenguiltyof\nsometrespassormisdemeanour.

Thepresent\nadmirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps,\noriginally in a great measure formed by this emulation which anciently\ntook place between their respective judges; each judge endeavouring to\ngive, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the\nlaw would admit for every sort of injustice. Originally the courts of law\ngave damages only for breach of contract. The Court of Chancery, as a\ncourtofconscience,firsttookuponittoenforcethespecificperformanceof\n557", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nagreements. Whenthebreachofcontractconsistedinthenon-paymentof\nmoney, the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than\nbyorderingpayment,whichwasequivalenttoaspecificperformanceofthe\nagreement. In such cases, therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was\nsufficient. Itwasnotsoinothers. Whenthetenantsuedhislordforhaving G.ed.p721\nunjustly outed him of his lease, the damages which he recovered were by\nnomeansequivalenttothepossessionoftheland. Suchcauses,therefore,\nfor some time, went all to the Court of Chancery, to the no small loss of\nthe courts of law. It was to draw back such causes to themselves that the\ncourts of law are said to have invented the artificial and fictitious Writ of\nEjectment,themosteffectualremedyforanunjustouterordispossession\nofland.\n1572 [22] A stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be\nlevied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges\nand other officers belonging to it, might, in the same manner, afford rev-\nenue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of justice,\nwithoutbringinganyburdenuponthegeneralrevenueofthesociety. The\njudges indeed might, in this case, be under the temptation of multiplying\nunnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order to increase, as\nmuch as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It has been the cus-\ntom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions, the payment of\nthe attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of pages which\nthey had occasion to write; the court, however, requiring that each page\nshould contain so many lines, and each line so many words. In order to\nincrease their payment, the attorneys and clerks have contrived to mul-\ntiplywordsbeyondallnecessity,tothecorruptionofthelawlanguageof,I\nbelieve,everycourtofjusticeinEurope. Aliketemptationmightperhaps\noccasionalikecorruptionintheformoflawproceedings.\n1573 [23] But whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray\nitsownexpense,orwhetherthejudgesbemaintainedbyfixedsalariespaid\ntothemfromsomeotherfund,itdoesnotseemnecessarythattheperson\norpersonsentrustedwiththeexecutivepowershouldbechargedwiththe\nmanagement of that fund, or with the payment of those salaries.

Apart,thoughindeedbutasmallpart,\nof the salary of the judges of the Court of Session in Scotland arises from G.ed.p722\nthe interest of a sum of money. The necessary instability of such a fund\nseems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of an\ninstitutionwhichoughttolastforever.\n1574 [24] Theseparationofthejudicialfromtheexecutivepowerseemsoriginally\nto have arisen from the increasing business of the society, in consequence\nofitsincreasingimprovement. Theadministrationofjusticebecamesola-\n558", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nboriousandsocomplicatedadutyastorequiretheundividedattentionof\nthe persons to whom it was entrusted. The person entrusted with the ex-\necutivepowernothavingleisuretoattendtothedecisionofprivatecauses\nhimself, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead. In the pro-\ngress of the Roman greatness, the consul was too much occupied with the\npolitical affairs of the state to attend to the administration of justice. A\npraetor,therefore,wasappointedtoadministeritinhisstead. Inthepro-\ngress of the European monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of\ntheRomanempire,thesovereignsandthegreatlordscameuniversallyto\nconsider the administration of justice as an office both too laborious and\ntoo ignoble for them to execute in their own persons. They universally,\ntherefore, discharged themselves of it by appointing a deputy, bailiff, or\njudge.\n1575 [25] Whenthejudicialisunitedtotheexecutivepower,itisscarcepossible\nthat justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly called\npolities.

Theinstitutionsforinstructionareof\ntwokinds: thosefortheeducationofyouth,andthosefortheinstructionof\npeople of all ages. The consideration of the manner in which the expense\nofthosedifferentsortsofpublic,worksandinstitutionsmaybemostprop-\nerly defrayed will divide this third part of the present chapter into three\ndifferentarticles.\nARTICLE I\nG.ed.p724\nOfthePublicWorksandInstitutionsforfacilitating\ntheCommerceoftheSociety\nAnd,first,ofthosewhicharenecessaryforfacilitating\nCommerceingeneral\n1578 [1] Thattheerectionandmaintenanceofthepublicworkswhichfacilitatethe\ncommerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals,\nharbours,etc.,mustrequireverydifferentdegreesofexpenseinthediffer-\nentperiodsofsocietyisevidentwithoutanyproof. Theexpenseofmaking\nand maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently increase\nwith the annual produce of the land and labour of that country, or with\nthe quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to fetch\nandcarryuponthoseroads. Thestrengthofabridgemustbesuitedtothe\nnumber and weight of the carriages which are likely to pass over it. The\ndepthandthesupplyofwaterforanavigablecanalmustbeproportioned\nto the number and tonnage of the lighters which are likely to carry goods\nupon it; the extent of a harbour to the number of the shipping which are\nlikelytotakeshelterinit.\n1579 [2] It does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works\nshould be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of\nwhich the collection and application is in most countries assigned to the\nexecutive power. The greater part of such public works may easily be so\nmanaged as to afford a particular revenue sufficient for defraying their\nown expense, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of\nthesociety.\n1580 [3] Ahighway,abridge,anavigablecanal,forexample,mayinmostcases\nbe both made and maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which\nmake use of them: a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the tonnage\nof the shipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another institu-\ntionforfacilitatingcommerce,inmanycountries,notonlydefraysitsown\n560", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nexpense, but affords a small revenue or seignorage to the sovereign. The\npost-office, another institution for the same purpose, over and above de-\nfrayingitsownexpense,affordsinalmostallcountriesaveryconsiderable\nrevenuetothesovereign.\n1581 [4] When the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the\nlighters which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their\nweight or their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public\nworks exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of G.ed.p725\nthem. Itseemsscarcepossibletoinventamoreequitablewayofmaintain-\ning such works. This tax or toll too, though it is advanced by the carrier,\nisfinallypaidbytheconsumer,towhomitmustalwaysbechargedinthe\nprice of the goods. As the expense of carriage, however, is very much re-\nduced by means of such public works, the goods, notwithstanding the toll\ncome cheaper to the consumer than the; could otherwise have done; their\npricenotbeingsomuchraisedbythetollasitisloweredbythecheapness\nof the carriage. The person who finally pays this tax, therefore, gains by\nthe application more than he loses by the payment of it. His payment is\nexactly in proportion to his gain. It is in reality no more than a part of\nthat gain which he is obliged to give up in order to get the rest. It seems\nimpossibletoimagineamoreequitablemethodofraisingatax.\n1582 [5] Whenthetolluponcarriagesofluxuryuponcoaches,post-chaises,etc.,\nismadesomewhathigherinproportiontotheirweightthanuponcarriages\nof necessary use, such as carts, waggons, etc., the indolence and vanity of\nthe rich is made to contribute in a very easy manner to the relief of the\npoor, by rendering cheaper the transportation of heavy goods to all the\ndifferentpartsofthecountry.\n1583 [6] When high roads, bridges, canals, etc., are in this manner made and\nsupported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they\ncan be made only where that commerce requires them, and consequently\nwhere it is proper to make them. Their expenses too, their grandeur and\nmagnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay.\nThey must be made consequently as it is proper to make them. A magni-\nficent high road cannot be made through a desert country where there is\nlittle or no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to the coun-\ntry villa of the intendant of the province, or to that of some great lord to\nwhom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge\ncannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes, or merely\nto embellish the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace: things\nwhichsometimeshappenincountrieswhereworksofthiskindarecarried\non by any other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of\naffording.\n1584 [7] In several different parts of Europe the ton or lock-duty upon a canal\nis the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them to\nkeep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation ne-\ncessarily ceases altogether, and along with it the whole profit which they\n561", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncan make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under the management of G.ed.p726\ncommissioners, who had themselves no interest in them, they might be\nlessattentivetothemaintenanceoftheworkswhichproducedthem. The\ncanal of Languedoc cost the King of France and the province upwards of\nthirteenmillionsoflivres,which(attwenty-eightlivresthemarkofsilver,\nthevalueofFrenchmoneyintheendofthelastcentury)amountedtoup-\nwards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling. When that great work\nwas finished, the most likely method, it was found, of keeping it in con-\nstantrepairwastomakeapresentofthetollstoRiquettheengineer,who\nplanned and conducted the work. Those tolls constitute at present a very\nlargeestatetothedifferentbranchesofthefamilyofthatgentleman,who\nhave, therefore, a great interest to keep the work in constant repair. But\nhadthosetollsbeenputunderthemanagementofcommissioners,whohad\nno such interest, they might perhaps have been dissipated in ornamental\nandunnecessaryexpenses,whilethemostessentialpartsoftheworkwere\nallowedtogotoruin.\n1585 [8] The tolls for the maintenance of a high road cannot with any safety\nbe made the property of private persons. A high road, though entirely\nneglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does.\nTheproprietorsofthetollsuponahighroad,therefore,mightneglectalto-\ngethertherepairoftheroad,andyetcontinuetolevyverynearlythesame\ntolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the maintenance of such a\nworkshouldbeputunderthemanagementofcommissionersortrustees.\n1586 [9] InGreatBritain,theabuseswhichthetrusteeshavecommittedinthe\nmanagementofthosetollshaveinmanycasesbeenveryjustlycomplained\nof. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is more than\ndouble of what is necessary for executing, in the completest manner, the\nworkwhichisoftenexecutedinveryslovenlymanner,andsometimesnot\nexecuted at all. The system of repairing the high roads by tolls of this\nkind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing. We should not\nwonder,therefore,ifithasnotyetbeenbroughttothatdegreeofperfection\nof which it seems capable.

Theplanitself,however,seemsliabletoseveralveryimportant\nobjections.\n1589 [12] First, if the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be con-\nsidered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the state,\nthey would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed to\nrequire. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they would\nprobablybeaugmentedveryfast. Thefacilitywithwhichagreatrevenue\ncouldbedrawnfromthemwouldprobablyencourageadministrationtore-\ncurveryfrequentlytothisresource. Thoughitmay,perhaps,bemorethan\ndoubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of the\npresent tolls, it can scarce be doubted but that a million might be saved\nout of them if they were doubled: and perhaps two millions if they were\ntripled3. Thisgreatrevenue,too,mightbeleviedwithouttheappointment\nofasinglenewofficertocollectandreceiveit. Buttheturnpiketollsbeing\ncontinually augmented in this manner, instead of facilitating the inland\ncommerceofthecountryasatpresent,wouldsoonbecomeaverygreatin-\ncumbranceuponit. Theexpenseoftransportingallheavygoodsfromone\npart of the country to another would soon be so much increased, the mar-\nketforallsuchgoods,consequently,wouldsoonbesomuchnarrowed,that G.ed.p728\ntheir production would be in a great measure discouraged, and the most\nimportant branches of the domestic industry of the country annihilated\naltogether.\n1590 [13] Secondly, a tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight, though a\nveryequaltaxwhenappliedtothesolepurposeofrepairingtheroads,isa\nveryunequalonewhenappliedtoanyotherpurpose,ortosupplythecom-\nmon exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the sole purpose above\nmentioned,eachcarriageissupposedtopayexactlyforthewearandtear\nwhich that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to any\nother purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that wear\nandtear,andcontributestothesupplyofsomeotherexigencyofthestate.\n2[Smith]Sincepublishingthetwofirsteditionsofthisbook,Ihavegotgoodreasonsto\nbelievethatallthetunrpiketollsleviedinGreatBritaindonotproduceaneatrevenuethat\namountstohalfamillion;asumwhich,underthemanagementofGovernment,wouldnotbe\nsufficienttokeepinrepairfiveoftheprincipalroadsinthekingdom.\n3[Smith]Ihavenowgoodreasonstobelievethatalltheseconjecturalsumsarebymuch\ntoolarge.\n563", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nBut as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to their\nweight,andnottotheirvalue,itischieflypaidbytheconsumersofcoarse\nand bulky, not by those of precious and light, commodities. Whatever ex-\nigency of the state therefore this tax might be intended to supply, that\nexigencywouldbechieflysuppliedattheexpenseofthepoor,nottherich;\nattheexpenseofthosewhoareleastabletosupplyit,notofthosewhoare\nmostable.\n1591 [14] Thirdly,ifgovernmentshouldatanytimeneglectthereparationofthe\nhigh roads, it would be still more difficult than it is at present to compel\nthe proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large revenue\nmight thus be levied upon the people without any part of it being applied\nto the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought ever\nto be applied. If the meanness and poverty of the trustees of turnpike\nroadsrenderitsometimesdifficultatpresenttoobligethemtorepairtheir\nwrong,theirwealthandgreatnesswouldrenderittentimesmoresointhe\ncasewhichisheresupposed.\n1592 [15] In France, the funds destined for the reparation of high roads are un-\nder the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist\npartly in a certain number of days\u2019 labour which the country people are\nin most parts of Europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways,\nandpartlyinsuchaportionofthegeneralrevenueofthestateastheking\nchoosestosparefromhisotherexpenses.\n1593 [16] By the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of\nEurope,thelabourofthecountrypeoplewasunderthedirectionofalocal\nor provincial magistracy, which had no immediate dependency upon the\nking\u2019s council. But by the present practice both the labour of the people,\nand whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for the repara- G.ed.p729\ntionofthehighroadsinanyparticularprovinceorgenerality,areentirely\nunder the management of the intendant; an officer who is appointed and\nremoved by the king\u2019s council, and who receives his orders from it, and is\nin constant correspondence with it. In the progress of despotism the au-\nthorityoftheexecutivepowergraduallyabsorbsthatofeveryotherpower\ninthestate,andassumestoitselfthemanagementofeverybranchofrev-\nenue which is destined for any public purpose. In France, however, the\ngreat post-roads, the roads which make the communication between the\nprincipal towns of the kingdom, are in general kept in good order, and in\nsome provinces are even a good deal superior to the greater part of the\nturnpike roads of England. But what we call the cross-roads, that is, the\nfar greater part of the roads in the country, are entirely neglected, and\nareinmanyplacesabsolutelyimpassableforanyheavycarriage.

But to execute a great num-\nber oflittle works, in which nothing that can bedone canmake anygreat\nappearance, or excite the smallest degree of admiration in any traveller,\nand which, in short, have nothing to recommend them but their extreme\nutility, is a business which appears in every respect too mean and paltry\ntomerittheattentionofsogreatamagistrate. Undersuchanadministra-\ntion,therefore,suchworksarealmostalwaysentirelyneglected.\n1594 [17] In China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive\npower charges itself both with the reparation of the high roads and with\nthe maintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are\ngiven to the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are con-\nstantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of\nhis conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to\nhave paid to this part of his instructions. This branch of public police ac-\ncordingly is said to be very much attended to in all those countries, but\nparticularly in China, where the high roads, and still more the navig-\nablecanals,itispretended,exceedverymucheverythingofthesamekind\nwhich is known in Europe. The accounts of those works, however, which\nhave been transmitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by weak\nand wondering travellers; frequently by stupid and lying missionaries. If\nthey had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if the accounts of\nthem had been reported by more faithful witnesses, they would not, per- G.ed.p730\nhaps,appeartobesowonderful. TheaccountwhichBerniergivesofsome\nworks of this kind in Indostan falls very much short of what had been re-\nported of them by other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous than\nhewas. Itmaytoo,perhaps,beinthosecountries,asinFrance,wherethe\ngreat roads, the great communications which are likely to be the subjects\nofconversationatthecourtandinthecapital,areattendedto,andallthe\nrestneglected. InChina,besides,inIndostan,andinseveralothergovern-\nments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign arises almost altogether from\na land tax or land rent, which rises or falls with the rise and fall of the\nannualproduceoftheland. Thegreatinterestofthesovereign,therefore,\nhis revenue, is in such countries necessarily and immediately connected\nwith the cultivation of the land, with the greatness of its produce, and\nwith the value of its produce. But in order to render that produce both\nas great and as valuable as possible, it is necessary to procure to it as ex-\ntensiveamarketaspossible,andconsequentlytoestablishthefreest,the\neasiest, and the least expensive communication between all the different\nparts of the country; which can be done only by means of the best roads\nand the best navigable canals. But the revenue of the sovereign does not,\ninanypartofEurope,arisechieflyfromalandtaxorlandrent. Inallthe\ngreat kingdoms of Europe, perhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately\ndependupontheproduceoftheland: butthatdependencyisneithersoim-\nmediate, nor so evident. In Europe, therefore, the sovereign does not feel\nhimself so directly called upon to promote the increase, both in quantity\n565", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nand value, of the produce of the land, or, by maintaining good roads and\ncanals, to provide the most extensive market for that produce. Though it\nshould be true, therefore, what I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that\ninsomepartsofAsiathisdepartmentofthepublicpoliceisveryproperly\nmanaged by the executive power, there is not the least probability that,\nduring the present state of things, it could be tolerably managed by that\npowerinanypartofEurope.\n1595 [18] Even those public works which are of such a nature that they cannot\nafford any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the conveni-\nencyisnearlyconfinedtosomeparticularplaceordistrict,arealwaysbet-\nter maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management\nofalocalorprovincialadministration, thanbythegeneralrevenueofthe\nstate, of which the executive power must always have the management.\nWere the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the expense of the\ntreasury, is there any probability that they would be so well lighted and G.ed.p731\npavedastheyareatpresent,orevenatsosmallanexpense? Theexpense,\nbesides,insteadofbeingraisedbyalocaltaxupontheinhabitantsofeach\nparticular street, parish, or district in London, would, in this case, be de-\nfrayed out of the general revenue of the state, and would consequently\nbe raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the\ngreater part derive no sort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the\nstreetsofLondon.\n1596 [19] Theabuseswhichsometimescreepintothelocalandprovincialadmin-\nistrationofalocalandprovincialrevenue,howenormoussoevertheymay\nappear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling in comparison\nof those which commonly take place in the administration and expendit-\nureoftherevenueofagreatempire. Theyare, besides, muchmoreeasily\ncorrected. Under the local or provincial administration of the justices of\nthe peace in Great Britain, the six days\u2019 labour which the country people\nareobligedtogivetothereparationofthehighwaysisnotalwaysperhaps\nvery judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever exacted with any circum-\nstances of cruelty or oppression. In France, under the administration of\ntheintendants,theapplicationisnotalwaysmorejudicious,andtheexac-\ntionisfrequentlythemostcruelandoppressive. SuchCorvees,astheyare\ncalled, make one of the principal instruments of tyranny by which those\nofficerschastiseanyparishorcommunautewhichhashadthemisfortune\ntofallundertheirdispleasure.\nOfthePublicWorksandInstitutionswhicharenecessary\nforfacilitatingparticularBranchesofCommerce\n1597 [1] The object of the public works and institutions above mentioned is to fa-\ncilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular\n566", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbranchesofit,particularinstitutionsarenecessary,whichagainrequirea\nparticularandextraordinaryexpense.\n1598 [2] Someparticularbranchesofcommerce, whicharecarriedonwithbar-\nbarous and uncivilised nations, require extraordinary protection.

Thedisordersinthegovernment G.ed.p732\nofIndostanhavebeensupposedtorenderalikeprecautionnecessaryeven\namong that mild and gentle people; and it was under pretence of secur-\ning their persons and property from violence that both the English and\nFrench East India Companies were allowed to erect the first forts which\ntheypossessedinthatcountry. Amongothernations,whosevigorousgov-\nernmentwillsuffernostrangerstopossessanyfortifiedplacewithintheir\nterritory, it may be necessary to maintain some ambassador, minister, or\ncounsel, who may both decide, according to their own customs, the differ-\nences arising among his own countrymen, and, in their disputes with the\nnatives,may,bymeansofhispubliccharacter,interferewithmoreauthor-\nity, and afford them a more powerful protection, than they could expect\nfromanyprivateman. Theinterestsofcommercehavefrequentlymadeit\nnecessary to maintain ministers in foreign countries where the purposes,\neither of war or alliance, would not have required any. The commerce of\ntheTurkeyCompanyfirstoccasionedtheestablishmentofanordinaryam-\nbassador at Constantinople. The first English embassies to Russia arose\naltogether from commercial interests. The constant interference which\nthose interests necessarily occasioned between the subjects of the differ-\nent states of Europe, has probably introduced the custom of keeping, in\nall neighbouring countries, ambassadors or ministers constantly resident\neven in the time of peace. This custom, unknown to ancient times, seems\nnot to be older than the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth\ncentury;thatis,thanthetimewhencommercefirstbegantoextenditself\nto the greater part of the nations of Europe, and when they first began to\nattendtoitsinterests.\n1599 [3] It seems not unreasonable that the extraordinary expense which the\nprotection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion should be\ndefrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate\nfine,forexample,tobepaidbythetraderswhentheyfirstenterintoit,or,\nwhatismoreequal,byaparticulardutyofsomuchpercentuponthegoods\nwhich they either import into, or export out of, the particular countries\nwithwhichitiscarriedon. Theprotectionoftradeingeneral,frompirates\nandfreebooters,issaidtohavegivenoccasiontothefirstinstitutionofthe\nduties of customs. But, if it was thought reasonable to lay a general tax\nupon trade, in order to defray the expense of protecting trade in general,\nitshouldseemequallyreasonabletolayaparticulartaxuponaparticular\n567", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbranchoftrade,inordertodefraytheextraordinaryexpenseofprotecting\nthatbranch.\n1600 [4] Theprotectionoftradeingeneralhasalwaysbeenconsideredasessen- G.ed.p733\ntialtothedefenceofthecommonwealth, and, uponthataccount, aneces-\nsarypartofthedutyoftheexecutivepower. Thecollectionandapplication\nof the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been left to that\npower. Buttheprotectionofanyparticularbranchoftradeisapartofthe\ngeneral protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the duty of that power;\nand if nations always acted consistently, the particular duties levied for\nthe purposes of such particular protection should always have been left\nequally to its disposal. But in this respect, as well as in many others, na-\ntions have not always acted consistently; and in the greater part of the\ncommercialstatesofEurope,particularcompaniesofmerchantshavehad\ntheaddresstopersuadethelegislaturetoentrusttothemtheperformance\nofthispartofthedutyofthesovereign,togetherwithallthepowerswhich\narenecessarilyconnectedwithit.\n1601 [5] These companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the\nfirst introduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own\nexpense, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to\nmake,haveinthelongrunproved,universally,eitherburdensomeoruse-\nless,andhaveeithermismanagedorconfinedthetrade.\n1602 [6] Whenthosecompaniesdonottradeuponajointstock, butareobliged\nto admit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and\nagreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member trad-\ning upon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called regulated\ncompanies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member sharing in\nthecommonprofitorlossinproportiontohisshareinthisstock,theyare\ncalled joint stock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or joint\nstock,sometimeshave,andsometimeshavenot,exclusiveprivileges.\n1603 [7] Regulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporations of\ntrades so common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of\nEurope, and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind. As no\ninhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade without first ob-\ntaining his freedom in the corporation, so in most cases no subject of the\nstate can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which a reg-\nulated company is established, without first becoming a member of that\ncompany. The monopoly is more or less strict according as the terms of\nadmission are more or less difficult; and according as the directors of the\ncompanyhavemoreorlessauthority,orhaveitmoreorlessintheirpower G.ed.p734\nto manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the trade\nto themselves and their particular friends. In the most ancient regulated\ncompanies the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in other cor-\nporations, and entitled the person who had served his time to a member\nof the company to become himself a member, either without paying any\nfine, or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other\n568", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\npeople. The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain\nit, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to\nactaccordingtotheirnaturalgenius,theyhavealways,inordertoconfine\nthe competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured\nto subject the trade to many burden some regulations. When the law has\nrestrainedthemfromdoingthis,theyhavebecomealtogetheruselessand\ninsignificant.\n1604 [8] The regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present sub-\nsistinGreatBritainaretheancientmerchantadventurers\u2019company,now\ncommonly called the Hamburg Company, the Russia Company, the East-\nlandCompany,theTurkeyCompany,andtheAfricanCompany.\n1605 [9] ThetermsofadmissionintotheHamburgCompanyarenowsaidtobe\nquite easy, and the directors either have it not their power to subject the\ntrade to any burdensome restraint or regulations, or, at least, have not of\nlate exercised that power. It has not always been so. About the middle of\nthelastcentury,thefineforadmissionwasfifty,andatonetimeonehun-\ndredpounds,andtheconductofthecompanywassaidtobeextremelyop-\npressive. In1643,in1645,andin1661,theclothiersandfreetradersofthe\nWestofEnglandcomplainedofthemtoParliamentasofmonopolistswho\nconfinedthetradeandoppressedthemanufacturesofthecountry. Though\nthosecomplaintsproducedanActofParliament,theyhadprobablyintim-\nidatedthecompanysofarastoobligethemtoreformtheirconduct. Since\nthattime,atleast,therehasbeennocomplaintsagainstthem. Bythe10th\nand 11th of William III. c.6, the fine for admission into the Russia Com-\npany was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of Charles II. c.7, that G.ed.p735\nfor admission into the Eastland Company to forty shillings, while, at the\nsametime,Sweden,Denmark,andNorway,allthecountriesonthenorth\nsideoftheBaltic,wereexemptedfromtheirexclusivecharter.

Before that time, Sir Josiah Child had represented both these and\ntheHamburgCompanyasextremelyoppressive,andimputedtotheirbad\nmanagementthelowstateofthetradewhichweatthattimecarriedonto\nthe countries comprehended within their respective charters. But though\nsuchcompaniesmaynot,inthepresenttimes,beveryoppressive,theyare\ncertainly altogether useless. To be merely useless, indeed, is perhaps the\nhighest eulogy which can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated com-\npany;andallthethreecompaniesabovementionedseem,intheirpresent\nstate,todeservethiseulogy.\n1606 [10] ThefineforadmissionintotheTurkeyCompanywasformerlytwenty-\nfivepoundsforallpersonsundertwenty-sixyearsofage,andfiftypounds\nfor all persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be ad-\nmitted; a restriction which excluded all shopkeepers and retailers. By a\nbye-law, no British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but in the\ngeneral ships of the company; and as those ships sailed always from the\nport of London, this restriction confined the trade to that expensive port,\n569", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nandthetraderstothosewholivedinLondonandinitsneighbourhood. By\nanother bye-law, no person living within twenty miles of London, and not\nfree of the city, could be admitted a member; another restriction which,\njoined to the foregoing, necessarily excluded all but the freemen of Lon-\ndon. As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships de-\npendedaltogetheruponthedirectors,theycouldeasilyfillthemwiththeir\nown goods and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion of oth-\ners, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In this\nstate of things, therefore, this company was in every respect a strict and\noppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of the 26th of\nGeorge II, c. 18, reducing the fine for admission to twenty pounds for all\npersons,withoutanydistinctionofages,oranyrestriction,eithertomere\nmerchants, or to the freemen of London; and granting to all such persons\nthe liberty of exporting, from all the ports of Great Britain to any port\nin Turkey, all British goods of which the exportation was not prohibited;\nand of importing from thence all Turkish goods of which the importation\nwas not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of customs, and\ntheparticulardutiesassessedfordefrayingthenecessaryexpensesofthe G.ed.p736\ncompany;andsubmitting,atthesametime,tothelawfulauthorityofthe\nBritishambassadorandconsulsresidentinTurkey,andtothebyelawsof\nthecompanydulyenacted. Topreventanyoppressionbythosebye-laws,it\nwas by the same act ordained, that if any seven members of the company\nconceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should be enacted\nafter the passing of this act, they might appeal to the Board of Trade and\nPlantations(totheauthorityofwhichacommitteeofthePrivyCouncilhas\nnow succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within twelve months\nafter the bye-law was enacted; and that if any seven members conceived\nthemselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been enacted before the\npassing of this act, they might bring a like appeal, provided it was within\ntwelvemonthsafterthedayonwhichthisactwastotakeplace. Theexper-\nience of one year, however, may not always be sufficient to discover to all\nthe members of a great company, the pernicious tendency of a particular\nbye-law; and if several of them should afterwards discover it, neither the\nBoardofTrade,northecommitteeofcouncil,canaffordthemanyredress.\nTheobject,besides,ofthegreaterpartofthebye-lawsofallregulatedcom-\npanies,aswellasofallothercorporations,isnotsomuchtooppressthose\nwhoarealreadymembers,astodiscourageothersfrombecomingso;which\nmaybedone,notonlybyahighfine,butbymanyothercontrivances. The\nconstant view of such companies is always to raise the rate of their own\nprofit as high as they can; to keep the market, both for the goods which\nthey export, and for those which they import, as much understocked as\nthey can: which can be done only by restraining the competition, or by\ndiscouraging new adventurers from entering into the trade. A fine even\nof twenty pounds, besides, though it may not perhaps be sufficient to dis-\ncourageanymanfromenteringintotheTurkeytradewithanintentionto\n570", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncontinue in it, may be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from\nhazarding a single adventure in it. In all trades, the regular established\ntraders, even though not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits,\nwhich are noway so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper\nlevel, as by the occasional competition of speculative adventure. The Tur-\nkey trade, though in some measure laid open by this Act of Parliament,\nis still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free.\nThe Turkey Company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or\nthreeconsuls,who,likeotherpublicministers,oughttobemaintainedal-\ntogetherbythestate,andthetradelaidopentoallhisMajesty\u2019ssubjects.\nThe different taxes levied by the company, for this and other corporation\npurposes, might afford avenue much more than sufficient to enable the\nstatetomaintainsuchministers.\n1607 [11] Regulatedcompanies,itwasobservedbySirJosiahChild,thoughthey G.ed.p737\nhadfrequentlysupportedpublicministers,hadnevermaintainedanyforts\norgarrisonsinthecountriestowhichtheytraded;whereasjointstockcom-\npaniesfrequentlyhad.

Theyaremorelikely,therefore,tohavethat\ncontinual and careful attention which that maintenance necessarily re-\nquires. Secondly, the directors of a joint stock company have always the\nmanagement of a large capital, the joint stock of the company, a part of\nwhich they may frequently employ, with propriety, in building, repairing,\nandmaintainingsuchnecessaryfortsandgarrisons. Butthedirectorsofa\nregulatedcompany,havingthemanagementofnocommoncapital,haveno\nother fund to employ in this way but the casual revenue arising from the\nadmission fines, and from the corporation duties imposed upon the trade\nof the company.

The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate ca-\npacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon common seal,\nor from laying any restraints upon the trade which may be carried on\nfreely from all places, and by all persons being British subjects, and pay-\ning the fine. The government is in a committee of nine persons who meet\nat London, but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company\nat London, Bristol, and Liverpool; three from each place.

The company had been suspected of re-\nstraining the trade, and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly.\nIt is not, however, very easy to conceive how, under the regulations of the\n23rdofGeorgeII,theycoulddoso.

But Parliament, which\ngives so little attention to the application of millions, is not likely to give\nmuchtothatof13,000l.ayear;andtheCursitorBaronofExchequer,from\nhis profession and education, is not likely to be profoundly skilled in the\nproper expense of forts and garrisons. The captains of his Majesty\u2019s navy,\nindeed, or any other commissioned officers appointed by the Board of Ad-\nmiralty, may inquire into the condition of the forts and garrisons, and re-\nport their observations to that board.

The committee are accused of having sent out bricks\nand stones from England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle on the\ncoast of Guinea, a business for which Parliament had several times gran-\nted an extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones too, which\nhadthusbeensentuponsolongavoyage,weresaidtohavebeenofsobad\na quality that it was necessary to rebuild from the foundation the walls\nwhich had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie\nnorth of Cape Rouge are not only maintained at the expense of the state,\nbutareundertheimmediategovernmentoftheexecutivepower;andwhy\nthose which lie south of that Cape, and which are, in part at least, main-\ntainedattheexpenseofthestate,shouldbeunderadifferentgovernment,\nit seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason.

In the extent of its dominion\nconsists, in a great measure, the pride and dignity of that power; and it\nis not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary for the defence\n573", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof that dominion. The garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca, accordingly,\nhave never been neglected; though Minorca has been twice taken, and is\nnow probably lost for ever, that disaster was never even imputed to any\nneglect in the executive power. I would not, however, be understood to\ninsinuate that either of those expensive garrisons was ever, even in the\nsmallest degree, necessary for the purpose for which they were originally\ndismemberedfromtheSpanishmonarchy.

Eachmember,however,may,uponproperwarn-\ning,withdrawfromthecopartnery,anddemandpaymentfromthemofhis\nshare of the common stock. In a joint stock company, on the contrary, no\nmember can demand payment of his share from the company; but each\nmember can, without their consent, transfer his share to another person,\nandtherebyintroduceanewmember. Thevalueofashareinajointstock\nis always the price which it will bring in the market; and this may be\neither greater or less, in any proportion, than the sum which its owner\nstandscreditedforinthestockofthecompany.\n1613 [17] Secondly, in a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts\ncontracted by the company to the whole extent of his fortune. In a joint\nstockcompany,onthecontrary,eachpartnerisboundonlytotheextentof G.ed.p741\nhisshare.\n1614 [18] Thetradeofajointstockcompanyisalwaysmanagedbyacourtofdir-\nectors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to the\ncontrolofageneralcourtofproprietors. Butthegreaterpartofthosepro-\nprietorsseldompretendtounderstandanythingofthebusinessofthecom-\npany, and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them,\ngive themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly such half-\nyearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them.\nThistotalexemptionfromtroubleandfromrisk,beyondalimitedsum,en-\ncouragesmanypeopletobecomeadventurersinjointstockcompanies,who\nwould, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery.\nSuch companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves much greater\nstocks than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading stock of the\nSouthSeaCompany,atonetime,amountedtoupwardsofthirty-threemil-\nlions eight hundred thousand pounds. The divided capital of the Bank of\nEngland amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty\nthousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however, being the\n574", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmanagersratherofotherpeople\u2019smoneythanoftheirown, itcannotwell\nbe expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigil-\nance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch\nover their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider\nattentiontosmallmattersasnotfortheirmaster\u2019shonour,andveryeasily\ngive themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion,\ntherefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the\naffairs of such a company. It is upon this account that joint stock com-\npanies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competi-\ntionagainstprivateadventurers. Theyhave,accordingly,veryseldomsuc-\nceeded without an exclusive privilege, and frequently have not succeeded\nwith one. Without an exclusive privilege they have commonly misman-\naged the trade. With an exclusive privilege they have both mismanaged\nandconfinedit.\n1615 [19] The Royal African Company, the predecessors of the present African\nCompany, had an exclusive privilege by charter, but as that charter had G.ed.p742\nnot been confirmed by Act of Parliament, the trade, in consequence of\nthe Declaration of Rights, was, soon after the revolution, laid open to all\nhis Majesty\u2019s subjects. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company are, as to their legal\nrights, in the same situation as the Royal African Company. Their ex-\nclusive charter has not been confirmed by Act of Parliament. The South\nSea Company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an\nexclusive privilege confirmed by Act of Parliament; as have likewise the\npresentUnitedCompanyofMerchantstradingtotheEastIndies.\n1616 [20] The Royal African Company soon found that they could not maintain\nthe competition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the\nDeclaration of Rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers,\nandtopersecuteassuch. In1698, however, theprivateadventurerswere\nsubjected to a duty of ten per cent upon almost all the different branches\noftheirtrade,tobeemployedbythecompanyinthemaintenanceoftheir\nfortsandgarrisonsBut,notwithstandingthisheavytax,thecompanywere\nstillunabletomaintainthecompetition. Theirstockandcreditgradually\ndeclined. In 1712, their debts had become so great that a particular Act\nof Parliament was thought necessary, both for their security and for that\noftheircreditors. Itwasenactedthattheresolutionoftwo-thirdsofthese\ncreditors in number and value should bind the rest, both with regard to\nthetimewhichshouldbeallowedtothecompanyforthepaymentoftheir G.ed.p743\ndebts, and with regard to any other agreement which it might be thought\nproper to make with them concerning those debts. In 1730, their affairs\nwereinsogreatdisorderthattheywerealtogetherincapableofmaintain-\ning their forts and garrisons, the sole purpose and pretext of their insti-\ntution. From that year, till their final dissolution, the Parliament judged\nitnecessarytoallowtheannualsumoftenthousandpoundsforthatpur-\npose. In 1732, after having been for many years losers by the trade of\ncarrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last resolved to give it up al-\n575", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntogether; to sell to the private traders to America the negroes which they\npurchased upon the coast; and to employ their servants in a trade to the\ninland parts of Africa for gold dust, elephants\u2019 teeth, dyeing drugs, etc.\nButtheirsuccessinthismoreconfinedtradewasnotgreaterthanintheir\nformerextensiveone. Theiraffairscontinuedtogograduallytodecline,till\natlast,beingineveryrespectabankruptcompany,theyweredissolvedby\nActofParliament,andtheirfortsandgarrisonsvestedinthepresentreg-\nulatedcompanyofmerchantstradingtoAfrica. Beforetheerectionofthe\nRoyal African Company, there had been three other joint stock compan-\niessuccessivelyestablished,oneafteranother,fortheAfricantrade. They\nwere all equally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive charters,\nwhich,thoughnotconfirmedbyActofParliament,wereinthosedayssup-\nposedtoconveyarealexclusiveprivilege.\n1617 [21] The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, before their misfortunes in the late war,\nhad been much more fortunate than the Royal African Company. Their\nnecessary expense is much smaller. The whole number of people whom\nthey maintain in their different settlements and habitations, which they\nhavehonouredwiththenameofforts,issaidnottoexceedahundredand\ntwentypersons. Thisnumber,however,issufficienttopreparebeforehand\nthecargooffursandothergoodsnecessaryforloadingtheirships,which,\nonaccountoftheice,canseldomremainabovesixoreightweeksinthose\nseas. This advantage of having a cargo ready prepared could not for sev-\neralyearsbeacquiredbyprivateadventurers,andwithoutitthereseems\ntobenopossibilityoftradingtoHudson\u2019sBay. Themoderatecapitalofthe\ncompany,which,itissaid,doesnotexceedonehundredandtenthousand\npounds, may besides be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole, or G.ed.p744\nalmost the whole, trade and surplus produce of the miserable, though ex-\ntensivecountry,comprehendedwithintheircharter. Noprivateadventur-\ners, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in competi-\ntionwiththem. Thiscompany,therefore,havealwaysenjoyedanexclusive\ntrade in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over and above\nallthis,themoderatecapitalofthiscompanyissaidtobedividedamonga\nverysmallnumberofproprietors. Butajointstockcompany,consistingof\na small number of proprietors, with a moderate capital, approaches very\nnearlytothenatureofaprivatecopartnery,andmaybecapableofnearly\nthe same degree of vigilance and attention. It is not to be wondered at,\ntherefore, if, in consequence of these different advantages, the Hudson\u2019s\nBay Company had, before the late war, been able to carry on their trade\nwithaconsiderabledegreeofsuccess. Itdoesnotseemprobable,however,\nthat their profits ever approached to what the late Mr. Dobbs imagined\nthem. A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr. Anderson, author of\nThe Historical and Chronological Deduction of Commerce, very justly ob-\nservesthat,uponexaminingtheaccountsofwhichMr.Dobbshimselfwas\ngiven for several years together of their exports and imports, and upon\nmakingproperallowancesfortheirextraordinaryriskandexpense,itdoes\n576", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nnot appear that their profits deserve to be envied, or that they can much,\nifatall,exceedtheordinaryprofitsoftrade.\n1618 [22] TheSouthSeaCompanyneverhadanyfortsorgarrisonstomaintain,\nand therefore were entirely exempted from one great expense to which\notherjointstockcompaniesforforeigntradearesubject.

Itwas G.ed.p745\nnaturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and profusion\nshouldprevailinthewholemanagementoftheiraffairs. Theknaveryand\nextravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently known, and\ntheexplicationofthemwouldbeforeigntothepresentsubject. Theirmer-\ncantileprojectswerenotmuchbetterconducted. Thefirsttradewhichthey\nengagedinwasthatofsupplyingtheSpanishWestIndieswithnegroes,of\nwhich (in consequence of what was called the Assiento contract granted\nthem by the Treaty of Utrecht) they had the exclusive privilege. But as\nit was not expected that much profit could be made by this trade, both\nthePortugueseandFrenchcompanies, whohadenjoyedituponthesame\nterms before them, having been ruined by it, they were allowed, as com-\npensation, to send annually a ship of a certain burden to trade directly to\nthe Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages which this annual ship was\nallowedtomake,theyaresaidtohavegainedconsiderablybyone,thatof\ntheRoyalCarolinein1731,andtohavebeenlosers,moreorless,byalmost\nall the rest.

Of this, in-\ndeed, they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other\nBritish subjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which\ntheirshipsmadetoGreenland,theyweregainersbyone,andlosersbyall\ntherest. Aftertheireighthandlastvoyage,whentheyhadsoldtheirships,\nstores, and utensils, they found that their whole loss, upon this branch,\ncapital and interest included, amounted to upwards of two hundred and\nthirty-seventhousandpounds.\n1620 [24] In 1722, this company petitioned the Parliament to be allowed to di-\nvide their immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hun-\ndred thousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government,\ninto two equal parts: The one half, or upwards of sixteen millions nine\nhundredthousandpounds,tobeputuponthesamefootingwithothergov- G.ed.p746\nernmentannuities,andnottobesubjecttothedebtscontracted,orlosses\nincurred, by the directors of the company in the prosecution of their mer-\ncantileprojects;theotherhalftoremain,asbefore,atradingstock,andto\n577", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nbe subject to those debts and losses. The petition was too reasonable not\nto be granted. In 1733, they again petitioned the Parliament that three-\nfourthsoftheirtradingstockmightbeturnedintoannuitystock,andonly\none-fourthremainastradingstock,orexposedtothehazardsarisingfrom\nthe bad management of their directors. Both their annuity and trading\nstockshad,bythistime,beenreducedmorethantwomillionseachbysev-\neral different payments from government; so that this fourth amounted\nonlyto3,662,784l.8s.6d.In1748,allthedemandsofthecompanyuponthe\nKingofSpain,inconsequenceoftheAssientocontract,were,bytheTreaty\nofAix-la-Chapelle,givenupforwhatwassupposedanequivalent. Anend\nwasputtotheirtradewiththeSpanishWestIndies,theremainderoftheir\ntrading stock was turned into an annuity stock, and the company ceased\nineveryrespecttobeatradingcompany.\n1621 [25] It ought to be observed that in the trade which the South Sea Com-\npany carried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by which\nit ever was expected that they could make any considerable profit, they\nwerenotwithoutcompetitors,eitherintheforeignorinthehomemarket.\nAt Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the\ncompetition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from Cadiz, to those\nmarkets,Europeangoodsofthesamekindwiththeoutwardcargooftheir\nship;andinEnglandtheyhadtoencounterthatoftheEnglishmerchants,\nwho imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish West Indies of the same\nkind with the inward cargo. The goods both of the Spanish and English\nmerchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to higher duties. But the loss\noccasioned by the negligence, profusion, and malversation of the servants\nof the company had probably been a tax much heavier than all those du-\nties. Thatajointstockcompanyshouldbeabletocarryonsuccessfullyany\nbranch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any sort\nofopenandfaircompetitionwiththem,seemscontrarytoallexperience.\n1622 [26] The old English East India Company was established in 1600 by a\ncharterfromQueenElizabeth. Inthefirsttwelvevoyageswhichtheyfitted G.ed.p747\noutforIndia,theyappeartohavetradedasaregulatedcompany,withsep-\naratestocks,thoughonlyinthegeneralshipsofthecompany. In1612,they\nunitedintoajointstock. Theircharterwasexclusive,andthoughnotcon-\nfirmed by Act of Parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a real\nexclusive privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much dis-\nturbedbyinterlopers. Theircapital,whichneverexceededsevenhundred\nand forty-four thousand pounds, and of which fifty pounds was a share,\nwas not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so extensive, as to afford either\napretextforgrossnegligenceandprofusion,oracovertogrossmalversa-\ntion. Notwithstandingsomeextraordinarylosses,occasionedpartlybythe\nmalice of the Dutch East India Company, and partly by other accidents,\nthey carried on for many years a successful trade. But in process of time,\nwhentheprinciplesoflibertywerebetterunderstood,itbecameeveryday\nmore and more doubtful how far a Royal Charter, not confirmed by Act of\n578", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nParliament, could convey an exclusive privilege. Upon this question the\ndecisions of the courts of justice were not uniform, but varied with the\nauthorityofgovernmentandthehumoursofthetimes. Interlopersmulti-\nplied upon them, and towards the end of the reign of Charles II, through\nthe whole of that of James II and during a part of that of William III, re-\nducedthemtogreatdistress. In1698,aproposalwasmadetoParliament\nof advancing two millions to government at eight per cent, provided the\nsubscribers were erected into a new East India Company with exclusive\nprivileges. The old East India Company offered seven hundred thousand\npounds,nearlytheamountoftheircapital,atfourpercentuponthesame\nconditions. Butsuchwasatthattimethestateofpubliccredit,thatitwas\nmore convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight per cent\nthan seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The proposal of the new\nsubscribers was accepted, and a new East India Company established in\nconsequence. The old East India Company, however, had a right to con-\ntinue their trade till 1701. They had, at the same time, in the name of\ntheir treasurer, subscribed, very artfully, three hundred and fifteen thou-\nsandpoundsintothestockofthenew. Byanegligenceintheexpressionof\ntheActofParliamentwhichvestedtheEastIndiatradeinthesubscribers\nto this loan of two millions, it did not appear evident that they were all G.ed.p748\nobliged to unite into a joint stock. A few private traders, whose subscrip-\ntionsamountedonlytoseventhousandtwohundredpounds,insistedupon\ntheprivilegeoftradingseparatelyupontheirownstocksandattheirown\nrisk. The old East India Company had a right to a separate trade upon\ntheiroldstocktill1701; andtheyhadlikewise, bothbeforeandafterthat\nperiod,aright,likethatofotherprivatetraders,toaseparatetradeupon\nthethreehundredandfifteenthousandpoundswhichtheyhadsubscribed\ninto the stock of the new company. The competition of the two companies\nwith the private traders, and with one another, is said to have well-nigh\nruined both. Upon a subsequent occasion, in 1730, when a proposal was\nmadetoParliamentforputtingthetradeunderthemanagementofaregu-\nlatedcompany,andtherebylayingitinsomemeasureopen,theEastIndia\nCompany, inoppositiontothisproposal, representedinverystrongterms\nwhat had been, at this time, the miserable effects, as they thought them,\nofthiscompetition. InIndia,theysaid,itraisedthepriceofgoodssohigh\nthattheywerenotworththebuying;andinEngland,byoverstockingthe\nmarket, it sunk their price so low that no profit could be made by them.\nThat by a more plentiful supply, to the great advantage and conveniency\nofthepublic,itmusthavereduced,verymuch,thepriceofIndiangoodsin\ntheEnglishmarket,cannotwellbedoubted;butthatitshouldhaveraised\nvery much their price in the Indian market seems not very probable, as\nalltheextraordinarydemandwhichthatcompetitioncouldoccasionmust\nhave been but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian Com-\nmerce. The increase of demand, besides, though in the beginning it may\nsometimesraisethepriceofgoods,neverfailstoloweritintherun. Iten-\n579", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncourages production, and thereby increases the competition of the produ-\ncers,who,inordertounderselloneanother,haverecoursetonewdivisions\noflabourandnewimprovementsofartwhichmightneverotherwisehave\nbeen thought of. The miserable effects of which the company complained\nwere the cheapness of consumption and the encouragement given to pro-\nduction,preciselythetwoeffectswhichitisthegreatbusinessofpolitical\neconomy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave this\ndoleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In 1702,\nthetwocompanieswere,insomemeasure,unitedbyanindenturetripart-\nite,towhichthequeenwasthethirdparty;andin1708,theywere,byact\nof parliament, perfectly consolidated into one company by their present G.ed.p749\nnameoftheTheUnitedCompanyofMerchantstradingtotheEastIndies.\nInto this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause allowing the\nseparate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas 1711, but at the\nsame time empowering the directors, upon three years\u2019 notice, to redeem\ntheir little capital of seven thousand two hundred pounds, and thereby to\nconvertthewholestockofthecompanyintoajointstock. Bythesameact,\nthe capital of the company, in consequence of a new loan to government,\nwasaugmentedfromtwomillionstothreemillionstwohundredthousand\npounds. In 1743, the company advanced another million to government.\nBut this million being raised, not by a call upon the proprietors, but by\nsellingannuitiesandcontractingbond-debts,itdidnotaugmentthestock\nuponwhichtheproprietorscouldclaimadividend. Itaugmented,however,\ntheirtradingstock,itbeingequallyliablewiththeotherthreemillionstwo\nhundredthousandpoundstothelossessustained,anddebtscontracted,by\nthe company in prosecution of their mercantile projects. From 1708, or at\nleast from 1711, this company, being delivered from all competitors, and\nfullyestablishedinthemonopolyoftheEnglishcommercetotheEastIn-\ndies, carried on a successful trade, and from their profits made annually\na moderate dividend to their proprietors. During the French war, which\nbegan in 1741, the ambition of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pon-\ndicherry, involved them in the wars of the Carnatic, and in the politics of\ntheIndianprinces. Aftermanysignalsuccesses,andequallysignallosses,\nthey at last lost Madras, at that time their principal settlement in India.\nIt was restored to them by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and about this\ntimethespiritofwarandconquestseemstohavetakenpossessionoftheir\nservants in India, and never since to have left them. During the French\nwar, which began in 1755, their arms partook of the general good fortune\nof those of Great Britain. They defended Madras, took Pondicherry, re-\ncoveredCalcutta,andacquiredtherevenuesofarichandextensiveterrit-\nory,amounting,itwasthensaid,toupwardsofthreemillionsayear. They\nremainedforseveralyearsinquietpossessionofthisrevenue: butin1767,\nadministrationlaidclaimtotheirterritorialacquisitions,andtherevenue\narising from them, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company,\nin compensation for this claim, agreed to pay the government four hun-\n580", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndred thousand pounds a year. They had before this gradually augmented\ntheir dividend from about six to ten per cent; that is, upon their capital G.ed.p750\nof three millions two hundred thousand pounds they had increased it by\na hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds, or had raised it from one\nhundredandninety-twothousandtothreehundredandtwentythousand\npounds a year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still fur-\nther, to twelve and a half per cent, which would have made their annual\npayments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay an-\nnually to government, or to four hundred thousand pounds a year. But\nduring the two years in which their agreement with government was to\ntake place, they were restrained from any further increase of dividend by\ntwosuccessiveActsofParliament,ofwhichtheobjectwastoenablethem\nto make a speedier progress in the payment of their debts, which were\nat this time estimated at upwards of six or seven millions sterling. In\n1769,theyrenewedtheiragreementwithgovernmentforfiveyearsmore,\nand stipulated that during the course of that period they should be al-\nlowed gradually to increase their dividend to twelve and a half per cent;\nnever increasing it, however, more than one per cent in one year. This in-\ncreaseofdividend,therefore,whenithadrisentoitsutmostheight,could\naugment their annual payments, to their proprietors and government to-\ngether, but by six hundred and eight thousand pounds beyond what they\nhadbeenbeforetheirlateterritorialacquisitions. Whatthegrossrevenue\nof those territorial acquisitions was supposed to amount to has already\nbeenmentioned;andbyanaccountbroughtbytheCruttendenEastIndia-\nmanin1768,thenetrevenue,clearofalldeductionsandmilitarycharges,\nwas stated at two millions forty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-\nseven pounds. They were said at the same time to possess another rev-\nenue, arising partly from lands, but chiefly from the customs established\nat their different settlements, amounting to four hundred and thirty-nine\nthousand pounds. The profits of their trade too, according to the evid-\nence of their chairman before the House of Commons, amounted at this\ntime to at least four hundred thousand pounds a year, according to that\nof their accountant, to at least five hundred thousand; according to the\nlowest account, at least equal to the highest dividend that was to be paid\nto their proprietors. So great a revenue might certainly have afforded an\naugmentation of six hundred and eight thousand pounds in their annual\npayments, and at the same time have left a large sinking fund sufficient\nfor the speedy reduction of their debts. In 1773, however, their debts, in-\nsteadofbeingreduced,wereaugmentedbyanarreartothetreasuryinthe\npayment of the four hundred thousand pounds, by another to the custom-\nhouse for duties unpaid, by a large debt to the bank for money borrowed,\nand by a fourth for bills drawn upon them from India, and wantonly ac- G.ed.p751\ncepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand pounds.\nThe distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them, obliged\nthem not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per cent, but to\n581", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthrow themselves upon the mercy of government, and to supplicate, first,\na release from further payment of the stipulated four hundred thousand\npoundsayear;and,secondly,aloanoffourteenhundredthousand,tosave\nthemfromimmediatebankruptcy. Thegreatincreaseoftheirfortunehad,\nit seems, only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for greater\nprofusion, and a cover for greater malversation, than in proportion even\nto that increase of fortune. The conduct of their servants in India, and\nthe general state of their affairs both in India and in Europe, became the\nsubject of a Parliamentary inquiry, in consequence of which several very\nimportantalternationsweremadeintheconstitutionoftheirgovernment,\nboth at home and abroad. In India their principal settlements of Madras,\nBombay, and Calcutta, which had before been altogether independent of\noneanother,weresubjectedtoagovernor-general,assistedbyacouncilof\nfour assessors, Parliament assuming to itself the first nomination of this\ngovernorandcouncilwhoweretoresideatCalcutta;thatcityhavingnow\nbecome,whatMadraswasbefore,themostimportantoftheEnglishsettle-\nments in India. The Court of the Mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted\nfor the trial of mercantile causes which arose in city and neighbourhood,\nhad gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire.\nItwasnowreducedandconfinedtotheoriginalpurposeofitsinstitution.\nInsteadofitanewsupremecourtofjudicaturewasestablished,consisting\nofachiefjusticeandthreejudgestobeappointedbythecrown. InEurope,\nthe qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to vote at their general\ncourts was raised from five hundred pounds, the original price of a share G.ed.p752\nin the stock of the company, to a thousand pounds. In order to vote upon\nthis qualification too, it was declared necessary that he should have pos-\nsessed it, if acquired by his own purchase, and not by inheritance, for at\nleast one year, instead of six months, the term requisite before. The court\nof twenty-four directors had before been chosen annually; but it was now\nenactedthateachdirectorshould,forthefuture,bechosenforfouryears;\nsix of them, however, to go out of office by rotation every year, and not to\nbecapableofbeingre-chosenattheelectionofthesixnewdirectorsforthe\nensuing year. In consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the\nproprietorsanddirectors,itwasexpected,wouldbelikelytoactwithmore\ndignity and steadiness than they had usually done before. But it seems\nimpossible, by any alterations, to render those courts, in any respect, fit\nto govern, or even to share in the government of a great empire; because\nthe greater part of their members must always have too little interest in\nthe prosperity of that empire to give any serious attention to what may\npromote it. Frequently a man of great, sometimes even a man of small\nfortune, is willing to purchase a thousand pounds\u2019 share in India stock\nmerelyfortheinfluencewhichheexpectstoacquirebyavoteinthecourt\nof proprietors. It gives him a share, though not in the plunder, yet in the\nappointmentoftheplunderersofIndia;thecourtofdirectors,thoughthey\nmakethatappointment,beingnecessarilymoreorlessundertheinfluence\n582", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof the proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but sometimes over-\nrule the appointments of their servants in India. Provided he can enjoy\nthis influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a certain number\nof his friends, he frequently cares little about the dividend, or even about\nthe value of the stock upon which his vote is founded. About the prosper-\nity of the great empire, in the government of which that vote gives him a\nshare, he seldom cares at all. No other sovereigns ever were, or, from the\nnatureofthings,evercouldbe,soperfectlyindifferentaboutthehappiness\nor misery of their subjects, the improvement or waste of their dominions,\nthe glory or disgrace of their administration, as, from irresistible moral\ncauses, the greater part of the proprietors of such a mercantile company\nare, and necessarily must be. This indifference, too, was more likely to\nbe increased than diminished by some of the new regulations which were\nmade in consequence of the Parliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the\nHouse of Commons, for example, it was declared, that when the fourteen\nhundred thousand pounds lent to the company by government should be\npaid,andtheirbond-debtsbereducedtofifteenhundredthousandpounds,\ntheymightthen,andnottillthen,divideeightpercentupontheircapital;\nand that whatever remained of their revenues and net profits at home G.ed.p753\nshould be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the ex-\nchequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a fund\neitherforthefurtherreductionoftheirbond-debts,orforthedischargeof\nother contingent exigencies which the company might labour under. But\nif the company were bad stewards, and bad sovereigns, when the whole\noftheirnetrevenueandprofitsbelongedtothemselves,andwereattheir\nown disposal, they were surely not likely to be better when three-fourths\nofthemweretobelongtootherpeople, andtheotherfourth, thoughtobe\nlaid out for the benefit of the company, yet to be so under the inspection\nandwiththeapprobationofotherpeople.\n1623 [27] It might be more agreeable to the company that their own servants\nand dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting or the profit\nof embezzling whatever surplus might remain after paying the proposed\ndividendofeightpercentthanthatitshouldcomeintothehandsofaset\nofpeoplewithwhomthoseresolutionscouldscarcefailtosetthem,insome\nmeasure,atvariance. Theinterestofthoseservantsanddependantsmight\nsofarpredominateinthecourtofproprietorsassometimestodisposeitto\nsupport the authors of depredations which had been committed in direct\nviolationofitsownauthority. Withthemajorityofproprietors,thesupport\neven of the authority of their own court might sometimes be a matter of\nless consequence than the support of those who had set that authority at\ndefiance.\n1624 [28] The regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the dis-\norders of the company\u2019s government in India. Notwithstanding that, dur-\ning a momentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected into\nthe treasury of Calcutta more than three millions sterling; notwithstand-\n583", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ningthattheyhadafterwardsextended,eithertheirdominion,ortheirde-\npredations, over a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile\ncountries in India, all was wasted and destroyed. They found themselves\naltogether unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of Hyder Ali; and,\nin consequence of those disorders, the company is now (1784) in greater\ndistressthanever;and,inordertopreventimmediatebankruptcy,isonce\nmore reduced to supplicate the assistance of government. Different plans\nhave been proposed by the different parties in Parliament for the better\nmanagementofitsaffairs. Andallthoseplansseemtoagreeinsupposing,\nwhat was indeed always abundantly evident, that it is altogether unfit to\ngovernitsterritorialpossessions.

Thejointstockcompanieswhichhavehadtheoneright\nhave constantly exercised the other, and have frequently had it expressly\nconferred upon them. How unjustly, how capriciously, how cruelly they\nhavecommonlyexercisedit,istoowellknownfromrecentexperience.\n1626 [30] When a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and ex-\npense,toestablishanewtradewithsomeremoteandbarbarousnation,it\nmay not be unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint stock company,\nand to grant them, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade for a\ncertain number of years. It is the easiest and most natural way in which\nthe state can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive\nexperiment, of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A tem-\nporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the same principles\nupon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor,\nandthatofanewbooktoitsauthor. Butupontheexpirationoftheterm, G.ed.p755\nthe monopoly ought certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it\nwasfoundnecessarytoestablishany,tobetakenintothehandsofgovern-\nment, theirvaluetobepaidtothecompany, andthetradetobelaidopen\ntoallthesubjectsofthestate.

TheEastIn-\ndia Company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of\ntheir exclusive privilege, have right, by Act of Parliament, to continue a\ncorporation with a joint stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity to\nthe East Indies in common with the rest of their fellow-subjects. But in\nthissituation, thesuperiorvigilanceandattentionofprivateadventurers\nwould,inallprobability,soonmakethemwearyofthetrade.\n1627 [31] An eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political\neconomy, the Abbe Morellet, gives a list of fifty-five joint stock companies\nforforeigntradewhichhavebeenestablishedindifferentpartsofEurope\nsince the year 1600, and which, according to him, have all failed from\nmismanagement, notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges. He has\nbeenmisinformedwithregardtothehistoryoftwoorthreeofthem,which\nwerenotjointstockcompaniesandhavenotfailed. But,incompensation, G.ed.p756\ntherehavebeenseveraljointstockcompanieswhichhavefailed,andwhich\nhehasomitted.\n1628 [32] The only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to\ncarry on successfully without an exclusive privilege are those of which all\ntheoperationsarecapableofbeingreducedtowhatiscalledaRoutine,or\nto such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of this\nkindis,first,thebankingtrade;secondly,thetradeofinsurancefromfire,\nandfromseariskandcaptureintimeofwar;thirdly,thetradeofmaking\nand maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly, the similar trade\nofbringingwaterforthesupplyofagreatcity.\n1629 [33] Though the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat ab-\nstruse, the practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules.

Theprincipalbankingcompanies\nin Europe, accordingly, are joint stock companies, many of which manage\ntheir trade very successfully without any exclusive privilege.

Neither\ntheLondonAssurancenortheRoyalExchangeAssurancecompanieshave\nanysuchprivilege.\n1631 [35] When a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management\nof it becomes quite simple and easy, and it is reducible to strict rule and G.ed.p757\nmethod.

Inthefourtradesabovementioned,\nboththosecircumstancesconcur.\n1633 [37] The great and general utility of the banking trade when prudently\nmanaged has been fully explained in the second, book of this Inquiry.\nBut a public bank which is to support public credit, and upon particu-\nlar emergencies to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to\nthe amount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before it comes\nin, requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private\ncopartnery.\n1634 [38] The trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private\npeople, and by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin\nan individual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In or-\nder to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should\nhave a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint stock\ncompanies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the\n586", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nattorney-general of one hundred and fifty private insurers who had failed\ninthecourseofafewyears.\n1635 [39] That navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes\nnecessary for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general\nutility, while at the same time they frequently require a greater expense G.ed.p758\nthansuitsthefortunesofprivatepeople,issufficientlyobvious.\n1636 [40] Except the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to re-\ncollect any other in which all the three circumstances requisite for ren-\nderingreasonabletheestablishmentofajointstockcompanyconcur.

This necessity is greatest with those to whom the emolu-\nmentsoftheirprofessionaretheonlysourcefromwhichtheyexpecttheir\nfortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence.

The greatness\nof the objects which are to be acquired by success in some particular pro-\nfessions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertion of a few men of\nextraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are evidently\nnot necessary in order to occasion the greatest exertions. Rivalship and\nemulation render excellency, even in mean professions, an object of ambi- G.ed.p760\ntion,andfrequentlyoccasiontheverygreatestexertions. Greatobjects,on\nthe contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of application, have\nseldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable exertion. In England,\nsuccess in the profession of the law leads to some very great objects of\nambition; and yet how few men, born to easy fortunes, have ever in this\ncountrybeeneminentinthatprofession!\n1641 [5] The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished\nmoreorlessthenecessityofapplicationintheteachers. Theirsubsistence,\nso far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund\naltogetherindependentoftheirsuccessandreputationintheirparticular\nprofessions.\n1642 [6] In some universities the salary makes but a part, and frequently but\na small part, of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part\narises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of applic-\nation, though always more or less diminished, is not in this case entirely\ntaken away. Reputation in his profession is still of some importance to\nhim, and he still has some dependency upon the affection, gratitude, and\n588", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfavourable report of those who have attended upon his instructions; and\nthese favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no way so well as by\ndeserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence with which he dis-\nchargeseverypartofhisduty.\n1643 [7] In other universities the teacher is prohibited from receiving any hon-\norary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of the\nrevenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this case, set\nas directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it. It is the in-\nterestofeverymantoliveasmuchathiseaseashecan;andifhisemolu-\nments are to be precisely the same, whether he does or does not perform\nsome very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest, at least as interest\nis vulgarly understood, either to neglect it altogether, or, if he is subject\nto some authority which will not suffer him to do this, to perform it in as\ncarelessandslovenlyamannerasthatauthoritywillpermit.

Allthatsuch\nsuperiors, however, canforcehimtodo, istoattenduponhispupilsacer-\ntain number of hours, that is, to give a certain number of lectures in the\nweek or in the year. What those lectures shall be must still depend upon\nthediligenceoftheteacher;andthatdiligenceislikelytobeproportioned\nto the motives which he has for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of\nthiskind,besides,isliabletobeexercisedbothignorantlyandcapriciously.\nIn its nature it is arbitrary and discretionary, and the persons who exer-\ncise it, neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor\nperhaps understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach, are\nseldom capable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of of-\nfice,too,theyarefrequentlyindifferenthowtheyexerciseit,andarevery\napt to censure or deprive him of his office wantonly, and without any just\ncause.

The slightest degree of know-\nledge and application will enable him to do this without exposing himself\nto contempt or derision, or saying anything that is really foolish, absurd,\nor ridiculous. The discipline of the college, at the same time, may enable\nhim to force all his pupils to the most regular attendance upon this sham\nlecture, andto maintain the most decentand respectful behaviourduring\nthewholetimeoftheperformance.\n1651 [15] The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not G.ed.p764\nforthebenefitofthestudents,butfortheinterest,ormoreproperlyspeak-\ning, for the ease of the masters.

But had it not been for\nthose institutions they would not have been commonly taught at all, and\nboth the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from\nthewantofthoseimportantpartsofeducation.\n1655 [19] The present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of\nthem, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of church-\nmen. TheywerefoundedbytheauthorityofthePope,andweresoentirely\nunder his immediate protection, that their members, whether masters or\nstudents,hadallofthemwhatwasthencalledthebenefitofclergy,thatis,\nwereexemptedfromtheciviljurisdictionofthecountriesinwhichtheirre-\nspectiveuniversitiesweresituated,andwereamenableonlytotheecclesi-\nasticaltribunals. Whatwastaughtinthegreaterpartofthoseuniversities\nwas suitable to the end of their institution, either theology, or something\nthatwasmerelypreparatorytotheology.\n1656 [20] When Christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had\nbecomethecommonlanguageofallthewesternpartsofEurope. Theser-\nvice of the church accordingly, and the translation of the Bible which was\nread in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is, in the com-\nmonlanguageofthecountry. Aftertheirruptionofthebarbarousnations\nwho overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the lan-\nguage of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally\npreserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the\ncircumstanceswhichfirstintroducedandrenderedthemreasonableareno\nmore. ThoughLatin,therefore,wasnolongerunderstoodanywherebythe\ngreatbodyofthepeople,thewholeserviceofthechurchstillcontinuedto\nbe performed in that language. Two different languages were thus estab-\n592", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlished in Europe, in the same manner as in ancient Egypt; a language of\nthepriests,andalanguageofthepeople;asacredandaprofane;alearned\nand an unlearned language. But it was necessary that the priests should\nunderstand something of that sacred and learned language in which they\nweretoofficiate;andthestudyoftheLatinlanguagethereforemade,from G.ed.p766\nthebeginning,anessentialpartofuniversityeducation.\n1657 [21] It was not so with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language.\nThe infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin translation\nof the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have been equally\ndictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal authority with the\nGreekandHebreworiginals. Theknowledgeofthosetwolanguages,there-\nfore, not being indispensably requisite to a churchman, the study of them\ndid not for a long time make a necessary part of the common course of\nuniversity education. There are some Spanish universities, I am assured,\nin which the study of the Greek language has never yet made any part of\nthat course. The first reformers found the Greek text of the New Testa-\nment, and even the Hebrew text of the Old, more favorable to their opin-\nionsthantheVulgatetranslation,which,asmightnaturallybesupposed,\nhad been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the Cath-\nolic Church. They set themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors of\nthat translation, which the Roman Catholic clergy were thus put under\nthe necessity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done\nwithoutsomeknowledgeoftheoriginallanguages,ofwhichthestudywas\ntherefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities, both\nofthosewhichembraced,andofthosewhichrejected,thedoctrinesofthe\nReformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that\nclassical learning which, though at first principally cultivated by Cathol-\nicsandItalians,happenedtocomeintofashionmuchaboutthesametime\nthatthedoctrinesoftheReformationweresetonfoot. Inthegreaterpart\nof universities, therefore, that language was taught previous to the study\nof philosophy, and as soon as the student had made some progress in the\nLatin. TheHebrewlanguagehavingnoconnectionwithclassicallearning,\nand,excepttheHolyScriptures,beingthelanguageofnotasinglebookin\nany esteem, the study of it did not commonly commence till after that of\nphilosophy,andwhenthestudenthadentereduponthestudyoftheology.\n1658 [22] Originally the first rudiments both of the Greek and Latin languages\nwere taught in universities, and in some universities they still continue\nto be so. In others it is expected that the student should have previously\nacquiredatleasttherudimentsofoneorbothofthoselanguages,ofwhich\nthe study continues to make everywhere a very considerable part of uni-\nversityeducation.\n1659 [23] The ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches;\nphysics,ornaturalphilosophy;ethics,ormoralphilosophy;andlogic. This\ngeneraldivisionseemsperfectlyagreeabletothenatureofthings.\n1660 [24] The great phenomena of nature- the revolutions of the heavenly bod- G.ed.p767\n593", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nies,eclipses,comets;thunder,lightning,andotherextraordinarymeteors;\nthe generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals-\nare objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they natur-\nally call forth the curiosity, of mankind to inquire into their causes. Su-\nperstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those\nwonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy\nafterwardsendeavouredtoaccountforthemfrommorefamiliarcauses,or\nfromsuchasmankindwerebetteracquaintedwith,thantheagencyofthe\ngods. As those great phenomena are the first objects of human curiosity,\nso the science which pretends to explain them must naturally have been\nthe first branch of philosophy that was cultivated. The first philosophers,\naccordingly, of whom history has preserved any account, appear to have G.ed.p768\nbeennaturalphilosophers.\n1661 [25] In every age and country of the world men must have attended to the\ncharacters,designs,andactionsofoneanother,andmanyreputablerules\nand maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and\napprovedofbycommonconsent. Assoonaswritingcameintofashion,wise\nmen,orthosewhofanciedthemselvessuch,wouldnaturallyendeavourto\nincrease the number of those established and respected maxims, and to\nexpress their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct,\nsometimesinthemoreartificialformofapologues,likewhatarecalledthe\nfablesofAesop;andsometimesinthemoresimpleoneofapophthegms,or\nwisesayings,liketheProverbsofSolomon,theversesofTheognisandPho-\ncyllides,andsomepartoftheworksofHesiod.

Somethingofthesamekindwasafterwardsattemptedinmor-\nals. The maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical order,\nand connected together by a few common principles, in the same manner\nas they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of nature.\nThe science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting\nprinciplesiswhatisproperlycalledmoralphilosophy.\n1662 [26] Different authors gave different systems both of natural and moral\nphilosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different\nsystems,forfrombeingalwaysdemonstrations,werefrequentlyatbestbut\nvery slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had no\nother foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language.\nSpeculative systems have in all ages of the world been adopted for reas-\nonstoo frivoloustohave determinedthejudgment ofany man ofcommon\nsense in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross sophistry has\n594", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nscarceeverhadanyinfluenceupontheopinionsofmankind,exceptinmat-\nters of philosophy and speculation; and in these it has frequently had the\ngreatest.

Thoughinitsoriginposteriorbothtophysics\nandtoethics,itwascommonlytaught,notindeedinall,butinthegreater\npart of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously to either of those sci-\nences. The student, it seems to have been thought, to understand well\nthedifferencebetweengoodandbadreasoningbeforehewasledtoreason\nuponsubjectsofsogreatimportance.\n1663 [27] This ancient division of philosophy into three parts was in the greater\npartoftheuniversitiesofEuropechangedforanotherintofive.\n1664 [28] In the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature\neitherofthehumanmindoroftheDeity,madeapartofthesystemofphys-\nics. Thosebeings,inwhatevertheiressencemightbesupposedtoconsist,\nwere parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too, product-\nive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could either\nconclude or conjecture concerning them, made, as it were, two chapters,\nthough no doubt two very important ones, of the science which pretended\nto give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great system of the\nuniverse. But in the universities of Europe, where philosophy was taught\nonly as subservient to theology, it was natural to dwell longer upon these\ntwo chapters than upon any other of the science. They were gradually\nmore and more extended, and were divided into many inferior chapters,\ntill at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so little can be known, came\nto take up as much room in the system of philosophy as the doctrine of\nbodies, of which so much can be known. The doctrines concerning those\ntwo subjects were considered as making two distinct sciences. What are\ncalled Metaphysics or Pneumatics were set in opposition to Physics, and G.ed.p771\nwere cultivated not only as the more sublime, but, for the purposes of a\nparticular profession, as the more useful science of the two. The proper\nsubject of experiment and observation, a subject in which a careful atten-\ntion is capable of making so many useful discoveries, was almost entirely\nneglected. The subject in which, after a few very simple and almost obvi-\nous truths, the most careful attention can discover nothing but obscurity\nanduncertainty,andcanconsequentlyproducenothingbutsubtletiesand\nsophisms,wasgreatlycultivated.\n1665 [29] Whenthosetwoscienceshadthusbeensetinoppositiontooneanother,\nthecomparisonbetweenthemnaturallygavebirthtoathird,towhatwas\ncalledOntology,orthesciencewhichtreatedofthequalitiesandattributes\n595", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwhich were common to both the subjects of the other two sciences. But if\nsubtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the Metaphysics or\nPneumaticsoftheschools,theycomposedthewholeofthiscobwebscience\nofOntology,whichwaslikewisesometimescalledMetaphysics.\n1666 [30] Wherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man, considered\nnotonlyasanindividual,butasthememberofafamily,ofastate,andof\nthegreatsocietyofmankind,wastheobjectwhichtheancientmoralphilo-\nsophyproposedtoinvestigate. Inthatphilosophythedutiesofhumanlife\nweretreatedassubservienttothehappinessandperfectionofhumanlife.\nBut when moral, as well as natural philosophy, came to be taught only as\nsubservienttotheology,thedutiesofhumanlifeweretreatedofaschiefly\nsubservient to the happiness of a life to come. In the ancient philosophy\nthe perfection of virtue was represented as necessarily productive, to the\nperson who possessed it, of the most perfect happiness in this life. In the\nmodernphilosophyitwasfrequentlyrepresentedasgenerally,orratheras\nalmost always, inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and\nheavenwastobeearnedonlybypenanceandmortification,bytheauster-\nities and abasement of a monk; not by the liberal, generous, and spirited\nconduct of a man. Casuistry and an ascetic morality made up, in most\ncases, the greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the\nmost important of all the different branches of philosophy became in this\nmannerbyfarthemostcorrupted.\n1667 [31] Such, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education in G.ed.p772\nthegreaterpartoftheuniversitiesinEurope. Logicwastaughtfirst: Onto-\nlogycameinthesecondplace: Pneumatology,comprehendingthedoctrine\nconcerning the nature of the human soul and of the Deity, in the third:\nin the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy which was\nconsidered as immediately connected with the doctrines of Pneumatology,\nwith the immortality of the human soul, and with the rewards and pun-\nishmentswhich,fromthejusticeoftheDeity,weretobeexpectedinalife\nto come: a short and superficial system of Physics usually concluded the\ncourse.\n1668 [32] The alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced into\ntheancientcourseofphilosophywereallmeantfortheeducationofecclesi-\nastics,andtorenderitamoreproperintroductiontothestudyoftheology.\nBut the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry, the casuistry and\nthe ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it, certainly\ndidnotrenderitmoreproperfortheeducationofgentlemenormenofthe\nworld,ormorelikelyeithertoimprovetheunderstanding,ortomendthe\nheart.\n1669 [33] This course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the\ngreater part of the universities of Europe, with more or less diligence, ac-\ncordingastheconstitutionofeachparticularuniversityhappenstorender\ndiligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In some of the richest\nand best endowed universities, the tutors content themselves with teach-\n596", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ning a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course; and\neventhesetheycommonlyteachverynegligentlyandsuperficially.\n1670 [34] Theimprovementswhich,inmoderntimes,havebeenmadeinseveral\ndifferent branches of philosophy have not, the greater part of them, been\nmade in universities, though some no doubt have.

Those improvements were more easily introduced into\nsome of the poorer universities, in which the teachers, depending upon G.ed.p773\ntheir reputation for the greater part of their subsistence, were obliged to\npaymoreattentiontothecurrentopinionsoftheworld.\n1671 [35] But though the public schools and universities of Europe were origin-\nally intended only for the education of a particular profession, that of\nchurchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing\ntheir pupils even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that\nprofession,yettheygraduallydrewtothemselvestheeducationofalmost\nall other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune.\nNobettermethod,itseems,couldbefallenuponofspending,withanyad-\nvantage,thelongintervalbetweeninfancyandthatperiodoflifeatwhich\nmen begin to apply in good earnest to the real business of the world, the\nbusinesswhichistoemploythemduringtheremainderoftheirdays.

Our young people, it\nis said, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young\nman who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one\nand twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went\nabroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in\nthreeorfouryears.

By gymnastic exercises it was intended to harden his body, to\nsharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of\nwar;andastheGreekmilitiawas,byallaccounts,oneofthebestthatever\nwas in the world, this part of their public education must have answered\ncompletelythepurposeforwhichitwasintended. Bytheotherpart,music,\nitwasproposed,atleastbythephilosophersandhistorianswhohavegiven\nus an account of those institutions, to humanize the mind, to soften the\ntemper, and to dispose it for performing all the social and moral duties\nbothofpublicandprivatelife.\n1676 [40] In ancient Rome the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the\npurpose as those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece, and they seem to\nhave answered it equally well. But among the Romans there was noth-\ning which corresponded to the musical education of the Greeks. The mor-\nals of the Romans, however, both in private and public life, seem to have\nbeen not only equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal superior to those of\nthe Greeks. That they were superior in private life, we have the express\ntestimonyofPolybiusandofDionysiusofHalicarnassus,twoauthorswell G.ed.p775\nacquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor if the Greek and Ro-\nman history bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the\nRomans. Thegoodtemperandmoderationofcontendingfactionsseemsto\nbe the most essential circumstances in the public morals of a free people.\nButthefactionsoftheGreekswerealmostalwaysviolentandsanguinary;\nwhereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any\nRomanfaction;andfromthetimeoftheGracchitheRomanrepublicmay\nbeconsideredasinrealitydissolved. Notwithstanding,therefore,thevery\nrespectable authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius, and notwithstand-\ning the very ingenious reasons by which Mr. Montesquieu endeavours to\nsupportthatauthority,itseemsprobablethatthemusicaleducationofthe G.ed.p776\nGreeks had no great effect in mending their morals, since, without any\nsuch education, those of the Romans were upon the whole superior. The\nrespect of those ancient sages for the institutions of their ancestors had\nprobably disposed them to find much political wisdom in what was, per-\n598", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nhaps, merely an ancient custom, continued without interruption from the\nearliest period of those societies to the times in which they had arrived\nat a considerable degree of refinement. Music and dancing are the great\namusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the great accomplish-\nmentswhicharesupposedtofitanymanforentertaininghissociety. Itis\nso at this day among the negroes on the coast of Africa. It was so among\ntheancientCelts,amongtheancientScandinavians,and,aswemaylearn\nfromHomer, amongtheancientGreeksinthetimesprecedingtheTrojan\nwar. When the Greek tribes had formed themselves into little republics,\nit was natural that the study of those accomplishments should, for a long\ntime,makeapartofthepublicandcommoneducationofthepeople.\n1677 [41] The masters who instructed the young people, either in music or in\nmilitaryexercises,donotseemtohavebeenpaid,orevenappointedbythe\nstate,eitherinRomeoreveninAthens,theGreekrepublicofwhoselaws\nand customs we are the best informed.

In Rome it became a science very early,\nand gave a considerable degree of illustration to those citizens who had\nthereputationofunderstandingit. IntherepublicsofancientGreece,par-\nticularly in Athens, the ordinary courts of justice consisted of numerous,\nand therefore disorderly, bodies of people, who frequently decided almost\natrandom,orasclamour,faction,andpartyspirithappenedtodetermine.\nThe ignominy of an unjust decision, when it was to be divided among five G.ed.p779\nhundred, a thousand, or fifteen hundred people (for some of their courts\nweresoverynumerous),couldnotfallveryheavyuponanyindividual. At\nRome, on the contrary, the principal courts of justice consisted either of a\nsingle judge or of a small number of judges, whose characters, especially\nastheydeliberatedalwaysinpublic,couldnotfailtobeverymuchaffected\nby any rash or unjust decision. In doubtful cases such courts, from their\nanxiety to avoid blame, would naturally endeavour to shelter themselves\nunder the example or precedent of the judges who had sat before them,\neither in the same or in some other court. This attention to practice and\nprecedentnecessarilyformedtheRomanlawintothatregularandorderly\nsystem in which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention\nhas had the like effects upon the laws of every other country where such\nattention has taken place. The superiority of character in the Romans\nover that of the Greeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of\n600", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nHalicarnassus,wasprobablymoreowingtothebetterconstitutionoftheir\ncourts of justice than to any of the circumstances to which those authors\nascribe it. The Romans are said to have been particularly distinguished\nfortheirsuperiorrespecttoanoath.

Ourprejudiceisperhapsrathertooverratethem. Butexceptinwhat\nrelated to military exercises, the state seems to have been at no pains to\nform those great abilities: for I cannot be induced to believe that the mu-\nsical education of the Greeks could be of much consequence in forming\nthem.

As soon as they are able to work they must apply to some trade\nby which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, is generally so G.ed.p785\nsimple and uniform as to give little exercise to the understanding, while,\nat the same time, their labour is both so constant and so severe, that it\nleaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to, or even to think\nof,anythingelse.\n1690 [54] But though the common people cannot, in any civilised society, be so\nwell instructed as people of some rank and fortune, the most essential\nparts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired\nat so early a period of life that the greater part even of those who are to\nbe bred to the lowest occupations have time to acquire them before they\ncanbeemployedinthoseoccupations.

In England the establishment of charity schools\nhas had an effect of the same kind, though not so universally, because\nthe establishment is not so universal. If in those little schools the books,\nby which the children are taught to read, were a little more instructive\nthan they commonly are, and if, instead of a little smattering of Latin,\nwhichthechildrenofthecommonpeoplearesometimestaughtthere,and\nwhich can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were instructed in the\nelementarypartsofgeometryandmechanics,theliteraryeducationofthis\nrank of people would perhaps be as complete as it can be.

Theyfacilitatedtheacquisitionofthoseexercisesbyap-\npointingacertainplaceforlearningandpractisingthem,andbygranting\ntocertainmasterstheprivilegeofteachinginthatplace. Thosemastersdo\nnot appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges of any kind.\nTheir reward consisted altogether in what they got from their scholars;\nand a citizen who had learnt his exercises in the public gymnasia had no\nsort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them privately, provided\nthe latter had learnt them equally well. Those republics encouraged the\nacquisition of those exercises by bestowing little premiums and badges of\ndistinctionupon: thosewhoexcelledinthem.

In the present times, indeed, that martial\nspirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined standing army, would\nnot perhaps be sufficient for the defence and security of any society.

They were much more simple. When they were once established\nthey executed themselves, and it required little or no attention from gov-\nernment to maintain them in the most perfect vigour.

This is a species of instruction of which the ob-\nject is not so much to render the people good citizens in this world, as\nto prepare them for another and a better world in a life to come. The\nteachersofthedoctrinewhichcontainsthisinstruction,inthesameman-\nner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their subsistence\nupon the voluntary contributions of their hearers, or they may derive it\nfrom some other fund to which the law of their country may entitle them;\nsuch as a landed estate, a tithe or land tax, an established salary or sti-\npend. Theirexertion,theirzealandindustry,arelikelytobemuchgreater\nin the former situation than in the latter. In this respect the teachers\nof new religions have always had a considerable advantage in attacking G.ed.p789\nthoseancientandestablishedsystemsofwhichtheclergy,reposingthem-\nselves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up the fervour of faith\nanddevotioninthegreatbodyofthepeople,andhavinggiventhemselves\nup to indolence, were become altogether incapable of making any vigor-\nous exertion in defence even of their own establishment. The clergy of an\nestablished and well-endowed religion frequently become men of learning\nand elegance, who possess all the virtues of gentlemen, or which can re-\ncommend them to the esteem of gentlemen: but they are apt gradually to\nlose the qualities, both good and bad, which gave them authority and in-\nfluencewiththeinferiorranksofpeople,andwhichhadperhapsbeenthe\noriginal causes of the success and establishment of their religion. Such a\nclergy, when attacked by a set of popular and bold, though perhaps stu-\npid and ignorant enthusiasts, feel themselves as perfectly defenceless as\ntheindolent,effeminate,andfull-fednationsofthesouthernpartsofAsia\nwhen they were invaded by the active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the\nNorth. Suchaclergy,uponsuchanemergency,havecommonlynootherre-\nsourcethantocalluponthecivilmagistratetopersecute,destroyordrive\nout their adversaries, as disturbers of the public peace. It was thus that\nthe Roman Catholic clergy called upon the civil magistrates to persecute\nthe Protestants, and the Church of England to persecute the Dissenters;\nand that in general every religious sect, when it has once enjoyed for a\ncentury or two the security of a legal establishment, has found itself in-\ncapableofmakinganyvigorousdefenceagainstanynewsectwhichchose\nto attack its doctrine or discipline. Upon such occasions the advantage in\npoint of learning and good writing may sometimes be on the side of the\nestablishedchurch. Buttheartsofpopularity,alltheartsofgainingpros-\nelytes,areconstantlyonthesideofitsadversaries. InEnglandthosearts\n608", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nhave been long neglected by the well-endowed clergy of the established\nchurch,andareatpresentchieflycultivatedbytheDissentersandbythe\nMethodists. The independent provisions, however, which in many places\nhave been made for dissenting teachers by means of voluntary subscrip-\ntions, of trust rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to\nhave abated the zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of\nthembecomeverylearned,ingenious,andrespectablemen;buttheyhave\nin general ceased to be very popular preachers.

Theparochialclergyderive,manyofthem,\na very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary oblations\nof the people; a source of revenue which confession gives them many op-\nportunities of improving.

InRomanCath-\nolic countries the spirit of devotion is supported altogether by the monks\nand by the poorer parochial clergy. The great dignitaries of the church,\nwith all the accomplishments of gentlemen and men of the world, and\nsometimes with those of men of learning, are careful enough to maintain\nthe necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give themselves\nanytroubleabouttheinstructionofthepeople.\n1700 [3] \u2018Most of the arts and professions in a state,\u2019 says by far the most illus-\ntrious philosopher and historian of the present age,\u2018are of such a nature\nthat, while they promote the interests of the society, they are also useful\nor agreeable to some individuals; and in that case, the constant rule of\nthe magistrate, except perhaps on the first introduction of any art, is to\nleavetheprofessiontoitself,andtrustitsencouragementtotheindividu-\nalswhoreapthebenefitofit.

Timesofviolentreligiouscontroversy\nhave generally been times of equally violent political faction. Upon such\noccasions, each political party has either found it, or imagined it, for its G.ed.p792\ninteresttoleagueitselfwithsomeoneorotherofthecontendingreligious\nsects. But this could be done only by adopting, or at least by favouring,\nthe tenets of that particular sect. The sect which had the good fortune\n610", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto be leagued with the conquering party necessarily shared in the victory\nof its ally, by whose favour and protection it was soon enabled in some\ndegree to silence and subdue all its adversaries. Those adversaries had\ngenerally leagued themselves with the enemies of the conquering party,\nandwerethereforetheenemiesofthatparty.

As they had generally contributed\na good deal to the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should\nhavesomeshareinthespoil. Theywereweary,besides,ofhumouringthe\npeople, and of depending upon their caprice for a subsistence. In making\nthisdemand,therefore,theyconsultedtheirowneaseandcomfort,without\ntroubling themselves about the effect which it might have in future times\nupontheinfluenceandauthorityoftheirorder. Thecivilmagistrate, who\ncould comply with this demand only by giving them something which he\nwouldhavechosenmuchrathertotake,ortokeeptohimself,wasseldom\nvery forward to grant it.

While he\nremains in a country village his conduct may be attended to, and he may\nbe obliged to attend to it himself. In this situation, and in this situation\nonly, he may have what is called a character to lose. But as soon as he\ncomes into a great city he is sunk in obscurity and darkness. His conduct\n613", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nis observed and attended to by nobody, and he is therefore very likely to\nneglect it himself, and to abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy\nand vice.

They can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan\nand with one spirit, as much as if they were under the direction of one\nman; and they are frequently, too, under such direction. Their interest as\nan incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is\nsometimesdirectlyoppositetoit.

With regard to such matters,\ntherefore, his authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the\nunited authority of the clergy of the established church. The public tran-\nquillity, however, and his own security, may frequently depend upon the\ndoctrineswhichtheymaythinkpropertopropagateconcerningsuchmat-\nters. As he can seldom directly oppose their decision, therefore, with\nproperweightandauthority,itisnecessarythatheshouldbeabletoinflu-\nenceit;andbecaninfluenceitonlybythefearsandexpectationswhichhe\nmay excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order. Those fears\nand expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or other punish-\nment,andintheexpectationoffurtherpreferment.\n1716 [19] In all Christian churches the benefices of the clergy are a sort of free-\nholds which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life or good be-\nhaviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable\nto be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign\nor of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain\ntheirauthoritywiththepeople,whowouldthenconsiderthemasmercen-\nary dependents upon the court, in the security of whose instructions they\ncould no longer have any confidence. But should the sovereign attempt\nirregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of clergymen of their\nfreeholds,onaccount,perhaps,oftheirhavingpropagated,withmorethan\nordinaryzeal,somefactiousorseditiousdoctrine,hewouldonlyrender,by\nsuch persecution, both them and their doctrine ten times more popular,\nand therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous, than they had\nbeen before.

The means commonly employed, however, the imprisonment\nof all the refractory members, one would think were forcible enough. The\n616", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nprincesofthehouseofStewartsometimesemployedthelikemeansinor-\nder to influence some of the members of the Parliament of England; and\nthey generally found them equally intractable.

That ex-\nperiment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are\nalways the easiest and the safest instruments of governments, as force\nand violence are the worst and the most dangerous, yet such, it seems, is\nthe natural insolence of man that he almost always disdains to use the\ngoodinstrument,exceptwhenhecannotordarenotusethebadone. The\nFrench government could and durst use force, and therefore disdained to\nusemanagementandpersuasion. Butthereisnoorderofmen,itappears,\nI believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so dangerous,\nor rather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the\nrespected clergy of any established church. The rights, the privileges, the\npersonal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic who is upon good terms\nwith his own order are, even in the most despotic governments, more re-\nspected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune.\nIt is so in every gradation of despotism, from that of the gentle and mild\ngovernmentofParistothatoftheviolentandfuriousgovernmentofCon-\nstantinople. But though this order of men can scarce ever be forced, they\nmaybemanagedaseasilyasanyother;andthesecurityofthesovereign,\nas well as the public tranquillity, seems to depend very much upon the\nmeans which he has of managing them; and those means seem to consist\naltogetherintheprefermentwhichhehastobestowuponthem.\n1717 [20] In the ancient constitution of the Christian church, the bishop of each\ndiocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of\nthe episcopal city.

The clergy, however, soon grew weary of the trouble of managing\nthem, and found it easier to elect their own bishops themselves.

Thetenantsoftheclergywere,likethoseofthegreatbarons,almost\nall tenants at will, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and\nthereforeliabletobecalledoutatpleasureinordertofightinanyquarrel\nin which the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above\nthe rents of those estates, the clergy possessed in the tithes, a very large\nportion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe.\nThe revenues arising from both those species of rents were, the greater\npart of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle poultry, etc. The quant-\nityexceededgreatlywhattheclergycouldthemselvesconsume;andthere\nwereneitherartsnormanufacturesfortheproduceofwhichtheycouldex-\nchangethesurplus.

In the produce of arts, manufactures, and commerce,\nthe clergy, like the great barons, found something for which they could\nexchange theirrude produce, and thereby discoveredthe means ofspend-\ningtheirwholerevenuesupontheirownpersons,withoutgivinganycon-\nsiderable share of them to other people. Their charity became gradually\nlessextensive,theirhospitalitylessliberalorlessprofuse. Theirretainers\nbecame consequently less numerous, and by degrees dwindled away alto-\ngether. The clergy too, like the great barons, wished to get a better rent\nfrom their landed estates, in order to spend it, in the same manner, upon\nthe gratification of their own private vanity and folly. But this increase\nof rent could be got only by granting leases to their tenants, who thereby\nbecameinagreatmeasureindependentofthem. Thetiesofinterestwhich G.ed.p804\nboundtheinferiorranksofpeopletotheclergywereinthismannergradu-\nally broken and dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner\nthanthosewhichboundthesameranksofpeopletothegreatbarons: be-\ncause the benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much\nsmaller than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each bene-\nfice wasmuch sooner ableto spend thewhole of itsrevenue upon hisown\nperson. During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\nthe power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in\nfull vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command\nwhichtheyhadoncehadoverthegreatbodyofthepeople,wasverymuch\ndecayed. The power of the church was by that time very nearly reduced\n620", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthrough the greater part of Europe to what arose from her spiritual au-\nthority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened when it\nceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The\ninferiorranksofpeoplenolongerlookeduponthatorder,astheyhaddone\nbefore, as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of their indi-\ngence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by the vanity,\nluxury,andexpenseofthericherclergy,whoappearedtospendupontheir\nownpleasureswhathadalwaysbeforebeenregardedasthepatrimonyof\nthepoor.\n1723 [26] In this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of\nEurope endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had\nin the disposal of the great benefices of the church, by procuring to the\ndeansandchaptersofeachdiocesetherestorationoftheirancientrightof\nelecting the bishop, and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the\nabbot. The re-establishing of this ancient order was the object of several\nstatutes enacted in England during the course of the fourteenth century,\nparticularlyofwhatiscalledtheStatuteofProvisors;andofthePragmatic\nSanctionestablishedinFranceinthefifteenthcentury. Inordertorender\ntheelectionvalid,itwasnecessarythatthesovereignshouldbothconsent\ntoitbeforehand,andafterwardsapproveofthepersonelected;andthough\nthe election was still supposed to be free, he had, however, all the indir-\nect means which his situation necessarily afforded him of influencing the\nclergyinhisowndominions. Otherregulationsofasimilartendencywere\nestablishedinotherpartsofEurope. Butthepowerofthepopeinthecol-\nlation of the great benefices of the church seems, before the Reformation,\nto have been nowhere so effectually and so universally restrained as in\nFranceandEngland.

In\nall the disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have\nalmost constantly taken party with the former. This independency of the\nclergy of France upon the court of Rome seems to be principally founded\nupon the Pragmatic Sanction and the Concordat. In the earlier periods of\nthe monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted\ntothepopeasthoseofanyothercountry. WhenRobert,thesecondprince\nof the Capetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of\nRome,hisownservants,itissaid,threwthevictualswhichcamefromhis\ntable to the dogs, and refused to taste anything themselves which little\nbeenpollutedbythecontactofapersoninhissituation. Theyweretaught\nto do so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own domin-\nions.\n1725 [28] The claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in\n621", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndefenceofwhichthecourtofRomehadfrequentlyshaken,andsometimes\noverturnedthethronesofsomeofthegreatestsovereignsinChristendom,\nwasinthismannereitherrestrainedormodified,orgivenupaltogether,in\nmany different parts of Europe, even before the time of the Reformation.\nAstheclergyhadnowlessinfluenceoverthepeople,sothestatehadmore\ninfluence over the clergy. The clergy, therefore, had both less power and\nlessinclinationtodisturbthestate.\n1726 [29] The authority of the Church of Rome was in this state of declension\nwhen the disputes which gave birth to the Reformation began in Ger-\nmany,andsoonspreadthemselvesthrougheverypartofEurope.

The reason of the new doctrines recommended them to\nsome, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the established\nclergy to a still greater number; but the zealous, passionate, and fanat-\nical,thoughfrequentlycoarseandrustic,eloquencewithwhichtheywere\nalmost everywhere inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest\nnumber.\n1727 [30] The success of the new doctrines was almost everywhere so great that\nthe princes who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court\nof Rome were by means of them easily enabled, in their own dominions,\nto overturn the church, which, having lost the respect and veneration of\nthe inferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The court\nof Rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts\nof Germany, whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be\nworththemanaging. Theyuniversally,therefore,establishedtheReform-\nation in their own dominions. The tyranny of Christian II and of Troll,\nArchbishop of Upsala, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from\nSweden. The pope favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus\nVasafoundnodifficultyinestablishingtheReformationinSweden. Chris-\ntian II was afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his\nconducthadrenderedhimasodiousasinSweden. Thepope,however,was\nstill disposed to favour him, and Frederick of Holstein, who had moun-\n622", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nted the throne in his stead, revenged himself by following the example of\nGustavusVasa. ThemagistratesofBerneandZurich,whohadnoparticu-\nlar quarrel with the pope, established with great ease the Reformation in\ntheir respective cantons, where just before some of the clergy had, by an\nimposturesomewhatgrosserthanordinary,renderedthewholeorderboth\nodiousandcontemptible.\n1728 [31] In this critical situation of its affairs, the papal court was at sufficient\npains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of France and\nSpain, of whom the latter was at that time Emperor of Germany. With\ntheir assistance it was enabled, though not without great difficulty and\nmuch bloodshed, either to suppress altogether or to obstruct very much\nthe progress of the Reformation in their dominions. It was well enough\ninclined, too, to be complaisant to the King of England. But from the\ncircumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving offence to a\nstillgreatersovereign,CharlesV,KingofSpainandEmperorofGermany.\nHenry VIII accordingly, though he did not embrace himself the greater G.ed.p807\npartofthedoctrinesoftheReformation,wasyetenabled,bytheirgeneral\nprevalence,tosuppressallthemonasteries,andtoabolishtheauthorityof\ntheChurchofRomeinhisdominions.

When the followers of the Reformation in one coun-\ntry, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as they\nhadnocommonjudgetoappealto,thedisputecouldneverbedecided;and\nmanysuchdisputesaroseamongthem. Thoseconcerningthegovernment\nofthechurch,andtherightofconferringecclesiasticalbenefices,wereper-\nhaps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society.

Suchaclergy, however, whiletheypaytheircourtinthis\nmanner to the higher ranks of life, are very apt to neglect altogether the\nmeans of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower.

The clergy,\nin order to preserve their influence in those popular elections, became, or\naffected to become, many of them, fanatics themselves, encouraged fan-\naticism among the people, and gave the preference almost always to the\nmostfanaticalcandidate.

Theprivatetamperingofsomeoftheneighbouring\nclergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently to prevent, this concur-\nrence, and the popular arts which they cultivate in order to enable them\nupon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are perhaps the causes\nwhich principally keep up whatever remains of the old fanatical spirit,\neitherintheclergyorinthepeopleofScotland.\n1734 [37] The equality which the Presbyterian form of church government es-\ntablishes among the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or\necclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice. In all\nPresbyterianchurchestheequalityofauthorityisperfect: thatofbenefice\nisnotso. Thedifference,however,betweenonebeneficeandanotherissel-\ndomsoconsiderableascommonlytotemptthepossessorevenofthesmall\none to pay court to his patron by the vile arts of flattery and assentation\ninordertogetabetter.

Nothing but the\nmost exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. The\nvices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and are, be-\nsides, almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his\nownconduct,therefore,heisobligedtofollowthatsystemofmoralswhich\nthe common people respect the most. He gains their esteem and affec-\ntion by that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead\nhimtofollow. Thecommonpeoplelookuponhimwiththatkindnesswith\nwhichwenaturallyregardonewhoapproachessomewhattoourowncon-\ndition,butwho,wethink,oughttobeinahigher. Theirkindnessnaturally\nprovokes his kindness. He becomes careful to instruct them, and attent-\nive to assist and relieve them. He does not even despise the prejudices\nof people who are disposed to be so favourable to him, and never treats\nthem with those contemptuous and arrogant airs which we so often meet\nwith in the proud dignitaries of opulent and well-endowed churches. The\nPresbyterianclergy,accordingly,havemoreinfluenceoverthemindsofthe\ncommonpeoplethanperhapstheclergyofanyotherestablishedchurch. It\nisaccordinglyinPresbyteriancountriesonlythatweeverfindthecommon\npeopleconverted,withoutpersecution,completely,andalmosttoaman,to\ntheestablishedchurch.\n1736 [39] In countries where church benefices are the greater part of them very\nmoderate,achairinauniversityisgenerallyabetterestablishmentthana\nchurchbenefice. Theuniversitieshave,inthiscase,thepickingandchoos-\ningoftheirmembersfromallthechurchmenofthecountry,who,inevery\ncountry,constitutebyfarthemostnumerousclassofmenofletters. Where\nchurchbenefices,onthecontrary,aremanyofthemveryconsiderable,the\nchurchnaturallydrawsfromtheuniversitiesthegreaterpartoftheirem-\ninent men of letters, who generally find some patron who does himself\nhonour by procuring them church preferment. In the former situation we\nare likely to find the universities filled with the most eminent men of let-\nters that are to be found in the country. In the latter we are likely to find\nfew eminent men among them, and those few among the youngest mem-\nbers of the society, who are likely, too, to be drained away from it before\nthey can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to be of much\n626", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nuse to it. It is observed by Mr. de Voltaire, that Father Porr\u00e9e, a Jesuit of G.ed.p811\nno great eminence in the republic of letters, was the only professor they\nhad ever had in France whose works were worth the reading. In a coun-\ntry which has produced so many eminent men of letters, it must appear\nsomewhat singular that scarce one of them should have been a professor\nin a university. The famous Gassendi was, in the beginning of his life, a\nprofessorintheUniversityofAix. Uponthefirstdawningofhisgenius,it\nwasrepresentedtohimthatbygoingintothechurchhecouldeasilyfinda\nmuchmorequietandcomfortablesubsistence,aswellasabettersituation\nforpursuinghisstudies; andheimmediatelyfollowedtheadvice. Theob-\nservation of Mr. de Voltaire may be applied, I believe, not only to France,\nbut to all other Roman Catholic countries. We very rarely find, in any of\nthem,aneminentmanofletterswhoisaprofessorinauniversity,except,\nperhaps, in the professions of law and physic; professions from which the\nchurch is not so likely to draw them. After the Church of Rome, that of\nEnglandisbyfartherichestandbestendowedchurchinChristendom. In\nEngland,accordingly,thechurchiscontinuallydrainingtheuniversitiesof\nall their best and ablest members; and an old college tutor, who is known\nand distinguished in Europe as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to\nbe found there as in any Roman Catholic country. In Geneva, on the con-\ntrary,intheProtestantcantonsofSwitzerland,intheProtestantcountries\nof Germany, in Holland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most\neminentmenofletterswhomthosecountrieshaveproduced,have,notall\nindeed,butthefargreaterpartofthem,beenprofessorsinuniversities. In\nthose countries the universities are continually draining the church of all\nitsmosteminentmenofletters.\n1737 [40] Itmay,perhaps,beworthwhiletoremarkthat,ifweexpectthepoets,\na few orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other em-\ninentmenofletters,bothofGreeceandRome,appeartohavebeeneither\npublic or private teachers; generally either of philosophy or of rhetoric.\nThis remark will be found to hold true from the days of Lysias and Iso-\ncrates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those of Plutarch and Epictetus, of\nSuetoniusandQuintilian. Toimposeuponanymanthenecessityofteach- G.ed.p812\ning, year after year, any particular branch of science, seems, in reality, to\nbe the most effectual method for rendering him completely master of it\nhimself. By being obliged to go every year over the same ground, if he is\ngoodforanything,henecessarilybecomes,inafewyears,wellacquainted\nwith every part of it: and if upon any particular point he should form too\nhasty an opinion one year, when he comes in the course of his lectures to\nreconsiderthesamesubjecttheyearthereafter,heisverylikelytocorrect\nit. As to be a teacher of science is certainly the natural employment of\na mere man of letters, so is it likewise, perhaps, the education which is\nmostlikelytorenderhimamanofsolidlearningandknowledge.

The tithe, for example,\nisarealland-tax,whichputsitoutofthepoweroftheproprietorsofland\ntocontributesolargelytowardsthedefenceofthestateastheyotherwise\nmight be able to do. The rent of land, however, is, according to some, the\nsole fund, and, according to others, the principal fund, from which, in all\ngreatmonarchies,theexigenciesofthestatemustbeultimatelysupplied.\nThemoreofthisfundthatisgiventothechurch,theless,itisevident,can\nbe spared to the state. It may be laid down as a certain maxim that, all\notherthingsbeingsupposedequal,thericherthechurch,thepoorermust\nnecessarily be, either the sovereign on the one hand, or the people on the\nother; and, in all cases, the less able must the state be to defend itself. In\nseveral Protestant countries, particularly in all the Protestant cantons of\nSwitzerland,therevenuewhichancientlybelongedtotheRomanCatholic\nChurch,thetithesandchurchlands,hasbeenfoundafundsufficient,not\nonly to afford competent salaries to the established clergy, but to defray,\nwith little or no addition, all the other expenses of the state. The magis-\ntrates of the powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated\noutofthesavingsfromthisfundaverylargesum,supposedtoamountto G.ed.p813\nseveral millions, part of which is deposited in a public treasure, and part\nis placed at interest in what are called the public funds of the different\nindebted nations of Europe; chiefly in those of France and Great Britain.\nWhat may be the amount of the whole expense which the church, either\nof Berne, or of any other Protestant canton, costs the state, I do not pre-\ntend to know. By a very exact account it appears that, in 1755, the whole\nrevenue of the clergy of the Church of Scotland, including their glebe or\nchurch lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses, estimated\naccording to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to 68,514l.1s.5 1 d.\n12\nThis very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence to nine hundred\nandforty-fourministers. Thewholeexpenseofthechurch,includingwhat\nis occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of churches, and\nof the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to exceed eighty or\neighty-fivethousandpoundsayear. ThemostopulentchurchinChristen-\ndom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith, the fervour of devo-\ntion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere morals in the great body\nof the people, than this very poorly endowed Church of Scotland. All the\ngood effects, both civil and religious, which an established church can be\nsupposedtoproduce,areproducedbyitascompletelyasbyanyother.

InthegreaterpartoftheProtestantcantonsthere\nis not a single person to be found who does not profess himself to be of\nthe established church.

Itisreasonable,therefore,thattheyshouldbedefrayed\nbythegeneralcontributionofthewholesociety,allthedifferentmembers\ncontributing,asnearlyaspossible,inproportiontotheirrespectiveabilit-\nies.\n1744 [2] The expense of the administration of justice, too, may, no doubt, be\nconsidered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society.

This expense, however, might perhaps with equal propriety, and\neven with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those who receive\nthe immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or by the volun-\ntarycontribution ofthosewho thinktheyhave occasionforeither theone\northeother.\n1748 [6] Whentheinstitutionsorpublicworkswhicharebeneficialtothewhole\nsociety either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained al-\ntogether by the contribution of such particular members of the society as\naremostimmediatelybenefitedbythem,thedeficiencymustinmostcases\nbe made up by the general contribution of the whole society. The general G.ed.p816\nrevenue of the society, over and above defraying the expense of defend-\ningthesociety,andofsupportingthedignityofthechiefmagistrate,must\nmake up for the deficiency of many particular branches of revenue. The\nsources of this general or public revenue I shall endeavour to explain in\nthefollowingchapter.\n631", "CHAPTER II\nG.ed.p817\nOF THE SOURCES OF THE GENERAL OR\nPUBLIC REVENUE OF THE SOCIETY\n1749 [1] THE revenuewhichmustdefray,notonlytheexpenseofdefendingtheso-\ncietyandofsupportingthedignityofthechiefmagistrate,butalltheother\nnecessary expenses of government for which the constitution of the state\nhas not provided any particular revenue, may be drawn either, first, from\nsome fund which peculiarly belongs to the sovereign or commonwealth,\nand which is independent of the revenue of the people; or, secondly, from\ntherevenueofthepeople.\nPART THIRD\nOf the Funds or Sources of Revenue which\nmay peculiarly belong to the Sovereign or\nCommonwealth\n1750 [1] Thefundsorsourcesofrevenuewhichmaypeculiarlybelongtothesover-\neignorcommonwealthmustconsisteitherinstockorinland.\n1751 [2] Thesovereign,likeanyotherownerofstock,mayderivearevenuefrom\nit, either by employing it himself, or by lending it.

It arises\nprincipallyfromthemilkandincreaseofhisownherdsandflocks,ofwhich\nhe himself superintends the management, and is the principal shepherd\nor herdsman of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this earliest and\nrudest state of civil government only that profit has ever made the prin-\ncipalpartofthepublicrevenueofamonarchialstate.\n1753 [4] Small republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from\nthe profit of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburg is said to do so\nfrom the profits of a public wine cellar and apothecary\u2019s shop1.

The profit of a public bank has\nbeen a source of revenue to more considerable states. It has been so not\nonly to Hamburg, but to Venice and Amsterdam. A revenue of this kind\nhas even by some people been thought not below the attention of so great\nan empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the ordinary dividend of\nthe Bank of England at five and a half per cent and its capital at ten mil-\nlions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds, the net annual profit,\nafter paying the expense of management, must amount, it is said, to five\nhundred and ninety-two thousand nine hundred pounds.

The government ad-\nvances the expense of establishing the different offices, and of buying or\nhiring the necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid with a large profit\nby the duties upon what is carried. It is perhaps the only mercantile pro-\nject which has been successfully managed by, I believe, every sort of gov-\nernment. Thecapitaltobeadvancedisnotveryconsiderable. Thereisno\nmysteryinthebusiness.

Theotherex-\npenses of government were, the greater part of them, very moderate. The\nadministration of justice, it has been shown, instead of being a cause of\nexpense, was a source of revenue. The labour of the country people, for\nthreedaysbeforeandforthreedaysafterharvest,wasthoughtafundsuf-\nficient for making and maintaining all the bridges, highways, and other\npublicworkswhichthecommerceofthecountrywassupposedtorequire.\nIn those days the principal expense of the sovereign seems to have con-\nsisted in the maintenance of his own family and household. The officers\nof his household, accordingly, were then the great officers of state. The\nlord treasurer received his rents. The lord steward and lord chamberlain G.ed.p822\nlooked after the expense of his family. The care of his stables was com-\nmitted to the lord constable and the lord marshal. His houses were all\nbuiltintheformofcastles,andseemtohavebeentheprincipalfortresses\nwhich he possessed.

The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for example, in-\ncludingnotonlywhatisnecessaryfordefrayingthecurrentexpenseofthe\nyear,butforpayingtheinterestofthepublicdebts,andforsinkingapart\nof the capital of those debts, amounts to upwards of ten millions a year.\nButtheland-tax,atfourshillingsinthepound,fallsshortoftwomillionsa\nyear. Thisland-tax,asitiscalled,however,issupposedtobeone-fifth,not\nonly of the rent of all the land, but of that of all the houses, and of the in-\nterestofallthecapitalstockofGreatBritain,thatpartofitonlyexcepted\nwhich is either let to the public, or employed as farming stock in the cul-\ntivation of land. A very considerable part of the produce of this tax arises\nfrom the rent of houses, and the interest of capital stock. The land-tax of\nthe city of London, for example, at four shillings in the pound, amounts\nto123,399l.6s.7d.ThatofthecityofWestminster,to63,092l.1s.5d.Thatof\nthe palaces of Whitehall and St. James\u2019s, to 30,754l.6s.3d. A certain pro-\nportion of the land-tax is in the same manner assessed upon all the other\ncities and towns corporate in the kingdom, and arises almost altogether,\neitherfromtherentofhouses,orfromwhatissupposedtobetheinterest\nof trading and capital stock. According to the estimation, therefore, by\nwhich Great Britain is rated to the land-tax, the whole mass of revenue\narisingfromtherentofallthelands,fromthatofallthehouses,andfrom\nthe interest of all the capital stock, that part of it only excepted which is\n636", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\neither lent to the public, or employed in the cultivation of land, does not\nexceed ten millions sterling a year, the ordinary revenue which govern-\nment levies upon the people even in peaceable times. The estimation by\nwhichGreatBritainisratedtotheland-taxis,nodoubt,takingthewhole\nkingdom at an average, very much below the real value; though in sev- G.ed.p823\neral particular counties and districts it is said to be nearly equal to that\nvalue. Therentofthelandsalone,exclusivelyofthatofhouses,andofthe\ninterest of stock, has by many people been estimated at twenty millions,\nan estimation made in a great measure at random, and which, I appre-\nhend,isaslikelytobeaboveasbelowthetruth. ButifthelandsofGreat\nBritain, in the present state of their cultivation, do not afford a rent of\nmorethantwentymillionsayear,theycouldnotwellaffordthehalf,most\nprobably not the fourth part of that rent, if they all belonged to a single\nproprietor, and were put under the negligent, expensive, and oppressive\nmanagement of his factors and agents. The crown lands of Great Britain\ndo not at present afford the fourth part of the rent which could probably\nbe drawn from them if they were the property of private persons. If the\ncrown lands were more extensive, it is probable they would be still worse\nmanaged.\n1766 [17] The revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is\nin proportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole\nannualproduceofthelandofeverycountry, ifweexceptwhatisreserved\nfor seed, is either annually consumed by the great body of the people, or\nexchanged for something else that is consumed by them. Whatever keeps\ndown the produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to keeps\ndown the revenue of the great body of the people still more than it does\nthat of the proprietors of land. The rent of land, that portion of the pro-\nducewhichbelongstotheproprietors,isscarceanywhereinGreatBritain\nsupposed to be more than a third part of the whole produce. If the land\nwhich in one state of cultivation affords a rent of ten millions sterling a\nyear would in another afford a rent of twenty millions, the rent being, in\nboth cases, supposed a third part of the produce, the revenue of the pro-\nprietors would be less than it otherwise might be by ten millions a year\nonly; buttherevenueofthegreatbodyofthepeoplewouldbelessthanit\notherwise might be by thirty millions a year, deducting only what would\nbe necessary for seed. The population of the country would be less by\nthe number of people which thirty millions a year, deducting always the\nseed, could maintain according to the particular mode of living and ex-\npense which might take place in the different ranks of men among whom\ntheremainderwasdistributed.\n1767 [18] Though there is not at present, in Europe, any civilised state of any\nkind which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of G.ed.p824\nlands which are the property of the state, yet in all the great monarch-\nies of Europe there are still many large tracts of land which belong to the\ncrown. They are generally forest; and sometimes forest where, after trav-\n637", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nelling several miles, you will scarce find a single tree; a mere waste and\nloss of country in respect both of produce and population. In every great\nmonarchyofEuropethesaleofthecrownlandswouldproduceaverylarge\nsum of money, which, if applied to the payment of the public debts, would\ndeliverfrommortgageamuchgreaterrevenuethananywhichthoselands\nhave ever afforded to the crown. In countries where lands, improved and\ncultivated very highly, and yielding at the time of sale as great a rent as\ncan easily be got from them, commonly sell at thirty years\u2019 purchase, the\nunimproved, uncultivated, and low-rented crown lands might well be ex-\npected to sell at forty, fifty, or sixty years\u2019 purchase. The crown might\nimmediately enjoy the revenue which this great price would redeem from\nmortgage. In the course of a few years it would probably enjoy another\nrevenue. Whenthecrownlandshadbecomeprivateproperty,theywould,\nin the course of a few years, become well improved and well cultivated.\nTheincreaseoftheirproducewouldincreasethepopulationofthecountry\nby augmenting the revenue and consumption of the people. But the rev-\nenuewhichthecrownderivesfromthedutiesofcustomsandexcisewould\nnecessarilyincreasewiththerevenueandconsumptionofthepeople.\n1768 [19] The revenue which, in any civilised monarchy, the crown derives from\nthecrownlands,thoughitappearstocostnothingtoindividuals,inreality\ncostsmoretothesocietythanperhapsanyotherequalrevenuewhichthe\ncrown enjoys. It would, in all cases, be for the interest of the society to\nreplace this revenue to the crown by some other equal revenue, and to\ndivide the lands among the people, which could not well be done better,\nperhaps,thanbyexposingthemtopublicsale.\n1769 [20] Lands for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence- parks, gardens,\npublicwalks,etc.,possessionswhichareeverywhereconsideredascauses\nof expense, not as sources of revenue- seem to be the only lands which, in\nagreatandcivilisedmonarchy,oughttobelongtothecrown.\n1770 [21] Public stock and public lands, therefore, the two sources of revenue\nwhichmaypeculiarlybelongtothesovereignorcommonwealth,beingboth\nimproperandinsufficientfundsfordefrayingthenecessaryexpenseofany\ngreat and civilised state, it remains that this expense must, the greater\npart of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the people contrib-\nuting a part of their own private revenue in order to make up a public\nrevenuetothesovereignorcommonwealth.\n638", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nPART THIRD\nG.ed.p825\nOf Taxes\n1771 [1] The private revenue of individuals, it has been shown in the first book of\nthis Inquiry, arises ultimately from three different sources: Rent, Profit,\nandWages. Everytaxmustfinallybepaidfromsomeoneorotherofthose\nthree different sorts of revenue, or from all of them indifferently. I shall\nendeavour to give the best account I can, first, of those taxes which, it is\nintended, should fall upon rent; secondly, of those which, it is intended,\nshould fall upon profit; thirdly, of those which, it is intended, should fall\nupon wages; and, fourthly, of those which, it is intended, should fall in-\ndifferently upon all those three different sources of private revenue. The\nparticular consideration of each of these four different sorts of taxes will\ndivide the second part of the present chapter into four articles, three of\nwhich will require several other subdivisions. Many of those taxes, it will\nappear from the following review, are not finally paid from the fund, or\nsourceofrevenue,uponwhichitwasintendedtheyshouldfall.\n1772 [2] BeforeIenterupontheexaminationofparticulartaxes,itisnecessary\ntopremisethefourfollowingmaximswithregardtotaxesingeneral.\n1773 [3] I.

Everytaxoughttobeleviedatthetime,orinthemanner,inwhichit\nismostlikelytobeconvenientforthecontributortopayit. Ataxuponthe\nrentoflandorofhouses,payableatthesametermatwhichsuchrentsare\nusually paid, is levied at the time when it is most likely to be convenient\nfor the contributor to pay; or, when he is most likely to have wherewithal\nto pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are\nall finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner that is very\nconvenient for him. He pays them by little and little, as he has occasion\nto buy the goods. As he is at liberty, too, either to buy, or not to buy, as\nhe pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable\ninconveniencyfromsuchtaxes.\n1776 [6] IV. Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep\nout of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what\nit brings into the public treasury of the state. A tax may either take out\nor keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings\ninto the public treasury, in the four following ways. First, the levying of\nit may require a great number of officers, whose salaries may eat up the\ngreater part of the produce of the tax, and whose perquisites may impose\nanother additional tax upon the people. Secondly, it may obstruct the in-\ndustrythepeople,anddiscouragethemfromapplyingtocertainbranches\nof business which might give maintenance and unemployment to great\nmultitudes. While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish, or\nperhaps destroy, some of the funds which might enable them more easily\ntodoso.

Allnationshave\nendeavoured, to the best of their judgment, to render their taxes as equal\nas they could contrive; as certain, as convenient to the contributor, both\nin the time and in the mode of payment, and, in proportion to the rev-\nenuewhichtheybroughttotheprince,aslittleburdensometothepeople.\nThefollowingshortreviewofsomeoftheprincipaltaxeswhichhavetaken G.ed.p828\nplace in different ages and countries will show that the endeavours of all\nnationshavenotinthisrespectbeenequallysuccessful.\nARTICLE I\nTaxesuponRent\nTaxesupontheRentofLand\n1778 [1] A tax upon the rent of land may either every district being valued at a\ncertain rent, be imposed according to a certain canon, which valuation is\nnotafterwardstobealtered, oritmaybeimposedinsuchamannerasto\nvary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to rise or fall\nwiththeimprovementordeclensionofitscultivation.\n1779 [2] Aland-taxwhich,likethatofGreatBritain,isassesseduponeachdis-\ntrict according to a certain invariable canon, though it should be equal\nat the timeof its first establishment, necessarily becomes unequalin pro-\ncess of time, according to the unequal degrees of improvement or neglect\nin the cultivation of the different parts of the country. In England, the\nvaluationaccordingtowhichthedifferentcountriesandparisheswereas-\nsessed to the land-tax by the 4th of William and Mary was very unequal\neven at its first establishment. This tax, therefore, so far offends against\nthe first of the four maxims above mentioned. It is perfectly agreeable to\nthe other three. It is perfectly certain. The time of payment for the tax,\nbeing the same as that for the rent, is as convenient as it can be to the\ncontributorthoughthelandlordisinallcasestherealcontributor,thetax\nis commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to\nallow it in the payment of the rent. This tax is levied by a much smal-\n641", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nler number of officers than any other which affords nearly the same rev-\nenue. Asthetax uponeachdistrictdoes not risewiththerise oftherent,\nthesovereigndoesnotshareintheprofitsofthelandlord\u2019simprovements.\nThoseimprovementssometimescontribute,indeed,tothedischargeofthe\nother landlords of the district. But the aggravation of the tax which may\nsometimes occasion upon a particular estate is always so very small that\nitnevercandiscouragethoseimprovements,norkeepdowntheproduceof\nthe land below what it would otherwise rise to. As it has no tendency to\ndiminish the quantity, it can have none to raise the price of that produce.\nIt does not obstruct the industry of the people. It subjects the landlord to G.ed.p829\nnootherinconveniencybesidestheunavoidableoneofpayingthetax.\n1780 [3] The advantage, however, which the landlord has derived from the in-\nvariable constancy of the valuation by which all the lands of Great Bri-\ntainareratedtotheland-tax,hasbeenprincipallyowingtosomecircum-\nstancesaltogetherextraneoustothenatureofthetax.\n1781 [4] It has been owing in part to the great prosperity of almost every part\nof the country, the rents of almost all the estates of Great Britain having,\nsincethetimewhenthisvaluationwasfirstestablished, beencontinually\nrising, and scarce any of them having fallen. The landlords, therefore,\nhave almost all gained the difference between the tax which they would\nhave paid according to the present rent of their estates, and that which\ntheyactuallypayaccordingtotheancientvaluation. Hadthestateofthe\ncountrybeendifferent,hadrentsbeengraduallyfallinginconsequenceof\nthedeclensionofcultivation,thelandlordswouldalmostallhavelostthis\ndifference. In the state of things which has happened to take place since\nthe revolution, the constancy of the valuation has been advantageous to\nthe landlord and hurtful to the sovereign. In a different state of things it\nmight have been advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the land-\nlord.\n1782 [5] As the tax is made payable in money, so the valuation of the land is\nexpressed in money. Since the establishment of this valuation the value\nof silver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in the\nstandard of the coin either as to weight or fineness. Had silver risen con-\nsiderably in its value, as it seems to have done in the course of the two\ncenturies which preceded the discovery of the mines of America, the con-\nstancyofthevaluationmighthaveprovedveryoppressivetothelandlord.\nHad silver fallen considerably in its value, as it certainly did for about a\ncentury at least after the discovery of those mines, the same constancy\nof valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the revenue of\nthe sovereign. Had any considerable alteration been made in the stand-\nard of the money, either by sinking the same quantity of silver to a lower\ndenomination, or by raising it to a higher; had an ounce of silver, for ex-\nample,insteadofbeingcoinedintofiveshillingsandtwopence,beencoined\neither into pieces which bore so low a denomination as two shillings and\nsevenpence, or into pieces which bore so high a one as ten shillings and\n642", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfourpence,itwouldintheonecasehavehurttherevenueoftheproprietor,\nintheotherthatofthesovereign.\n1783 [6] Incircumstances,therefore,somewhatdifferentfromthosewhichhave\nactually taken place, this constancy of valuation might have been a very\ngreat inconveniency, either to the contributors, or to the commonwealth. G.ed.p830\nIn the course of ages such circumstances, however, must, at some time or\nother, happen. But though empires, like all the other works of men, have\nall hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at immortality.

This practice is in most cases the expedient of a spendthrift,\nwhoforasumofreadymoneysellsafuturerevenueofmuchgreatervalue.\nIt is in most cases, therefore, hurtful to the landlords. It is frequently\nhurtful to the tenant, and it is always hurtful to the community. It fre-\nquently takes from the tenant so great a part of his capital, and thereby\ndiminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land, that he finds it more\ndifficult to pay a small rent than it would otherwise have been to pay a\ngreat one. Whatever diminishes his ability to cultivate, necessarily keeps\ndown, below what it would otherwise have been, the most important part\nof the revenue of the community. By rendering the tax upon such fines a\ngooddealheavierthanupontheordinaryrent,thishurtfulpracticemight\nbe discouraged, to the no small advantage of all the different parties con-\ncerned, of the landlord, of the tenant, of the sovereign, and of the whole\ncommunity.\n1790 [13] Someleasesprescribetothetenantacertainmodeofcultivationanda\ncertainsuccessionofcropsduringthewholecontinuanceofthelease.

Inordertoputthetradeofabuilderuponalevelwith\nothertrades,itisnecessarythatthisrentshouldbesufficient,first,topay\nhimthesameinterestwhichhewouldhavegotforhiscapitalifhehadlent\nit upon good security; and, secondly, to keep the house in constant repair,\nor,whatcomestothesamething,toreplace,withinacertaintermofyears,\nthe capital which had been employed in building it. The building-rent, or\nthe ordinary profit of building, is, therefore, everywhere regulated by the\nordinary interest of money. Where the market rate of interest is four per\ncent the rent of a house which, over and above paying the ground-rent,\naffords six or six and a half per cent upon the whole expense of building,\nmay perhaps afford a sufficient profit to the builder. Where the market\nrate of interest is five per cent, it may perhaps require seven or seven\nand a half per cent. If, in proportion to the interest of money, the trade\nof the builder affords at any time a much greater profit than this, it will\n651", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nsoondrawsomuchcapitalfromothertradesaswillreducetheprofittoits\nproperlevel. Ifitaffordsatanytimemuchlessthanthis,othertradeswill\nsoondrawsomuchcapitalfromitaswillagainraisethatprofit.\n1816 [3] Whatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what is\nsufficientforaffordingthisreasonableprofitnaturallygoestotheground-\nrent; and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the building\naretwo different persons, is, inmostcases, completelypaid totheformer.\nThis surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the house pays for\nsome real or supposed advantage of the situation. In country houses at\nadistancefromanygreattown, wherethereisplentyofgroundtochoose G.ed.p841\nupon,theground-rentisscarceanything,ornomorethanwhattheground\nwhich the house stands upon would pay if employed in agriculture. In\ncountry villas in the neighborhood of some great town, it is sometimes a\ngood deal higher, and the peculiar conveniency or beauty of situation is\ntherefrequentlyverywellpaidfor. Ground-rentsaregenerallyhighestin\nthe capital, and in those particular parts of it where there happens to be\nthe greatest demand for houses, whatever be the reason of that demand,\nwhetherfortradeandbusiness,forpleasureandsociety,orformerevanity\nandfashion.\n1817 [4] A tax upon house-rent, payable by the tenant and proportioned to the\nwhole rent of each house, could not, for any considerable time at least,\naffect the building-rent. If the builder did not get his reasonable profit,\nhe would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by raising the demand for\nbuilding, would in a short time bring back his profit to its proper level\nwiththatofothertrades. Neitherwouldsuchataxfallaltogetheruponthe\nground-rent; but it would divide itself in such a manner as to fall partly\nupontheinhabitantofthehouse,andpartlyupontheowneroftheground.\n1818 [5] Let us suppose, for example, that a particular person judges that he\ncan afford for house-rent an expense of sixty pounds a year; and let us\nsuppose, too, that a tax of four shillings in the pound, or of one-fifth, pay-\nable by the inhabitant, is laid upon house-rent. A house of sixty pounds\nrent will in this case cost him seventy-two pounds a year, which is twelve\npoundsmorethanhethinkshecanafford. Hewill,therefore,contenthim-\nself with a worse house, or a house of fifty pounds rent, which, with the\nadditionaltenpoundsthathemustpayforthetax,willmakeupthesum\nof sixty pounds a year, the expense which he judges he can afford; and in\norder to pay the tax he will give up a part of the additional conveniency\nwhichhemighthavehadfromahouseoftenpoundsayearmorerent. He\nwillgiveup,Isay,apartofthisadditionalconveniency;forhewillseldom\nbe obliged to give up the whole, but will, in consequence of the tax, get a\nbetter house for fifty pounds a year than he could have got if there had\nbeen no tax. For as a tax of this kind by taking away this particular com-\npetitor, must diminish the competition for houses of sixty pounds rent, so\nitmustlikewisediminishitforthoseoffiftypoundsrent,andinthesame\nmanner for those of all other rents, except the lowest rent, for which it\n652", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwouldforsometimeincreasethecompetition. Buttherentsofeveryclass\nof houses for which the competition was diminished would necessarily be\nmoreorlessreduced. Asnopartofthisreduction,however,could,forany\nconsiderable time at least, affect the building rent, the whole of it must G.ed.p842\nin the long-run necessarily fall upon the ground-rent. The final payment\nof this tax, therefore, would fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house,\nwho, in order to pay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his\nconveniency, and partly upon the owner of the ground, who, in order to\npay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what\nproportionthisfinalpaymentwouldbedividedbetweenthemitisnotper-\nhapsveryeasytoascertain. Thedivisionwouldprobablybeverydifferent\nindifferentcircumstances,andataxofthiskindmight,accordingtothose\ndifferent circumstances, affect very unequally both the inhabitant of the\nhouseandtheowneroftheground.\n1819 [6] Theinequalitywithwhichataxofthiskindmightfallupontheowners\nof different ground-rents would arise altogether from the accidental in-\nequality of this division. But the inequality with which it might fall upon\ntheinhabitantsofdifferenthouseswouldarisenotonlyfromthis,butfrom\nanother cause. The proportion of the expense of house-rent to the whole\nexpense of living is different in the different degrees of fortune. It is per-\nhaps highest in the highest degree, and it diminishes gradually through\ntheinferiordegrees,soasingeneraltobelowestinthelowestdegree. The\nnecessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it dif-\nficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in\ngettingit. Theluxuriesandvanitiesoflifeoccasiontheprincipalexpense\noftherich,andamagnificenthouseembellishesandsetsofftothebestad-\nvantagealltheotherluxuriesandvanitieswhichtheypossess. Ataxupon\nhouse-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and\nin this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very un-\nreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to\nthepublicexpense,notonlyinproportiontotheirrevenue,butsomething\nmorethaninthatproportion.\n1820 [7] The rent of houses, though it in some respects resembles the rent of\nland,isinonerespectessentiallydifferentfromit. Therentoflandispaid\nfor the use of a productive subject. The land which pays it produces it.\nThe rent of houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject. Neither\nthe house nor the ground which it stands upon produce anything. The\npersonwhopaystherent,therefore,mustdrawitfromsomeothersource\nof revenue distinct from the independent of this subject. A tax upon the\nrentofhouses,sofarasitfallsupontheinhabitants,mustbedrawnfrom\nthe same source as the rent itself, and must be paid from their revenue,\nwhether derived from the wages of labour, the profits of stock, or the rent\nof land. So far as it falls upon the inhabitants, it is one of those taxes\nwhichfall,notupononeonly,butindifferentlyuponallthethreedifferent\nsources of revenue, and is in every respect of the same nature as a tax\n653", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nupon any other sort of consumable commodities.

The valuation, indeed, according to which the houses\nare rated, though very unequal, is said to be always below the real value.\nWhen a house is rebuilt, improved, or enlarged, there is a new valuation,\nandthetaxisratedaccordingly.\n1828 [15] ThecontriversoftheseveraltaxeswhichinEnglandhave,atdifferent\ntimes, been imposed upon houses, seem to have imagined that there was\nsome great difficulty in ascertaining, with tolerable exactness, what was\nthe real rent of every house. They have regulated their taxes, therefore,\naccordingtosomemoreobviouscircumstances,suchastheyhadprobably\nimaginedwould,inmostcases,bearsomeproportiontotherent.\n1829 [16] The first tax of this kind was hearth-money, or a tax of two shillings\nupon every hearth. In order to ascertain how many hearths were in the G.ed.p846\nhouse, it was necessary that the tax-gatherer should enter every room in\nit. This odious visit rendered the tax odious.

Such taxes are, therefore, directly contrary to the first of the\nfour maxims above mentioned. They do not seem to offend much against\nanyoftheotherthree.\n1833 [20] The natural tendency of the window-tax, and of all other taxes upon\nhouses, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the less, it\nis evident, he can afford to pay for the rent.

Had it not been for the\ntax,rentswouldprobablyhaverisenstillhigher.\nARTICLE II\nTaxesuponProfit,orupontheRevenuearisingfrom\nStock\n1834 [1] The revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into two\nparts;thatwhichpaystheinterest,andwhichbelongstotheownerofthe\nstock,andthatsurpluspartwhichisoverandabovewhatisnecessaryfor\npayingtheinterest.\n1835 [2] This latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly. It\nis the compensation, and in most cases it is no more than a very moder-\nate compensation, for the risk and trouble of employing the stock. The\nemployermusthavethiscompensation, otherwisehecannot, consistently\nwith his own interest, continue the employment. If he was taxed directly,\ntherefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would be obliged either to\nraisetherateofhisprofit,ortochargethetaxupontheinterestofmoney;\nthatis,topaylessinterest. Ifheraisedtherateofhisprofitinproportion\nto the tax, the whole tax, though it might be advanced by him, would be\nfinallypaidbyoneorotheroftwodifferentsetsofpeople,accordingtothe\ndifferent ways in which he might employ the stock of which he had the\nmanagement. If he employed it as a farming stock in the cultivation of\nland, he could raise the rate of his profit only by retaining a greater por-\ntion,or,whatcomestothesamething,thepriceofagreaterportionofthe\nproduce of the land; and as this could be done only by a reduction of rent,\n657", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthefinalpaymentofthetaxwouldfalluponthelandlord. Ifheemployedit\nasamercantileormanufacturingstock,hecouldraisetherateofhisprofit\nonly by raising the price of his goods; in which case the final payment of\nthetaxwouldfallaltogetherupontheconsumersofthosegoods.

So\nfarashecouldnotrelievehimselffromthetaxintheoneway,hewouldbe\nobligedtorelievehimselfintheother.\n1836 [3] The interest of money seems at first sight a subject equally capable of\nbeing taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land, it is a net\nproducewhichremainsaftercompletelycompensatingthewholeriskand\ntroubleofemployingthestock. Asataxupontherentoflandcannotraise G.ed.p848\nrents; because the net produce which remains after replacing the stock\nof the farmer, together with his reasonable profit, cannot be greater after\nthe tax than before it, so, for the same reason, a tax upon the interest of\nmoneycouldnotraisetherateofinterest;thequantityofstockormoneyin\nthe country, like the quantity of land, being supposed to remain the same\nafterthetaxasbeforeit. Theordinaryrateofprofit,ithasbeenshownin\nthe first book, is everywhere regulated by the quantity of stock to be em-\nployedinproportiontothequantityoftheemployment,orofthebusiness\nwhich must be done by it. But the quantity of the employment, or of the\nbusiness to be done by stock, could neither be increased nor diminished\nby any tax upon the interest of money. If the quantity of the stock to be\nemployed, therefore, was neither increased nor diminished by it, the or-\ndinaryrateofprofitwouldnecessarilyremainthesame. Buttheportionof\nthisprofitnecessaryforcompensatingtheriskandtroubleoftheemployer\nwouldlikewiseremainthesame,thatriskandtroublebeinginnorespect\naltered.

Atfirstsight,therefore,theinterestofmoneyseemstobea\nsubjectasfittobetaxeddirectlyastherentofland.\n1837 [4] There are, however, two different circumstances which render the in-\nterestofmoneyamuchlesspropersubjectofdirecttaxationthantherent\nofland.\n1838 [5] First,thequantityandvalueofthelandwhichanymanpossessescan\nneverbeasecret,andcanalwaysbeascertainedwithgreatexactness. But\nthewholeamountofthecapitalstockwhichhepossessesisalmostalways\na secret, and can scarce ever be ascertained with tolerable exactness. It\nis liable, besides, to almost continual variations.

Theproprietoroflandisnecessarilyacitizenoftheparticular\ncountryinwhichhisestatelies. Theproprietorofstockisproperlyacitizen\nof the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country. G.ed.p849\nHe would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a\nvexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and\nwouldremovehisstocktosomeothercountrywherehecouldeithercarry\non his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease. By removing his\nstock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in\nthe country which he left. Stock cultivates land; stock employs labour. A\ntaxwhichtendedtodriveawaystockfromanyparticularcountrywouldso\nfartendtodryupeverysourceofrevenuebothtothesovereignandtothe\nsociety. Notonlytheprofitsofstock,buttherentoflandandthewagesof\nlabourwouldnecessarilybemoreorlessdiminishedbyitsremoval.\n1840 [7] The nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue\narisingfromstock,insteadofanysevereinquisitionofthiskind,havebeen\nobligedtocontentthemselveswithsomeveryloose,and,therefore,moreor\nlessarbitrary,estimation. Theextremeinequalityanduncertaintyofatax\nassessed in this manner can be compensated only by its extreme modera-\ntion,inconsequenceofwhicheverymanfindshimselfratedsoverymuch\nbelow his real revenue that he gives himself little disturbance though his\nneighbourshouldberatedsomewhatlower.\n1841 [8] By what is called the land-tax in England, it was intended that stock\nshould be taxed in the same proportion as land. When the tax upon land\nwas at four shillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the supposed rent, it\nwas intended that stock should be taxed at one-fifth of the supposed in-\nterest. Whenthepresentannualland-taxwasfirstimposed,thelegalrate\nofinterestwassixpercent. Everyhundredpoundsstock,accordingly,was\nsupposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings, the fifth part of six pounds.\nSincethelegalrateofinteresthasbeenreducedtofivepercenteveryhun-\ndred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at twenty shillings only. The\nsum to be raised by what is called the land-tax was divided between the\ncountry and the principal towns. The greater part of it was laid upon the\ncountry; and of what was laid upon the towns, the greater part was as-\nsessed upon the houses. What remained to be assessed upon the stock or G.ed.p850\ntradeofthetowns(forthestockuponthelandwasnotmeanttobetaxed)\nwas very much below the real value of that stock or trade. Whatever in-\nequalities, therefore, theremightbeintheoriginalassessmentgavelittle\ndisturbance. Every parish and district still continues to be rated for its\nland, its houses, and its stock, according to the original assessment; and\nthe almost universal prosperity of the country, which in most places has\nraised very much the value of all these, has rendered those inequalities\nof still less importance now. The rate, too, upon each district continuing\n659", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nalwaysthesame,theuncertaintyofthistaxsofarasitmightbeassessed\nupon the stock of any individual, has been very much diminished, as well\nas rendered of much less consequence. If the greater part of the lands\nof England are not rated to the land-tax at half their actual value, the\ngreaterpartofthestockofEnglandis,perhaps,scarceratedatthefiftieth\npartofitsactualvalue.

This tax is generally supposed to be paid with great\nfidelity.

They have no suspicion, it is said, that any of their\nfellow-citizens will deceive them. At Basel the principal revenue of the\nstate arises from a small custom upon goods exported. All the citizens\nmake oath that they will pay every three months all the taxes imposed\nby the law.

Every cit-\nizenassessedhimselfandpaidhistaxinthesamemannerasatHamburg,\nand it was in general supposed to have been paid with great fidelity. The G.ed.p852\npeople had at that time the greatest affection for their new government,\nwhich they had just established by a general insurrection. The tax was\nto be paid but once, in order to relieve the state in a particular exigency.\nIt was, indeed, too heavy to be permanent. In a country where the mar-\nket rate of interest seldom exceeds three per cent, a tax of two per cent\namountstothirteenshillingsandfourpenceinthepounduponthehighest\nnet revenue which is commonly drawn from stock.

But it is impossible that they should continue to do so for any\nconsiderable time; and if they did, the tax would ruin them so completely\nastorenderthemaltogetherincapableofsupportingthestate.\n1847 [14] The tax upon stock imposed by the Land-tax Bill in England, though\nit is proportioned to the capital, is not intended to diminish or take away\nany part of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the interest of\nmoney proportioned to that upon the rent of land, so that when the latter\nis at four shillings in the pound, the former may be at four shillings in\nthe pound too. The tax at Hamburg and the still more moderate tax of\nUnterwald and Zurich are meant, in the same manner, to be taxes, not\nupon the capital, but upon the interest or net revenue of stock. That of\nHollandwasmeanttobeataxuponthecapital.\nTaxesuponasProfitofparticularEmployments\n1848 [1] In some countries extraordinary taxes are imposed upon the profits of\nstock, sometimes when employed in particular branches of trade, and\nsometimeswhenemployedinagriculture.\n1849 [2] Of the former kind are in England the tax upon hawkers and pedlars,\nthat upon hackney coaches and chairs, and that which the keepers of ale-\nhouses pay for a licence to retail ale and spirituous liquors.

The great lords, though\nwillingtoassisthimuponparticularemergencies,refusedtosubjectthem-\nselves to any constant tax, and he was not strong enough to force them.\nThe occupiers of land all over Europe were, the greater part of them, ori-\n662", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nginallybondmen.

Otherswithoutacquiringtheproperty,obtainedleasesforterms\nof years of the lands which they occupied under their lord, and thus be-\ncame less dependent upon him. The great lords seem to have beheld the\ndegree of prosperity and independency which this inferior order of men\nhad thus come to enjoy with a malignant and contemptuous indignation,\nandwillinglyconsentedthatthesovereignshouldtaxthem. Insomecoun-\ntriesthistaxwasconfinedtothelandswhichwereheldinpropertybyan\nignoble tenure; and, in this case, the taille was said to be real.

Inothercountriesthetaxwaslaiduponthesupposedprofitsofall\nthosewhoheldinfarmorleaselandsbelongingtootherpeople,whatever\nmight be the tenure by which the proprietor held them; and in this case\nthe taille was said to be personal. In the greater part of those provinces\nof France which are called the Countries of Elections the taille is of this\nkind. The real taille, as it is imposed only upon a part of the lands of the\ncountry, is necessarily an unequal, but it is not always an arbitrary tax,\nthough it is so upon some occasions. The personal taille, as it is intended\ntobeproportionedtotheprofitsofacertainclassofpeoplewhichcanonly\nbeguessedat,isnecessarilybotharbitraryandunequal.\n1854 [7] In France the personal taille at present (1775) annually imposed upon\nthe twenty generalities called the Countries of Elections amounts to\n40,107,239 livres, 16 sous13. The proportion in which this sum is assessed\nupon those different provinces varies from year to year according to the\nreports which are made to the king\u2019s council concerning the goodness or\nbadness of the crops, as well as other circumstances which may either\nincrease or diminish their respective abilities to pay. Each generality it\ndividedintoacertainnumberofelections,andtheproportioninwhichthe\nsum imposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different\nelections varies likewise from year to year according to the reports made\nto the council concerning their respective abilities.

The tax, therefore, will never enable him to raise the price of his\nproduce so as to reimburse himself by throwing the final payment upon\nthe consumer. The farmer, however, must have his reasonable profit as\nwell as every other dealer, otherwise he must give up the trade. After\nthe imposition of a tax of this kind, he can get this reasonable profit only\nby paying less rent to the landlord.

Stamp-duties and duties of registration have\nfrequently been imposed likewise upon the deeds transferring property of\nall kinds from the dead to the living, and upon those transferring immov-\nablepropertyfromthelivingtotheliving,transactionswhichmighteasily\nhavebeentaxeddirectly.\n1863 [3] The Vicesima Hereditatum, the twentieth penny of inheritances im- G.ed.p859\nposed by Augustus upon the ancient Romans, was a tax upon the trans-\nferenceofpropertyfromthedeadtotheliving. DionCassius14,theauthor\nwho writes concerning it the least indistinctly, says that it was imposed\nuponallsuccessions,legacies,anddonationsincaseofdeath,exceptupon\nthosetothenearestrelationsandtothepoor.\n1864 [4] Of the same kind is the Dutch tax upon successions15. Collateral suc-\ncessions are taxed, according to the degree of relation, from five to thirty\npercentuponthewholevalueofthesuccession. Testamentarydonations,\nor legacies to collaterals, are subject to the like duties. Those from hus-\nbandto wife, or fromwifeto husband, to thefiftiethpenny. TheLuctuosa\nHereditas, the mournful succession of ascendants to descendants, to the\ntwentieth penny only. Direct successions, or those of descendants to as-\ncendants, pay no tax. The death of a father, to such of his children as live\nin the same house with him, is seldom attended with any increase, and\nfrequentlywithaconsiderablediminutionofrevenue,bythelossofhisin-\ndustry, of his office, or of some life-rent estate of which he may have been\nin possession. That tax would be cruel and oppressive which aggravated\ntheirlossbytakingfromthemanypartofhissuccession. Itmay,however,\nsometimes be otherwise with those children who, in the language of the\nRoman law, are said to be emancipated; in that of the Scotch law, to be\nforisfamiliated; that is, who have received their portion, have got famil-\nies of their own, and are supported by funds separate and independent of\nthose of their father. Whatever part of his succession might come to such\nchildren would be a real addition to their fortune, and might therefore,\nperhaps, without more inconveniency than what attends all duties of this\nkind,beliabletosometax.\n1865 [5] The casualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the transference of\nland,bothfromthedeadtotheliving,andfromthelivingtotheliving.

The demand for labour, according as it happens to be either\nincreasing,stationary,ordeclining,ortorequireanincreasing,stationary,\nor declining population, regulates the subsistence of the labourer, and de-\nterminesinwhatdegreeitshallbe,eitherliberal,moderate,orscanty. The\nordinary or average price of provisions determines the quantity of money\nwhichmustbepaidtotheworkmaninordertoenablehim,oneyearwith\nanother, to purchase this liberal, moderate, or scanty subsistence. While\nthe demand for labour and the price of provisions, therefore, remain the\nsame, a direct tax upon the wages of labour can have no other effect than\ntoraisethemsomewhathigherthanthetax. Letussuppose,forexample,\nthatinaparticularplacethedemandforlabourandthepriceofprovisions\nwere such as to render ten shillings a week the ordinary wages of labour,\nand that a tax of one-fifth, or four shillings in the pound, was imposed\nuponwages. Ifthedemandforlabourandthepriceofprovisionsremained\nthesame,itwouldstillbenecessarythatthelabourershouldinthatplace\nearn such a subsistence as could be bought only for ten shillings a week\nfree wages. But in order to leave him such free wages after paying such\na tax, the price of labour must in that place soon rise, not to twelve shil-\nlings a week only, but to twelve and sixpence; that is, in order to enable\n671", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nhimtopayataxofone-fifth,hiswagesmustnecessarilysoonrise,notone-\nfifthpartonly,butone-fourth. Whateverwastheproportionofthetax,the\nwages of labour must in all cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in\na higher proportion. If the tax, for example, was one-tenth, the wages of\nlabourmustnecessarilysoonrise,notone-tenthpartonly,butone-eighth.\n1880 [2] A direct tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer\nmightperhapspayitoutofhishand,couldnotproperlybesaidtobeeven\nadvanced by him; at least if tile demand for labour and the average price\nof provisions remained the same after the tax as before it. In all such G.ed.p865\ncases, not only the tax but something more than the tax would in reality\nbeadvancedbythepersonwhoimmediatelyemployedhim. Thefinalpay-\nment would in different cases fall upon different persons. The rise which\nsuch a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing labour would\nbeadvancedbythemastermanufacturer,whowouldbothbeentitledand\nobliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his goods. The fi-\nnal payment of this rise of wages, therefore, together with the additional\nprofitofthemastermanufacturer,wouldfallupontheconsumer. Therise\nwhich such a tax might occasion in the wages of country labour would be\nadvanced by the farmer, who, in order to maintain the same number of\nlabourers as before, would be obliged to employ a greater capital. In or-\nder to get back this greater capital, together with the ordinary profits of\nstock,itwouldbenecessarythatheshouldretainalargerportion,orwhat\ncomes to the same thing, the price of a larger portion, of the produce of\nthe land, and consequently that he should pay less rent to the landlord.\nThe final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, would in this case fall\nupon the landlord, together with the additional profit of the farmer who\nhad advanced it. In all cases a direct tax upon the wages of labour must,\ninthelong-run,occasionbothagreaterreductionintherentofland,anda\ngreaterriseinthepriceofmanufacturedgoods,thanwouldhavefollowed\nfromtheproperassessmentofasumequaltotheproduceofthetaxpartly\nupontherentofland,andpartlyuponconsumablecommodities.\n1881 [3] If direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occasioned a\nproportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally oc-\ncasioned a considerable fall in the demand for labour. The declension of\nindustry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the\nannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthecountry,havegenerallybeen\nthe effects of such taxes. In consequence of them, however, the price of\nlabourmustalwaysbehigherthanitotherwisewouldhavebeenintheac-\ntualstateofthedemand: andthisenhancementofprice,togetherwiththe\nprofitofthosewhoadvanceit,mustalwaysbefinallypaidbythelandlords\nandconsumers.\n1882 [4] A tax upon the wages of country labour does not raise the price of the\nrude produce of land in proportion to the tax, for the same reason that a\ntaxuponthefarmer\u2019sprofitdoesnotraisethatpriceinthatproportion.\n1883 [5] Absurd and destructive as such taxes are, however, they take place in\n672", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmany countries.

Theofficersoftheking\u2019scourt,\nthe judges and other officers in the superior courts of justice, the officers\nof the troops, etc., are assessed in the first manner.

A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking,\nnot a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very\ncomfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through\nthe greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed\ntoappearinpublicwithoutalinenshirt,thewantofwhichwouldbesup-\nposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed,\nnobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the\nsame manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England.\nThe poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear\nin public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a neces-\nsaryoflifetothelowestorderofmen;butnottothesameorderofwomen,\nwhomay,withoutanydiscredit,walkaboutbarefooted. InFrancetheyare\nnecessariesneithertomennortowomen,thelowestrankofbothsexesap-\npearingtherepublicly,withoutanydiscredit,sometimesinwoodenshoes,\nand sometimes barefooted.

Such a tax must, therefore, occasion a\nriseinthewagesoflabourproportionabletothisriseofprice.\n1899 [5] It is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life operates exactly in\nthe same manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The labourer,\nthough he may pay it out of his hand, cannot, for any considerable time\nat least, be properly said even to advance it. It must always in the long-\nrun be advanced to him by his immediate employer in the advanced rate\nof his wages. His employer, if he is a manufacturer, will charge upon the\nprice of his goods this rise of wages, together with a profit; so that the\nfinal payment of the tax, together with this overcharge, will fall upon the\nconsumer.

A tax upon tobacco, for example,\nthough a luxury of the poor as well as of the rich, will not raise wages.\nThough it is taxed in England at three times, and in France at fifteen\ntimes its original price, those high duties seem to have no effect upon the\nwages of labour. The same thing may be said of the taxes upon tea and\nsugar, which in England and Holland have become luxuries of the lowest\nranksofpeople,andofthoseuponchocolate,whichinSpainissaidtohave\nbecomeso. ThedifferenttaxeswhichinGreatBritainhaveinthecourseof G.ed.p872\nthepresentcenturybeenimposeduponspirituousliquorsarenotsupposed\nto have had any effect upon the wages of labour.

Allthepoor,in-\n21[Smith]SeeBookI.Chap.8.\n677", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ndeed,arenotsoberandindustrious,andthedissoluteanddisorderlymight\ncontinue to indulge themselves in the use of such commodities after this\nrise of price in the same manner as before without regarding the distress\nwhich this indulgence might bring upon their families. Such disorderly\npersons, however, seldom rear up numerous families, their children gen-\nerally perishing from neglect, mismanagement, and the scantiness or un-\nwholesomeness of their food. If by the strength of their constitution they\nsurvive the hardships to which the bad conduct of their parents exposes\nthem, yet the example of that bad conduct commonly corrupts their mor-\nals,sothat,insteadofbeingusefultosocietybytheirindustry,theybecome\npublic nuisances by their vices and disorders.

Taxes upon necessar-\nies, by raising the wages of labour, necessarily tend to raise the price of\nall manufactures, and consequently to diminish the extent of their sale\nand consumption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the consumers\nof the commodities taxed without any retribution. They fall indifferently\nupon every species of revenue, the wages of labour, the profits of stock,\nand the rent of land. Taxes upon necessaries, so far as they affect the la-\nbouringpoor,arefinallypaid,partlybylandlordsinthediminishedrentof\ntheirlands,andpartlybyrichconsumers,whetherlandlordsorothers,in\ntheadvancedpriceofmanufacturedgoods,andalwayswithaconsiderable\novercharge. The advanced price of such manufactures as are real neces-\nsaries of life, and are destined for the consumption of the poor, of coarse\nwoollens, for example, must be compensated to the poor by a further ad-\nvancement of their wages. The middling and superior ranks of people,\nif they understand their own interest, ought always to oppose all taxes\nupon the necessaries of life, as well as all direct taxes upon the wages of\nlabour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether\nupon themselves, and always with a considerable overcharge. They fall\nheaviest upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in that\nof landlords by the reduction of their rent, and in that of rich consumers\nby the increase of their expense. The observation of Sir Matthew Decker,\nthat certain taxes are, in the price of certain goods, sometimes repeated\nand accumulated four or five times, is perfectly just with regard to taxes\n678", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nuponthenecessariesoflife. Inthepriceofleather, forexample, youmust\npaynotonlyforthetaxupontheleatherofyourownshoes,butforapart\nof that upon those of the shoemaker and the tanner.

It was\ntaxed among the Romans, and it is so at present in, I believe, every part\nofEurope. Thequantityannuallyconsumedbyanyindividualissosmall,\nand may be purchased so gradually, that nobody, it seems to have been\nthought, could feel very sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is in\nEnglandtaxedatthreeshillingsandfourpenceabushel-aboutthreetimes\ntheoriginalpriceofthecommodity. Insomeothercountriesthetaxisstill\nhigher. Leather is a real necessary of life. The use of linen renders soap\nsuch. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles are a neces-\nsary instrument of trade. Leather and soap are in Great Britain taxed at\nthree halfpence a pound, candles at a penny; taxes which, upon the ori-\nginal price of leather, may amount to about eight or ten per cent; upon\nthatofsoaptoabouttwentyorfive-and-twentypercent;anduponthatof\ncandles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent; taxes which, though lighter\nthanthatuponsalt,arestillveryheavy. Asallthosefourcommoditiesare\nreal necessaries of life, such heavy taxes upon them must increase some-\nwhattheexpenseofthesoberandindustriouspoor,andmustconsequently\nraisemoreorlessthewagesoftheirlabour.\n1906 [12] In a country where the winters are so cold as in Great Britain, fuel\nis, during that season, in the strictest sense of the word, a necessary of\nlife, not only for the purpose of dressing victuals, but for the comfortable\nsubsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within doors;\nand coals are the cheapest of all fuel. The price of fuel has so important\naninfluenceuponthatoflabourthatalloverGreatBritainmanufactures\nhave confined themselves principally to the coal countries, other parts of\nthecountry,onaccountofthehighpriceofthisnecessaryarticle,notbeing\nable to work so cheap. In some manufactures, besides, coal is a necessary\ninstrument of trade, as in those of glass, iron, and all other metals. If\na bounty could in any case be reasonable, it might perhaps be so upon\nthe transportation of coals from those parts of the country in which they\nabound to those in which they are wanted. But the legislature, instead of\na bounty, has imposed a tax of three shillings and three-pence a ton upon G.ed.p875\ncoal carried coastways, which upon most sorts of coal is more than sixty\nper cent of the original price at the coal-pit. Coals carried either by land\norbyinlandnavigationpaynoduty.

There\nmay, therefore, be good reasons for continuing them. The bounty upon\nthe exportation of corn, so far as it tends in the actual state of tillage to\nraise the price of that necessary article, produces all the like bad effects,\nand instead of affording any revenue, frequently occasions a very great\nexpense to government. The high duties upon the importation of foreign\ncorn, which in years of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, and the\nabsolute prohibition of the importation either of live cattle or of salt pro-\nvisions, which takes place in the ordinary state of the law, and which, on\naccount of the scarcity, is at present suspended for a limited time with\nregard to Ireland and the British plantations, have all the bad effects of\ntaxesuponthenecessariesoflife,andproducenorevenuetogovernment.\nNothingseemsnecessaryfortherepealofsuchregulationsbuttoconvince\nthepublicofthefutilityofthatsysteminconsequenceofwhichtheyhave\nbeenestablished.\n1908 [14] Taxesuponthenecessariesoflifearemuchhigherinmanyothercoun-\ntries than in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground at\nthe mill, and upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many\ncountries. In Holland the money price of the bread consumed in towns is\nsupposed to be doubled by means of such taxes. In lieu of a part of them,\nthe people who live in the country pay every year so much a head accord-\ningtothesortofbreadtheyaresupposedtoconsume. Thosewhoconsume\nwheaten bread pay three guilders fifteen stivers; about six shillings and\nninepence halfpenny. These, and some other taxes of the same kind, by\nraising the price of labour, are said to have ruined the greater part of the\nmanufacturesofHolland22. Similartaxes,thoughnotquitesoheavy,take G.ed.p876\nplace in the Milanese, in the states of Genoa, in the duchy of Modena, in\nthe duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, and in the ecclesiastical\nstate.

The different\ntaxes which affect houses are certainly more conveniently paid by mod-\nerate annual payments than by a heavy tax of equal value upon the first\nbuildingorsaleofthehouse.\n1912 [18] It was the well-known proposal of Sir Matthew Decker that all com-\nmodities,eventhoseofwhichtheconsumptioniseitherimmediateorvery\nspeedy,shouldbetaxedinthismanner,thedealeradvancingnothing,but\nthe consumer paying a certain annual sum for the licence to consume\ncertain goods. The object of his scheme was to promote all the differ-\nent branches of foreign trade, particularly the carrying trade, by taking\naway all duties upon importation and exportation, and thereby enabling\nthe merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of\ngoods and the freight of ships, no part of either being diverted towards\nthe advancing of taxes. The project, however, of taxing, in this manner,\ngoodsofimmediateorspeedyconsumptionseemsliabletothefourfollow-\ning very important objections. First, the tax would be more unequal, or\nnot so well proportioned to the expense and consumption of the different\ncontributors as in the way in which it is commonly imposed. The taxes\nupon ale, wine, and spirituous liquors, which are advanced by the deal-\ners, are finally paid by the different consumers exactly in proportion to\ntheir respective consumption. But if the tax were to be paid by purchas-\ning a licence to drink those liquors, the sober would, in proportion to his\nconsumption, betaxedmuch more heavilythanthedrunkenconsumer. A\n681", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nfamilywhichexercisedgreathospitalitywouldbetaxedmuchmorelightly\nthanonewhoentertainedfewerguests. Secondly,thismodeoftaxation,by\npaying for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to consume certain\ngoods,woulddiminishverymuchoneoftheprincipalconveniencesoftaxes G.ed.p878\nupongoodsofspeedyconsumptionthepiecemealpayment. Inthepriceof\nthreepence halfpenny, which is at present paid for a pot of porter, the dif-\nferent taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the extraordinary\nprofit which the brewer charges for having advanced them, may perhaps\namount to about three halfpence. If a workman can conveniently spare\nthose three halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he cannot, he contents\nhimself with a pint, and, as a penny saved is a penny got, he thus gains\na farthing by his temperance. He pays the tax piecemeal as he can afford\nto pay it, and when he can afford to pay it, and every act of payment is\nperfectly voluntary, and what he can avoid if he chooses to do so. Thirdly,\nsuch taxes would operate less as sumptuary laws. When the licence was\nonce purchased, whether the purchaser drank much or drank little, his\ntax would be the same. Fourthly, if a workman were to pay all at once,\nby yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly payments, a tax equal to what he at\npresent pays, with little or no inconveniency, upon all the different pots\nand pints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time, the sum\nmight frequently distress him very much. This mode of taxation, there-\nfore, it seems evident, could never, without the most grievous oppression,\nproduce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode\nwithout any oppression. In several countries, however, commodities of an\nimmediate or very speedy consumption are taxed in this manner. In Hol-\nland people pay so much a head for a licence to drink tea. I have already\nmentionedataxuponbread,which,sofarasitisconsumedinfarm-houses\nandcountryvillages,isthereleviedinthesamemanner.\n1913 [19] The duties of excise are imposed briefly upon goods of home produce\ndestined for home consumption.

It was natural, therefore, that those of the\nformershouldbetaxedmoreheavilythanthoseofthelatter. Thisdistinc-\ntion between the duties upon aliens and those upon English merchants,\nwhich was begun from ignorance, has been continued from the spirit of\nmonopoly,orinordertogiveourownmerchantsanadvantagebothinthe\nhomeandintheforeignmarket.\n1916 [22] With this distinction, the ancient duties of customs were imposed\nequally upon all sorts of goods, necessaries as well as luxuries, goods ex-\nported as well as goods imported. Why should the dealers in one sort of\ngoods, it seems to have been thought, be more favoured than those in an-\nother? or why should the merchant exporter be more favoured than the\nmerchantimporter?\n1917 [23] The ancient customs were divided into three branches. The first, and\nperhaps the most ancient of all those duties, was that upon wool and\nleather. It seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation duty.\nWhen the woollen manufacture came to be established in England, lest\nthe king should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the exporta-\ntion of woollen cloths, a like duty was imposed upon them. The other two\nbranches were, first, a duty upon wine, which, being imposed at so much\na ton, was called a tonnage, and, secondly, a duty upon all other goods,\nwhich, being imposed at so much a pound of their supposed value, was\ncalled a poundage. In the forty-seventh year of Edward III a duty of six-\npence in the pound was imposed upon all goods exported and imported,\nexcept wools, wool-fells, leather, and wines, which were subject to partic-\nular duties.

The trade in the commodities not taxed, by far the\ngreatest number, would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to and\nfrom all parts of the world with every possible advantage. Among those\ncommoditieswouldbecomprehendedallthenecessariesoflifeandallthe\nmaterials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the necessar-\nies of life reduced their average money price in the home market it would\nreduce the money price of labour, but without reducing in any respect its\nreal recompense. The value of money is in proportion to the quantity of G.ed.p886\nthenecessariesoflifewhichitwillpurchase. Thatofthenecessariesoflife\nis altogether independent of the quantity of money which can be had for\nthem. Thereductioninthemoneypriceoflabourwouldnecessarilybeat-\ntendedwithaproportionableoneinthatofallhomemanufactures,which\nwould thereby gain some advantage in all foreign markets. The price of\nsome manufactures would be reduced in a still greater proportion by the\nfree importation of the raw materials. If raw silk could be imported from\nChina and Indostan duty free, the silk manufacturers in England could\ngreatly undersell those of both France and Italy. There would be no occa-\nsiontoprohibittheimportationofforeignsilksandvelvets. Thecheapness\nof their goods would secure to our own workmen not only the possession\nof the home, but a very great command of the foreign market. Even the\ntrade in the commodities taxed would be carried on with much more ad-\nvantage than at present. If those commodities were delivered out of the\npublicwarehouseforforeignexportation,beinginthiscaseexemptedfrom\nall taxes, the trade in them would be perfectly free. The carrying trade\nin all sorts of goods would under this system enjoy every possible advant-\nage. If those commodities were delivered out for home consumption, the\n688", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nimporter not being obliged to advance the tax till he had an opportunity\nof selling his goods, either to some dealer, or to some consumer, he could\nalways afford to sell them cheaper than if he had been obliged to advance\nit at the moment of importation. Under the same taxes, the foreign trade\nof consumption even in the taxed commodities might in this manner be\ncarriedonwithmuchmoreadvantagethanitcanbeatpresent.\n1934 [40] It was the object of the famous excise scheme of Sir Robert Walpole to\nestablish, with regard to wine and tobacco, a system not very unlike that\nwhich is here proposed. But though the bill which was then brought into\nParliament comprehended those two commodities, only it was generally\nsupposedtobemeantasanintroductiontoamoreextensiveschemeofthe\nsame kind, faction, combined with the interest of smuggling merchants,\nraised so violent, though so unjust, a clamour against that bill, that the\nministerthoughtpropertodropit,andfromadreadofexcitingaclamour\nofthesamekind,noneofhissuccessorshavedaredtoresumetheproject.\n1935 [41] The duties upon foreign luxuries imported for home consumption,\nthough they sometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of\nmiddlingormorethanmiddlingfortune. Suchare,forexample,theduties\nuponforeignwines,uponcoffee,chocolate,tea,sugar,etc.\n1936 [42] The duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home produce destined for G.ed.p887\nhome consumption fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks in propor-\ntiontotheirrespectiveexpense. Thepoorpaythedutiesuponmalt,hops,\nbeer, and ale, upon their own consumption: the rich, upon both their own\nconsumptionandthatoftheirservants.\n1937 [43] Thewholeconsumptionoftheinferiorranksofpeople,orofthosebelow\nthe middling rank, it must be observed, is in every country much greater,\nnot only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling and of those\nabovethemiddlingrank. Thewholeexpenseoftheinferiorismuchgreater\nthan that of the superior ranks. In the first place, almost the whole cap-\nital of every country is annually distributed among the inferior ranks of\npeople as the wages of productive labour. Secondly, a great part of the\nrevenue arising from both the rent of land and the profits of stock is an-\nnuallydistributedamongthesamerankinthewagesandmaintenanceof\nmenial servants, and other unproductive labourers. Thirdly, some part of\nthe profits of stock belongs to the same rank as a revenue arising from\nthe employment of their small capitals. The amount of the profits an-\nnually made by small shopkeepers, tradesmen, and retailers of all kinds\nis everywhere very considerable, and makes a very considerable portion\nof the annual produce. Fourthly, and lastly, some part even of the rent\nof land belongs to the same rank, a considerable part of those who are\nsomewhat below the middling rank, and a small part even to the lowest\nrank, common labourers sometimes possessing in property an acre or two\nof land. Though the expense of those inferior ranks of people, therefore,\ntaking them individually, is very small, yet the whole mass of it, taking\nthem collectively, amounts always to by much the largest portion of the\n689", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwhole expense of the society; what remains of the annual produce of the\nland and labour of the country for the consumption of the superior ranks\nbeingalwaysmuchless,notonlyinquantity,butinvalue. Thetaxesupon\nexpense, therefore, which fall chiefly upon that of the superior ranks of\npeople, upon the smaller portion of the annual produce, are likely to be\nmuch less productive than either those which fall indifferently upon the\nexpense of all ranks, or even those which fall chiefly upon that of the in-\nferiorranks;thaneitherthosewhichfallindifferentlyuponthewholean-\nnualproduce,orthosewhichfallchieflyuponthelargerportionofit. The\nexcise upon the materials and manufacture of home-made fermented and\nspirituous liquors is accordingly, of all the different taxes upon expense,\nby far the most productive; and this branch of the excise falls very much,\nperhaps principally, upon the expense of the common people. In the year\nwhich ended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce of this branch of G.ed.p888\ntheexciseamountedto3,341,837l.9s.9d.\n1938 [44] It must always be remembered, however, that it is the luxurious and\nnot the necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people that ought ever\nto be taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their necessary expense\nwould fall altogether upon the superior ranks of people; upon the smaller\nportion of the annual produce, and not upon the greater.

It is not, indeed, very common to distil for private use, though it is\ndonesometimes. Butinthecountrymanymiddlingandalmostallrichand\ngreatfamiliesbrewtheirownbeer. Theirstrongbeer,therefore,coststhem\neight shillings a barrel less than it costs the common brewer, who must\nhavehisprofituponthetaxaswellasuponalltheotherexpensewhichhe\nadvances. Such families, therefore, must drink their beer at least nine or\nten shillings a barrel cheaper than any liquor of the same quality can be\ndrunk by the common people, to whom it is everywhere more convenient\nto buy their beer, by little and little, from the brewery or the alehouse.\nMalt, in the same manner, that is made for the use of a private family\nis not liable to the visit or examination of the tax-gatherer; but in this\n690", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncase the family must compound at seven shillings and sixpence a head\nfor the tax. Seven shillings and sixpence are equal to the excise upon ten\nbushels of malt- a quantity fully equal to what all the different members\nof any sober family, men, women, and children, are at an average likely\nto consume.

But a change of system which reduced the\nduties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale from twenty-four\nand twenty-five shillings to eighteen shillings would be more likely to in-\ncrease than diminish that demand. The rent and profit of barley land,\nbesides, must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile and\nequally well-cultivated land. If they were less, some part of the barley\nlandwouldsoonbeturnedtosomeotherpurpose;andiftheyweregreater,\nmore land would soon be turned to the raising of barley.

The sovereign, who is altogether unac-\ncountable, has in many countries assumed to himself the administration\n695", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nof those duties, and though he has in most cases enhanced very much the\nduty, he has in many entirely neglected the application. If the turnpike\ntolls of Great Britain should ever become one of the resources of govern-\nment, we may learn, by the example of many other nations, what would\nprobably be the consequence. Such tolls are no doubt finally paid by the\nconsumer;buttheconsumerisnottaxedinproportiontohisexpensewhen\nhepays, notaccordingtothevalue, butaccordingtothebulkorweightof\nwhat he consumes.

G.ed.p895\nAs every man\u2019s humour regulates the degree of his consumption, every\nman contributes rather according to his humour than in proportion to his\nrevenue; the profuse contribute more, the parsimonious less, than their\nproper proportion.

Where such taxes, therefore, are\nproperly assessed, and upon proper commodities, they are paid with less\ngrumbling than any other. When they are advanced by the merchant or\nmanufacturer, the consumer, who finally pays them, soon comes to con-\nfound them with the price of the commodities, and almost forgets that he\npaysanytax.\n1953 [59] Suchtaxesareormaybeperfectlycertain,ormaybeassessedsoasto\nleavenodoubtconcerningeitherwhatoughttobepaid,orwhenitoughtto G.ed.p896\nbepaid; concerningeitherthequantityorthetimeofpayment. Whatever\nuncertainty there may sometimes be, either in the duties of customs in\nGreat Britain, or in other duties of the same kind in other countries, it\ncannot arise from the nature of those duties, but from the inaccurate or\nunskilfulmannerinwhichthelawthatimposesthemisexpressed.\n1954 [60] Taxesuponluxuriesgenerallyare,andalwaysmaybe,paidpiecemeal,\nor in proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the goods\nuponwhichtheyareimposed.

Upon the whole, such taxes,\nare, perhaps, as agreeable to the three first of the four general maxims\nconcerningtaxationasanyother.

Theyseemtodothisinallthefourdifferent\nwaysinwhichitispossibletodoit.\n1956 [62] First, the levying of such taxes, even when imposed in the most judi-\nciousmanner,requiresagreatnumberofcustom-houseandexciseofficers,\nwhosesalariesandperquisitesarearealtaxuponthepeople,whichbrings\nnothing into the treasury of the state. This expense, however, it must be\nacknowledged,ismoremoderateinGreatBritainthaninmostothercoun-\ntries. In the year which ended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce\nofthedifferentduties,underthemanagementofthecommissionersofex-\ncise in England, amounted to 5,507,308l.18s.81d., which was levied at an\n4\nexpense of little more than five and a half per cent. From this gross pro-\nduce, however, there must be deducted what was paid away in bounties\nanddrawbacksupontheexportationofexcisablegoods,whichwillreduce\n697", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe net produce below five millions25. The levying of the salt duty, an\nexcise duty, but under a different management, is much more expensive.\nThenetrevenueofthecustomsdoesnotamounttotwomillionsandahalf,\nwhich is levied at an expense of more than ten per cent in the salaries of\nofficers, and other incidents. But the perquisites of custom-house officers\nareeverywheremuchgreaterthantheirsalaries;atsomeportsmorethan G.ed.p897\ndouble or triple those salaries. If the salaries of officers, and other incid-\nents, therefore, amount to more than ten per cent upon the net revenue\nofthecustoms,thewholeexpenseoflevyingthatrevenuemayamount,in\nsalaries and perquisites together, to more than twenty or thirty per cent.\nThe officers of excise receive few or no perquisites, and the administra-\ntion of that branch of the revenue, being of more recent establishment, is\nin general less corrupted than that of the customs, into which length of\ntimehasintroducedandauthorizedmanyabuses. Bycharginguponmalt\nthe whole revenue which is at present levied by the different duties upon\nmaltandmaltliquors,asaving,itissupposed,ofmorethanfiftythousand\npounds might be made in the annual expense of the excise. By confining\nthedutiesofcustomstoafewsortsofgoods,andbylevyingthosedutiesac-\ncordingtotheexciselaws,amuchgreatersavingmightprobablybemade\nintheannualexpenseofthecustoms.\n1957 [63] Secondly, such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or discour-\nagement to certain branches of industry. As they always raise the price\nof the commodity taxed, they so far discourage its consumption, and con-\nsequentlyitsproduction. Ifitisacommodityofhomegrowthormanufac-\nture, less labour comes to be employed in raising and producing it. If it is\na foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this manner the price,\nthe commodities of the same kind which are made at home may thereby,\nindeed, gain some advantage in the home market, and a greater quantity\nof domestic industry may thereby be turned toward preparing them. But\nthough this rise of price in a foreign commodity may encourage domestic\nindustryinoneparticularbranch,itnecessarilydiscouragesthatindustry\ninalmosteveryother. ThedearertheBirminghammanufacturerbuyshis\nforeign wine, the cheaper he necessarily sells that part of his hardware\nwith which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which he\nbuysit. Thatpartofhishardware,therefore,becomesoflessvaluetohim,\nandhehaslessencouragementtoworkatit. Thedearertheconsumersin\none country pay for the surplus produce of another, the cheaper they ne-\ncessarily sell that part of their own surplus produce with which, or, what\ncomestothe same thing, withthepriceof which theybuyit. Thatpartof\ntheir own surplus produce becomes of less value to them, and they have\nless encouragement to increase its quantity. All taxes upon consumable\ncommodities, therefore, tend to reduce the quantity of productive labour\nbelow what it otherwise would be, either in preparing the commodities\n25[Smith] The net produce of that year, after deducting all expenses and allowances,\namountedto4,975,652l.19s.6d.\n698", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ntaxed, if they are home commodities, or in preparing those with which\nthey are purchased, if they are foreign commodities.

Thisobservation,however,mayveryprobablybethemeresuggestion\nof fraudulent dealers whose smuggling is either prevented or detected by\ntheirdiligence.\n1960 [66] The inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in some degree in-\nseparablefromtaxesuponconsumablecommodities,fallaslightuponthe\npeople of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which the\ngovernmentisnearlyasexpensive. Ourstateisnotperfect,andmightbe\nmended,butitisasgoodorbetterthanthatofmostofourneighbours.\n1961 [67] In consequence of the notion that duties upon consumable goods were\ntaxes upon the profits of merchants, those duties have, in some coun-\ntries, been repeated upon every successive sale of the goods. If the profits\nof the merchant importer or merchant manufacturer were taxed, equal-\nity seemed to require that those of all the middle buyers who intervened\nbetween either of them and the consumer should likewise be taxed. The\nfamous alcavala of Spain seems to have been established upon this prin-\nciple. It was at first a tax of ten per cent, afterwards of fourteen per cent,\nandisatpresentofonlysixpercentuponthesaleofeverysortofproperty\nwhethermovableorimmovable,anditisrepeatedeverytimetheproperty\nis sold26. The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue officers\nsufficienttoguardthetransportationofgoods,notonlyfromoneprovince\nto another, but from one shop to another. It subjects not only the dealers\nin some sorts of goods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manu-\nfacturer, every merchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visits and ex-\namination of the tax-gatherers. Through the greater part of a country in\nwhichataxofthiskindisestablishednothingcanbeproducedfordistant\nsale. Theproduceofeverypartofthecountrymustbeproportionedtothe\nconsumption of the neighborhood. It is to the alcavala, accordingly, that\nUstaritz imputes the ruin of the manufactures of Spain. He might have G.ed.p900\nimputed to it likewise the declension of agriculture, it being imposed not\nonlyuponmanufactures,butupontherudeproduceoftheland.\n1962 [68] In the kingdom of Naples there is a similar tax of three per cent upon\nthe value of all contracts, and consequently upon that of all contracts of\nsale. ItisbothlighterthantheSpanishtax,andthegreaterpartoftowns\nand parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it.

The Neapolitan tax,\ntherefore,isnotnearsoruinousastheSpanishone.\n1963 [69] Theuniformsystemoftaxationwhich,withafewexceptionsofnogreat\nconsequence, takes place in all the different parts of the United Kingdom\nof Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the country, the inland\nand coasting trade, almost entirely free. The inland trade is almost per-\nfectly free, and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end of\nthekingdomtotheotherwithoutrequiringanypermitorlet-pass,without\nbeing subject to question, visit, or examination from the revenue officers.\nThere are a few exceptions, but they are such as can give no interruption\ntoanyimportantbranchoftheinlandcommerceofthecountry. Goodscar-\nried coastwise, indeed, require certificates or coast-cockets. If you except\ncoals, however, the rest are almost all duty-free. This freedom of interior\ncommerce, the effect of the uniformity of the system of taxation, is per-\nhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of Great Britain, every\ngreatcountrybeingnecessarilythebestandmostextensivemarketforthe\ngreater part of the productions of its own industry. If the same freedom,\nin consequence of the same uniformity, could be extended to Ireland and\ntheplantations,boththegrandeurofthestateandtheprosperityofevery\npartoftheempirewouldprobablybestillgreaterthanatpresent.\n1964 [70] In France, the different revenue laws which take place in the differ-\nentprovincesrequireamultitudeofrevenueofficerstosurroundnotonly\nthefrontiersofthekingdom,butthoseofalmosteachparticularprovince,\nin order either to prevent the importation of certain goods, or to subject\nit to the payment of certain duties, to the no small interruption of the\ninterior commerce of the country.

Thebestandmostfrugalwayof\nlevying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is necessary for\npaying the stipulated rent, the salaries of the officers, and the whole ex-\npense of administration, the farmer must always draw from the produce\nof the tax a certain profit proportioned at least to the advance which he\nmakes, to the risk which he runs, to the trouble which he is at, and to\ntheknowledgeandskillwhichitrequirestomanagesoverycomplicateda\nconcern.

In France, the duties\nupontobaccoandsaltareleviedinthismanner. Insuchcasesthefarmer,\ninstead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people; the profit of\nthe farmer, and the still more exorbitant one of the monopolist. Tobacco\nbeing a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he chooses.\nButsaltbeinganecessary,everymanisobligedtobuyofthefarmeracer-\ntain quantity of it; because, if he did not buy this quantity of the farmer,\nhe would, it is presumed, buy it of some smuggler.

The smuggling of salt and tobacco sends every\nyear several hundred people to the galleys, besides a very considerable\nnumber whom it sends to the gibbet. Those taxes levied in this manner\nyield a very considerable revenue to government.

Similar taxes and monopolies of salt and tobacco have been estab-\nlishedinmanyothercountries;particularlyintheAustrianandPrussian\ndominions,andinthegreaterpartofthestatesofItaly.\n1970 [76] InFrance,thegreaterpartoftheactualrevenueofthecrownisderived\nfromeightdifferentsources;thetaille,thecapitation,thetwovingtiemes,\nthe gabelles, the aides, the traites, the domaine, and the farm of tobacco.\nThe five last are, in the greater part of the provinces, under farm.

First, by abolishing the taille and the capita-\ntion, and by increasing the number of vingtiemes, so as to produce an ad-\nditional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes, the revenue of\nthecrownmightbepreserved;theexpenseofcollectionmightbemuchdi-\nminished;thevexationoftheinferiorranksofpeople,whichthetailleand\ncapitation occasion, might be entirely prevented; and the superior ranks\nmightnotbemoreburdenedthanthegreaterpartofthemareatpresent.\nThe vingtieme, I have already observed, is a tax very nearly of the same\nkindwithwhatiscalledtheland-taxofEngland. Theburdenofthetaille,\nit is acknowledged, falls finally upon the proprietors of land; and as the\ngreater part of the capitation is assessed upon those who are subject to\nthe taille at so much a pound of that other tax, the final payment of the\ngreaterpartofitmustlikewisefalluponthesameorderofpeople. Though\nthe number of the vingtiemes, therefore, was increased so as to produce\nan additional revenue equal to the amount of both those taxes, the super-\nior ranks of people might not be more burdened than they are at present.\nManyindividualsnodoubtwould,onaccountofthegreatinequalitieswith\nwhichthetailleiscommonlyassessedupontheestatesandtenantsofdif-\nferent individuals.

In Great Britain ten millions sterling are annually levied upon\nless than eight millions of people without its being possible to say that\nany particular order is oppressed. From the collections of the Abbe Ex-\npilly,andtheobservationsoftheauthoroftheEssayuponlegislationand\ncommerceofcorn,itappearsprobablethatFrance,includingtheprovinces\nof Lorraine and Bar, contains about twenty-three or twenty-four millions\nofpeoplethreetimesthenumberperhapscontainedinGreatBritain.

A part of their wool and raw hides they had\ngenerally an opportunity of selling for money. Some part of this money,\nperhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury\nwith which the circumstances of the times could furnish them; but some", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\npart of it they seem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well, in-\ndeed,doanythingelsebuthoardwhatevermoneytheysaved.

Among nations to whom commerce and manufac-\ntures are little known, the sovereign, it has already been observed in the\nfourth book, is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsi-\nmony requisite for accumulation. In that situation the expense even of a\nsovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy\nfineryofacourt.

Standing armies are not then necessary, so\nthattheexpenseevenofasovereign,likethatofanyothergreatlord,can\nbe employed in scarce anything but bounty to his tenants and hospitality\nto his retainers.

Thepresentandthe\nlate king of Prussia are the only great princes of Europe who, since the\ndeath of Henry IV of France in 1610, are supposed to have amassed any\nconsiderable treasure. The parsimony which leads to accumulation has\nbecome almost as rare in republican as in monarchical governments. The\nItalianrepublics,theUnitedProvincesoftheNetherlands,areallindebt.\nThe canton of Berne is the single republic in Europe which has amassed\nany considerable treasure.

When war comes, there is no money in the\ntreasurybutwhatisnecessaryforcarryingontheordinaryexpenseofthe\npeace establishment. In war an establishment of three of four times that\nexpense becomes necessary for the defence of the state, and consequently\na revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue. Supposing\nthat the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever has, the immediate\nmeans of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of\nhis expense, yet still the produce of the taxes, from which this increase\nof revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into the treasury till\nperhapstenortwelvemonthsaftertheyareimposed. Butthemomentin\nwhichwarbegins,orratherthemomentinwhichitappearslikelytobegin,\nthe army must be augmented, the fleet must be fitted out, the garrisoned\ntowns must be put into a posture of defence; that army, that fleet, those\ngarrisoned towns must be furnished with arms, ammunition, and provi-\nsions.

Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to\nlend.\n1981 [7] Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state\nwhich does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the\npeople do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property,\nin which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the\nauthorityofthestateisnotsupposedtoberegularlyemployedinenforcing\nthe payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and\nmanufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state in which there is\nnot a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government. The same\nconfidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers, upon or-\ndinary occasions, to trust their property to the protection of a particular\ngovernment, disposes them, upon extraordinary occasions, to trust that\ngovernment with the use of their property. By lending money to govern-\nment, they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry on\ntheir trade and manufactures. On the contrary, they commonly augment\nit. The necessities of the state render government upon most occasions\nwilling to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender.

Soon after the greater part of\nthe temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual, and\ndistributed into the Aggregate, South Sea, and General Funds, the cred-\nitors of the public, like those of private persons, were induced to accept of\nfive per cent for the interest of their money, which occasioned a saving of\none per cent upon the capital of the greater part of the debts which had\nbeen thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-sixth of the greater part of the\nannuities which were paid out of the three great funds above mentioned.\nThissavingleftaconsiderablesurplusintheproduceofthedifferenttaxes\nwhichhadbeenaccumulatedintothosefundsoverandabovewhatwasne-\ncessaryforpayingtheannuitieswhichwerenowchargeduponthem,and\nlaid the foundation of what has since been called the Sinking Fund. In\n1717, it amounted to 323,434l.7s.71d. In 1727, the interest of the greater\n2\npart of the public debts was still further reduced to four per cent; and in\n1753 and 1757, to three and a half and three per cent; which reductions\nstillfurtheraugmentedthesinkingfund.\n2002 [28] A sinking fund, though instituted for the payment of old, facilitates G.ed.p916\nvery much the contracting of new debts.

Whether the sinking\nfundofGreatBritainhasbeenmorefrequentlyappliedtotheoneortothe\notherofthosetwopurposeswillsufficientlyappearbyandby.\n2003 [29] Besides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by per-\npetual funding, there are two other methods which hold a sort of middle\n714", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nplacebetweenthem. Theseare,thatofborrowinguponannuitiesforterms\nofyears,andthatofborrowinguponannuitiesforlives.\n2004 [30] During the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, large sums were\nfrequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were some-\ntimes longer and sometimes shorter. In 1693, an act was passed for bor-\nrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent, or of 140,000l. a\nyearforsixteenyears. In1691, anactwaspassedforborrowingamillion\nuponannuitiesforlives,upontermswhichinthepresenttimeswouldap-\npearveryadvantageous. Butthesubscriptionwasnotfilledup. Inthefol-\nlowingyearthedeficiencywasmadegoodbyborrowinguponannuitiesfor\nlivesat fourteenper cent, or atlittle morethan sevenyears\u2019 purchase. In\n1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to ex-\nchangethemforothersofninety-sixyearsuponpayingintotheExchequer\nsixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the difference between four-\nteen per cent for life, and fourteen per cent for ninety-six years, was sold\nforsixty-threepounds,orforfourandahalfyears\u2019purchase. Suchwasthe\nsupposed instability of government that even these terms procured few\npurchasers. In the reign of Queen Anne money was upon different occa-\nsionsborrowedbothuponannuitiesforlives,anduponannuitiesforterms\nof thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety-eight, and of ninety-nine years. In\n1719,theproprietorsoftheannuitiesforthirty-twoyearswereinducedto G.ed.p917\naccept in lieu of them South Sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half\nyears\u2019 purchase of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of\nstock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them. In\n1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long\nandshortweresubscribedintothesamefund. Thelongannuitiesatthat\ntime amounted to 666,821l.8s.31d. a year. On the 5th of January 1775,\n2\ntheremainderofthem,orwhatwasnotsubscribedatthattime,amounted\nonlyto136,453l.12s.8d.\n2005 [31] During the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1755, little money\nwas borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for\nlives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth\nnearly as much money as a perpetuity, and should, therefore, one might\nthink, be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order\nto make family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into\nthe public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value\nwas continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable\nproportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity\nfor a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be very\nnearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the\nsame number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who mean\ngenerally to sell their subscriptions as soon as possible, prefer greatly a\nperpetual annuity redeemable by Parliament to an irredeemable annuity\nfor a long term of years of only equal amount. The value of the former\n715", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nmaybesupposedalwaysthesame,orverynearlythesame,anditmakes,\ntherefore,amoreconvenienttransferablestockthanthelatter.\n2006 [32] During the two last-mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of\nyearsorforlives,wereseldomgrantedbutaspremiumstothesubscribers\ntoanewloanoverandabovetheredeemableannuityorinterestuponthe\ncredit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted,\nnot as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed, but as an\nadditionalencouragementtothelender.\n2007 [33] Annuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different\nways; either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French\nare called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are\ngranted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant dis-\nburthensthepublicrevenuesofarasitwasaffectedbyhisannuity. When\nannuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public revenue\ndoes not commence till the death of all annuitants comprehended in one\nlot,whichmaysometimesconsistoftwentyorthirtypersons,ofwhomthe G.ed.p918\nsurvivors succeed to the annuities of all those who die before them, the\nlast survivor succeeding to the annuities of the whole lot. Upon the same\nrevenue more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities\nforseparatelives. Anannuity,witharightofsurvivorship,isreallyworth\nmore than an equal annuity for a separate life, and from the confidence\nwhicheverymannaturallyhasinhisowngoodfortune,theprincipleupon\nwhich is founded the success of all lotteries, such an annuity generally\nsellsforsomethingmorethanitisworth. Incountrieswhereitisusualfor\ngovernment to raise money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this\naccountgenerallypreferredtoannuitiesforseparatelives. Theexpedient\nwhich will raise most money is almost always preferred to that which is\nlikely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the public\nrevenue.\n2008 [34] In France a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in\nannuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by\nthe Parliament of Bordeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt of\nFrance is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres, of which\nthe capital for which annuities for lives had been granted is supposed to\namounttothreehundredmillions,theeighthpartofthewholepublicdebt.\nTheannuitiesthemselvesarecomputedtoamounttothirtymillionsayear,\nthefourthpartofonehundredandtwentymillions,thesupposedinterest\nofthatwholedebt. Theseestimations,Iknowverywell,arenotexact,but\nhaving been presented by so very respectable a body as approximations\nto the truth, they may, I apprehend, be considered as such. It is not the\ndifferentdegreesofanxietyinthetwogovernmentsofFranceandEngland\nfor the liberation of the public revenue which occasions this difference in\ntheirrespectivemodesofborrowing. Itarisesaltogetherfromthedifferent\nviewsandinterestsofthelenders.\n2009 [35] In England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile\n716", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\ncity in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance\nmoneytogovernment. Byadvancingittheydonotmeantodiminish,but,\non the contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals, and unless they ex-\npected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a new\nloan, they never would subscribe. But if by advancing their money they\nwere to purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only, G.ed.p919\nwhether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so\nlikelytosellthemwithaprofit. Annuitiesupontheirownlivestheywould\nalways sell with loss, because no man will give for an annuity upon the\nlifeofanother,whoseageandstateofhealtharenearlythesamewithhis\nown, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An an-\nnuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal value\nto the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish from the\nmoment it is granted, and continues to do so more and more as long as it\nsubsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferable stock\nas a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always\nthesame,orverynearlythesame.\n2010 [36] In France, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city,\nmerchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance\nmoney to government.

Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but of great\nwealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud to marry their\nequals, and women of quality disdain to marry them.

If they produce more, it is generally\nsomething which was neither intended nor expected, and is therefore sel-\ndom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen not so much\nfrom any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was neces-\nsary for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them, as\nfromasubsequentreductionofthatinterest. ThatofHollandin1655,and\nthat of the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed in this manner.\nHencetheusualinsufficiencyofsuchfunds.\n2014 [40] Duringthemostprofoundpeacevariouseventsoccurwhichrequirean\nextraordinary expense, and government finds it always more convenient\nto defray this expense by misapplying the sinking fund than by impos-\ning a new tax.

A momentary suspension of the payment\nof debt is not immediately felt by the people, and occasions neither mur-\nmur nor complaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious\nand easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty. The more the\n718", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\npublicdebtsmayhavebeenaccumulated,themorenecessaryitmayhave\nbecome to study to reduce them, the more dangerous, the more ruinous\nit may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund; the less likely is the\npublic debt to be reduced to any considerable degree, the more likely, the\nmore certainly is the sinking fund to be misapplied towards defraying all\ntheextraordinaryexpenseswhichoccurintimeofpeace.

The\nremainingdebt,therefore,amountedonlyto16,394,701l.1s.71d.\n4\n2017 [43] In the war which began in 1709., and which was concluded by the\nTreaty of Utrecht, the public debts were still more accumulated. On the\n31st of December 1714, they amounted to 53,681,076l.5s.6 1 d. The sub-\n12\nscriptionintotheSouthSeafundoftheshortandlongannuitiesincreased\nthe capital of the public debts, so that on the 31st of December, 1722 it G.ed.p922\namountedto55,282,978l.1s.35d.Thereductionofthedebtbeganin1723,\n6\nand went on so slowly that, on the 31st of December 1739, during seven-\nteen years of profound peace, the whole sum paid off was no more than\n8,328,354l.17s.11 1 d., the capital of the public debt at that time amount-\n12\ningto46,954,623l.3s.4 7 d.\n12\n2018 [44] The Spanish war, which began in 1739, and the French war which\nsoon followed it occasioned further increase of the debt, which, on the\n31st of December 1748, after the war had been concluded by the Treaty\nof Aix la Chapelle, amounted to 78,293,313l.1s.103d. The most pro-\n4\nfound peace of seventeen years continuance had taken no more than\n8,328,354l.17s.11 3 d. from it.

In 1755, before the breaking out of the\n719", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nlate war, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 72,289,673l. On\nthe 5th of January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt\namounted to 122,603,336l.8s.21d.

In 1764,\n44\ntherefore,thepublicdebtofGreatBritain,fundedandunfundedtogether,\namounted, according to this author, to 139,516,807l.2s.4d. The annuities\nfor lives, too, which had been granted as premiums to the subscribers to\nthenewloansin1757,estimatedatfourteenyears\u2019purchase,werevalued\nat 472,500l.; and the annuities for long terms of years, granted as premi- G.ed.p923\nums likewise in 1761 and 1762, estimated at 271 years purchase, were\n2\nvaluedat6,826,875l.Duringapeaceofaboutsevenyears\u2019continuance,the\nprudent and truly patriot administration of Mr. Pelham was not able to\npay off an old debt of six millions. During a war of nearly the same con-\ntinuance,anewdebtofmorethanseventy-fivemillionswascontracted.\n2020 [46] On the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amoun-\nted to 124,996,086l.1s.61d.

The sinking G.ed.p924\nfund has, no doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the\ndebt which has been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per\ncents to three per cents, and by the annuities for lives which have fallen\nin,and,ifpeaceweretocontinue,amillion,perhaps,mightnowbeannu-\nally spared out of it towards the discharge of the debt.

In return\nfor the capital which they advanced they obtained, indeed, an annuity in\nthe public funds in most cases of more than equal value. This annuity,\nno doubt, replaced to them their capital, and enabled them to carry on\ntheir trade and business to the same or perhaps to a greater extent than\nbefore; that is, they were enabled either to borrow of other people a new\ncapital upon the credit of this annuity, or by selling it to get from other\n2[Smith]Ithasprovedmoreexpensivethanallofourformerwars;andhasinvolvedus\ninanadditionaldebtofmorethanonehundredmillions.

The public\nexpense, however, when defrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders more\norlessthefurtheraccumulationofnewcapital;butitdoesnotnecessarily\noccasionthedestructionofanyactuallyexistingcapital.\n2023 [49] When the public expense is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the\nannualdestructionofsomecapitalwhichhadbeforeexistedinthecountry;\nbytheperversionofsomeportionoftheannualproducewhichhadbefore\nbeendestinedforthemaintenanceofproductivelabourtowardsthatofun-\nproductivelabour.

Were the expense of\nwar to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the taxes\nfrom which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer G.ed.p926\nthan the war.

The people feeling, during the continuance of\nthe war, the complete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it, and gov-\nernment, in order to humour them, would not be under the necessity of\ncarrying it on longer than it was necessary to do so.

IsitlikelythatinGreatBritainaloneapracticewhichhasbrought\neither weakness or desolation into every other country should prove alto-\ngetherinnocent?\n2032 [58] The system of taxation established in those different countries, it may\nbe said, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought\nto be remembered that, when the wisest government has exhausted all\nthe proper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have\nrecourse to improper ones. The wise republic of Holland has upon some G.ed.p929\noccasions been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the\ngreater part of those of Spain. Another war begun before any consider-\nableliberationofthepublicrevenuehadbeenbroughtabout,andgrowing\nin its progress as expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible neces-\nsity, render the British system of taxation as oppressive as that of Hol-\nland, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of\ntaxation,indeed,ithashithertogivensolittleembarrassmenttoindustry\nthat,duringthecourseevenofthemostexpensivewars,thefrugalityand\ngood conduct of individuals seem to have been able, by saving and accu-\nmulation, to repair all the breaches which the waste and extravagance of\ngovernment had made in the general capital of the society. At the conclu-\nsion of the late war, the most expensive that Great Britain ever waged,\nheragriculturewasasflourishing,hermanufacturersasnumerousandas\nfully employed, and her commerce as extensive as they had ever been be-\nfore. The capital, therefore, which supported all those different branches\nof industry must have been equal to what it had ever been before. Since\nthepeace,agriculturehasbeenstillfurtherimproved,therentsofhouses\nhaverisenineverytownandvillageofthecountry,aproofoftheincreas-\ningwealthandrevenueofthepeople; andtheannualamountthegreater\npart of the old taxes, of the principal branches of the excise and customs\ninparticular,hasbeencontinuallyincreasing,anequallyclearproofofan\nincreasingconsumption,andconsequentlyofanincreasingproducewhich\ncould alone support that consumption.

The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been\nbroughtaboutbybankruptcy;sometimesbyanavowedone,butalwaysby\narealone,thoughfrequentlybyapretendedpayment.\n2034 [60] The raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual\nexpedientbywhicharealpublicbankruptcyhasbeendisguisedunderthe\nappearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example, should\neitherbyActofParliamentorRoyalProclamationberaisedtothedenom-\ninationofashilling, andtwentysixpencestothatofapoundsterling; the\nperson who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty shillings, G.ed.p930\nor near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with twenty six-\npences, or with something less than two ounces. A national debt of about\nahundredandtwenty-eightmillions,nearlythecapitalofthefundedand\nunfunded debt of Great Britain, might in this manner be paid with about\nsixty-four millions of our present money. It would indeed be a pretended\npayment only, and the creditors of the public would really be defrauded\nof ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them. The calamity, too,\nwouldextendmuchfurtherthantothecreditorsofthepublic,andthoseof\nevery private person would suffer a proportionable loss; and this without\nanyadvantage,butinmostcaseswithagreatadditionalloss,tothecred-\nitors of the public. If the creditors of the public, indeed, were generally\nmuch in debt to other people, they might in some measure compensate\ntheir loss by paying their creditors in the same coin in which the public\nhad paid them. But in most countries the creditors of the public are, the\ngreater part of them, wealthy people, who stand more in the relation of\ncreditorsthaninthatofdebtorstowardstherestoftheirfellow-citizens. A\npretended payment of this kind, therefore, instead of alleviating, aggrav-\nates in most cases the loss of the creditors of the public, and without any\nadvantage to the public, extends the calamity to a great number of other\ninnocent people. It occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of\nthefortunesofprivatepeople,enrichinginmostcasestheidleandprofuse\ndebtorattheexpenseoftheindustriousandfrugalcreditor,andtransport-\ningagreatpartofthenationalcapitalfromthehandswhichwerelikelyto\nincrease and improve it to those which are likely to dissipate and destroy\nit. Whenitbecomesnecessaryforastatetodeclareitselfbankrupt,inthe\nsame manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a\nfair, open, and avowed bankruptcy is always the measure which is both\nleast dishonourable to the debtor and least hurtful to the creditor.

The republic was, in this\nmanner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted with the\nsixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and so great a bankruptcy,\nweshouldinthepresenttimesbeapttoimagine, musthaveoccasioneda\nvery violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have occasioned any. G.ed.p931\nThe law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating to the coin, in-\ntroducedandcarriedthroughtheassemblyofthepeoplebyatribune,and\nwas probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all the other ancient re-\npublics, the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and the great,\nwho in order to secure their votes at the annual elections, used to lend\nthemmoneyatexorbitantinterest,which,beingneverpaid,soonaccumu-\nlated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for anybody else\ntopayforhim. Thedebtor,forfearofaverysevereexecution,wasobliged,\nwithout any further gratuity, to vote for the candidate whom the creditor\nrecommended. Inspiteofallthelaws againstbriberyand corruption, the\nbountyofthecandidates,togetherwiththeoccasionaldistributionsofcorn\nwhich were ordered by the senate, were the principal funds from which,\nduring the latter times of the Roman republic, the poorer citizens derived\ntheirsubsistence. Todeliverthemselvesfromthissubjectiontotheircred-\nitors, the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for an entire\nabolition of debts, or for what they called New Tables; that is, for a law\nwhich should entitle them to a complete acquittance upon paying only a\ncertainproportionoftheiraccumulateddebts. Thelawwhichreducedthe\ncoin of all denominations to a sixth part of its former value, as it enabled\nthem to pay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed, was\nequivalent to the most advantageous New Tables. In order to satisfy the\npeople, the rich and the great were, upon several different occasions, ob-\nligedtoconsenttolawsbothforabolishingdebts,andforintroducingNew\nTables; and they probably were induced to consent to this law partly for\nthe same reason, and partly that, by liberating the public revenue, they\nmightrestorevigourtothatgovernmentofwhichtheythemselveshadthe\nprincipal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt\nof a hundred and twenty-eight millions to twenty-one millions three hun-\ndredandthirty-threethousandthreehundredandthirty-threepoundssix\nshillingsandeightpence. InthecourseofthesecondPunicwartheAswas\nstillfurtherreduced,first,fromtwoouncesofcoppertooneounce,andaf-\nterwardsfromoneouncetohalfanounce;thatis,tothetwenty-fourthpart\nof its original value. By combining the three Roman operations into one,\nadebtofahundredandtwenty-eightmillionsofourpresentmoneymight\nin this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of five millions three hun-\ndredandthirty-threethousandthreehundredandthirty-threepoundssix G.ed.p932\nshillingsandeightpence.

Fromthisrevenue,supposingthatthis\nsystem could produce it, must be deducted the revenue usually raised in\nIreland and the plantations for defraying the expense of their respective\ncivil governments. The expense of the civil and military establishment of\nIreland, together with the interest of the public debt, amounts, at a me-\ndium of the two years which ended March 1775, to something less than\nseven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year. By a very exact account\nof the revenue of the principal colonies of America and the West Indies,\nit amounted, before the commencement of the present disturbances, to a\nhundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds. In this account,\nhowever, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of all our late G.ed.p938\nacquisitions both upon the continent and in the islands is omitted, which\nmay perhaps make a difference of thirty or forty thousand pounds. For\nthe sake of even numbers, therefore, let us suppose that the revenue ne-\ncessaryforsupportingthecivilgovernmentofIrelandandtheplantations\nmay amount to a million. There would remain consequently a revenue of\nfifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds to be applied to-\nwards defraying the general expense of the empire, and towards paying\nthepublicdebt. ButiffromthepresentrevenueofGreatBritainamillion\ncould in peaceable times be spared towards the payment of that debt, six\nmillionstwohundredandfiftythousandpoundscouldverywellbespared\nfrom this improved revenue. This great sinking fund, too, might be aug-\nmented every year by the interest of the debt which had been discharged\nthe year before, and might in this manner increase so very rapidly as to\nbe sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt, and thus to re-\nstore completely the at present debilitated and languishing vigour of the\nempire. In the meantime the people might be relieved from some of the\nmostburdensometaxes;fromthosewhichareimposedeitheruponthene-\ncessariesoflife,oruponthematerialsofmanufacture.

In a poor country the\nconsumptionoftheprincipalcommoditiessubjecttothedutiesofcustoms\nand excise is very small, and in a thinly inhabited country the opportun-\nitiesofsmugglingareverygreat. Theconsumptionofmaltliquorsamong\ntheinferiorranksofpeopleinScotlandisverysmall, andtheexciseupon\nmalt, beer, and ale produces less there than in England in proportion to\nthe numbers of the people and the rate of the duties, which upon malt is\ndifferent on account of a supposed difference of quality. In these partic-\nular branches of the excise there is not, I apprehend, much more smug-\ngling in the one country than in the other. The duties upon the distillery,\nand the greater part of the duties of customs, in proportion to the num- G.ed.p939\nbers of people in the respective countries, produce less in Scotland than\nin England, not only on account of the smaller consumption of the taxed\ncommodities,butofthemuchgreaterfacilityofsmuggling. InIrelandthe\ninferior ranks of people are still poorer than in Scotland, and many parts\nof the country are almost as thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the\nconsumption of the taxed commodities might, in proportion to the num-\nber of the people, be still less thanScotland, and the facility ofsmuggling\nnearlythesame. InAmericaandtheWestIndiesthewhitepeopleevenof\nthe lowest rank are in much better circumstances than those of the same\nrank in England, and their consumption of all the luxuries in which they\nusually indulge themselves is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed,\nwhomakethegreaterpartoftheinhabitantsbothofthesoutherncolonies\nuponthecontinentandoftheWestIndiaislands,astheyareinastateof\nslavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people either\nin Scotland or Ireland. We must not, however, upon that account, ima-\ngine that they are worse fed, or that their consumption of articles which\nmight be subjected to moderate duties is less than that even of the lower\nranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is the\ninterestoftheirmasterthattheyshouldbefedwellandkeptingoodheart\nin the same manner as it is his interest that his working cattle should be\n733", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nso.

The opportunities of smuggling, indeed, would be much\ngreater; America, in proportion to the extent of the country, being much\nmore thinly inhabited than either Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue,\nhowever, which is at present raised by the different duties upon malt and\nmaltliquorsweretobeleviedbyasingledutyuponmalt,theopportunity\nof smuggling in the most important branch of the excise would be almost\nentirelytakenaway: andifthedutiesofcustoms,insteadofbeingimposed\nuponalmostallthedifferentarticlesofimportation,wereconfinedtoafew\nofthemostgeneraluseandconsumption,andifthelevyingofthoseduties\nweresubjectedtotheexciselaws,theopportunityofsmuggling,thoughnot\nso entirely taken away, would be very much diminished.

We already get all the gold and silver which they have. How is it\npossibletodrawfromthemwhattheyhavenot?\n2053 [79] The present scarcity of gold and silver money in America is not the\neffect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people there\nto purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of labour are so\nmuch higher, and the price of provisions so much lower than in England,\nthe greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase\nagreaterquantityifitwereeithernecessaryorconvenientforthemtodo\nso. Thescarcityofthosemetals,therefore,mustbetheeffectofchoice,and\nnotofnecessity.\n2054 [80] It is for transacting either domestic or foreign business that gold and\nsilvermoneyiseithernecessaryorconvenient.\n2055 [81] Thedomesticbusinessofeverycountry,ithasbeenshowninthesecond\nbook of this Inquiry, may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by\nmeansofapapercurrencywithnearlythesamedegreeofconveniencyas\nby gold and silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could\nalways employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater\nstock than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expense\nof so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver, and rather\n734", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nto employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary\nfor purchasing those metals in purchasing the instruments of trade, the\nmaterials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the iron-\nwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and planta-\ntions; in purchasing, not dead stock, but active and productive stock. The\ncolonygovernmentsfinditfortheirinteresttosupplythepeoplewithsuch\na quantity of papermoney as is fully sufficient and generally more than\nsufficient for transacting their domestic business. Some of those govern-\nments, that of Pennsylvania particularly, derive a revenue from lending\nthispaper-moneytotheirsubjectsataninterestofsomuchpercent. Oth-\ners, like that of Massachusetts Bay, advance upon extraordinary emer-\ngencies a paper-money of this kind for defraying the public expense, and G.ed.p941\nafterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the colony, redeem it at the\ndepreciatedvaluetowhichitgraduallyfalls.

The\nredundancy of paper-money necessarily banishes gold and silver from the\ndomestictransactionsofthecolonies,forthesamereasonthatithasban-\nished those metals from the greater part of the domestic transactions in\nScotland; and in both countries it is not the poverty, but the enterprising\nand projecting spirit of the people, their desire of employing all the stock\nwhich they can get as active and productive stock, which has occasioned\nthisredundancyofpaper-money.\n2056 [82] In the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with\nGreat Britain, gold and silver are more or less employed exactly in pro-\nportion as they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are not\nnecessary they seldom appear. Where they are necessary they are gener-\nallyfound.\n2057 [83] In the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies the\nBritish goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long\ncredit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price.\nIt is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and\nsilver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods\nwhichhiscorrespondentshadsoldtohiminsomeothersortofgoodswhich\nhe might happen to deal in than in money.

TheBritish G.ed.p942\nmerchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular\nset of correspondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive payment\nfor the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco than in gold and\nsilver. They expect to make a profit by the sale of the tobacco. They could\nmake none by that of the gold and silver. Gold and silver, therefore, very\nseldom appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco\ncolonies.

The sugar and rum which\nthe West India merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own ac-\ncount are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell there.\nA balance, therefore, must necessarily be paid to them in gold and silver,\nandthisbalance,too,isgenerallyfound.\n2060 [86] Thedifficultyandirregularityofpaymentfromthedifferentcoloniesto\nGreatBritainhavenotbeenatallinproportiontothegreatnessorsmall-\nness of the balances which were respectively due from them. Payments\nhaveingeneralbeenmoreregularfromthenorthernthanfromthetobacco\ncolonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large balance in\nmoney, while the latter have either paid no balance, or a much smaller\none. The difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar colonies\nhas been greater or less in proportion, not so much to the extent of the G.ed.p943\nbalances respectively due from them, as to the quantity of uncultivated\nland which they contained; that is, to the greater or smaller temptation\nwhich the planters have been under of overtrading, or of undertaking the\nsettlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste land than suited\ntheextentoftheircapitals. ThereturnsfromthegreatislandofJamaica,\n736", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nwherethereisstillmuchuncultivatedland,have,uponthisaccount,been\nin general more irregular and uncertain than those from the smaller is-\nlands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christophers, which have for these\nmany years been completely cultivated, and have, upon that account, af-\nfordedlessfieldforthespeculationsoftheplanter.

Their\ngreatdemandforactiveandproductivestockmakesitconvenientforthem\nto have as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them upon that ac-\ncount to content themselves with a cheaper though less commodious in-\nstrument of commerce than gold and silver. They are thereby enabled to\nconvertthevalueofthatgoldandsilverintotheinstrumentsoftrade,into\nthe materials of clothing, into household furniture, and into the ironwork\nnecessaryforbuildingandextendingtheirsettlementsandplantations. In\nthose branches of business which cannot be transacted without gold and\nsilver money, it appears that they can always find the necessary quant-\nity of those metals; and if they frequently do not find it, their failure is\ngenerally the effect, not of their necessary poverty, but of their unneces-\nsary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are poor that their\npayments are irregular and uncertain, but because they are too eager to\nbecomeexcessivelyrich. Thoughallthatpartoftheproduceofthecolony\ntaxes whichwas over andabove what was necessary for defrayingthe ex-\npense of their own civil and military establishments were to be remitted\nto Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have abundantly where-\nwithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals. They would in\nthis case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their surplus produce,\nwithwhichtheynowpurchaseactiveandproductivestock,fordeadstock.\nIn transacting their domestic business they would be obliged to employ\na costly instead of a cheap instrument of commerce, and the expense of\npurchasingthiscostlyinstrumentmightdampsomewhatthevivacityand\nardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of land. It might\nnot, however, be necessary to remit any part of the American revenue in\ngold and silver. It might be remitted in bills drawn upon and accepted\nby particular merchants or companies in Great Britain to whom a part of G.ed.p944\nthe surplus produce of America had been consigned, who would pay into\nthe treasury the American revenue in money, after having themselves re-\nceivedthevalueofitingoods;andthewholebusinessmightfrequentlybe\ntransactedwithoutexportingasingleounceofgoldorsilverfromAmerica.\n2062 [88] It is not contrary to justice that both Ireland and America should con-\ntribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain.

In the case of a total separation from Great Britain, which,\nunless prevented by a union of this kind, seems very likely to take place,\nthosefactionswouldbetentimesmorevirulentthanever.

Inallgreatcountrieswhichareunitedunderone\nuniform government, the spirit of party commonly prevails less in the re-\nmote provinces than in the centre of the empire. The distance of those\nprovinces from the capital, from the principal seat of the great scramble\nof faction and ambition, makes them enter less into the views of any of\n738", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nthe contending parties, and renders them more indifferent and impartial\nspectators of the conduct of all. The spirit of party prevails less in Scot-\nlandthaninEngland. Inthecaseofaunionitwouldprobablyprevailless\nin Ireland than in Scotland, and the colonies would probably soon enjoy a\ndegree of concord and unanimity at present unknown in any part of the\nBritishempire. BothIrelandandthecolonies, indeed, wouldbesubjected\ntoheaviertaxesthananywhichtheyatpresentpay. Inconsequence,how-\never, of a diligent and faithful application of the public revenue towards\nthe discharge of the national debt, the greater part of those taxes might\nnotbeoflongcontinuance, andthepublicrevenueofGreatBritainmight\nsoon be reduced to what was necessary for maintaining a moderate peace\nestablishment.\n2065 [91] The territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, the undoubted\nright of the crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain, might\nbe rendered another source of revenue more abundant, perhaps, than all\nthose already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more fer-\ntile, more extensive, and, in proportion to their extent, much richer and\nmorepopulousthanGreatBritain. Inordertodrawagreatrevenuefrom\nthem, it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system of\ntaxationintocountrieswhicharealreadysufficientlyandmorethansuffi-\ncientlytaxed. Itmight,perhaps,bemorepropertolightenthantoaggrav-\nate the burden of those unfortunate countries, and to endeavour to draw\na revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes, but by preventing the G.ed.p946\nembezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they\nalreadypay.\n2066 [92] If it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any con-\nsiderable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources above men-\ntioned, the only resource which can remain to her is a diminution of her\nexpense. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public\nrevenue, though in both there may be still room for improvement, Great\nBritain seems to be at least as economical as any of her neighbours. The\nmilitaryestablishmentwhichshemaintainsforherowndefenceintimeof\npeaceismoremoderatethanthatofanyEuropeanstatewhichcanpretend\ntorivalhereitherinwealthorinpower.

The expense of\nthe peace establishment of the colonies was, before the commencement of\nthepresentdisturbances,veryconsiderable,andisanexpensewhichmay,\nand if no revenue can be drawn from them ought certainly to be saved al-\ntogether. Thisconstantexpenseintimeofpeace, thoughverygreat, isin-\nsignificantincomparisonwithwhatthedefenceofthecolonieshascostus\nintimeofwar. Thelastwar,whichwasundertakenaltogetheronaccount\nof the colonies, cost Great Britain, it has already been observed, upwards\nofninetymillions. TheSpanishwarof1739wasprincipallyundertakenon\ntheir account, in which, and in the French war that was the consequence\nof it, Great Britain spent upwards of forty millions, a great part of which\n739", "TheWealthofNations AdamSmith\nought justly to be charged to the colonies. In those two wars the colon-\niescostGreatBritainmuchmorethandoublethesumwhichthenational\ndebt amounted to before the commencement of the first of them. Had it\nnotbeenforthosewarsthatdebtmight,andprobablywouldbythistime,\nhavebeencompletelypaid;andhaditnotbeenforthecolonies,theformer\nof those wars might not, and the latter certainly would not have been un-\ndertaken. Itwasbecausethecoloniesweresupposedtobeprovincesofthe\nBritish empire that this expense was laid out upon them. But countries\nwhich contribute neither revenue nor military force towards the support\nof the empire cannot be considered as provinces.

If the colonies, notwithstanding their refusal\nto submit to British taxes, are still to be considered as provinces of the\nBritish empire, their defence in some future war may cost Great Britain\nas great an expense as it ever has done in any former war.
