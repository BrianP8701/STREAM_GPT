Here's a story for you:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a pirate named Captain Jack Sparrow who sailed the seas in search of his next adventure. He was a notorious rogue with a reputation for being unpredictable and a bit of a scallywag.\n\nOne day, Captain Jack encountered a group of treasure-hunting rivals who were also after the same treasure. The rivals tried to steal the treasure from Captain Jack, but he outsmarted them and managed to keep the treasure for himself.\n\nHowever, Captain Jack soon discovered that the treasure he had stolen was cursed. Every time he tried to use it, it would cause him some sort of trouble or inconvenience. For example, whenever he tried to spend it, it would turn into a pile of sand or a bunch of sea turtles.\n\nDespite the curse, Captain Jack was determined to find a way to break it. He set out on a journey to find a wise old seer who could help him lift the curse. Along the way, he encountered all sorts of strange and magical creatures, including a talking parrot and a sea witch.\n\nFinally, Captain Jack found the seer and explained his predicament. The seer told him that the only way to break the curse was to return the treasure to its rightful owner.\n\nCaptain Jack was hesitant at first, but he knew that it was the right thing to do. He set out on a new adventure to find the rightful owner of the treasure, and along the way, he discovered that sometimes the greatest treasures are not the ones that can be measured in gold or silver, but the ones that come with a sense of purpose and meaning.\n\nAnd so, Captain Jack returned the treasure to its rightful owner, and the curse was lifted. He sailed off into the sunset, a hero who had learned that the true treasure of life is not found in material possessions, but in the experiences and connections we make with others.\n\nYarr! Hope you enjoyed that tale, matey!\n\n## Streaming[\uf0c1](#streaming \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nUsing `stream_complete` endpoint\n\nfrom llama\\_index.llms import Bedrock\n\nllm \\= Bedrock(model\\=\"amazon.titan-text-express-v1\", profile\\_name\\=profile\\_name)\nresp \\= llm.stream\\_complete(\"Paul Graham is \")\n\nfor r in resp:\n    print(r.delta, end\\=\"\")\n\nPaul Graham is a computer programmer, entrepreneur, investor, and writer, best known for co-founding the internet firm Y Combinator.

She was known for her boldness, her wit, and her love of all things flashy and fancy. But beneath her swashbuckling exterior, there was a heart full of gold, and a desire to do good in the world.\n\nOne day, while on her usual voyages, the pirate came across a small island in distress. The villagers were suffering from a terrible drought, and their crops were failing. The pirate knew that she had to help them, and so she set out to find a way to bring water to the island.\n\nAfter much searching, the pirate discovered a hidden spring deep in the heart of the island. She worked tirelessly to build a system of pipes and aqueducts that would carry the spring water to the villages, and finally, after many long months of hard work, the drought was over, and the people were saved.\n\nThe pirate was hailed as a hero, and the villagers threw a grand celebration in her honor. But she knew that her work was not yet done. She continued to sail the seas, seeking out other ways to help those in need, and to spread joy and happiness wherever she went.\n\nAnd so, the pirate with the colorful personality lived out her days in a blaze of glory, inspiring others with her courage, her kindness, and her unquenchable sense of adventure.\n\n## Configure Model[\uf0c1](#configure-model \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nfrom llama\\_index.llms import Bedrock\n\nllm \\= Bedrock(model\\=\"amazon.titan-text-express-v1\", profile\\_name\\=profile\\_name)\n\nresp \\= llm.complete(\"Paul Graham is \")\n\nPaul Graham is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, investor, and writer.
