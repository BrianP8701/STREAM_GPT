    "text": "Uber and Lyft both experienced the fastest growth in their respective customer segments and geographies in 2021. \n\nFor Uber, the fastest growing customer segments were Riders and Eaters, who use the platform for ridesharing services and meal preparation, grocery, and other delivery services, respectively. Additionally, Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass membership programs grew significantly in 2021, with over 6 million members. Uber experienced the fastest growth in five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. Additionally, Uber experienced growth in suburban and rural areas, though the network is smaller and less liquid in these areas.\n\nFor Lyft, the fastest growing customer segments were ridesharing, Express Drive, Lyft Rentals, Light Vehicles, Public Transit, and Lyft Autonomous. Lyft has grown rapidly in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. The ridesharing market grew rapidly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow after the pandemic. The market for Lyft's other offerings, such as its network of Light Vehicles, is also new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow.\n\nOverall, Uber and Lyft experienced the fastest growth in different customer segments and geographies. Uber experienced the fastest growth in Riders and Eaters, as well as in five metropolitan areas, while Lyft experienced the fastest growth in ridesharing, Express Drive, Lyft Rentals, Light Vehicles, Public Transit, and Lyft Autonomous, as well as in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada."
