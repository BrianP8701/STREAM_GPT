Developers can thus identify content that our usage policies prohibits and take action, for instance by filtering it.\n\nThe models classifies the following categories:\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `hate` | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harrassment. |\n| `hate/threatening` | Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. |\n| `harassment` | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target. |\n| `harassment/threatening` | Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target. |\n| `self-harm` | Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\n| `self-harm/intent` | Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\n| `self-harm/instructions` | Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts. |\n| `sexual` | Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness). |\n| `sexual/minors` | Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old. |\n| `violence` | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. |\n| `violence/graphic` | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury in graphic detail. |\n\nThe moderation endpoint is free to use when monitoring the inputs and outputs of OpenAI APIs. We currently disallow other use cases. Accuracy may be lower on longer pieces of text. For higher accuracy, try splitting long pieces of text into smaller chunks each less than 2,000 characters.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve the accuracy of our classifier. Our support for non-English languages is currently limited.\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/quickstart)\n\n## [Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/quickstart)\n\nTo obtain a classification for a piece of text, make a request to the [moderation endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations) as demonstrated in the following code snippets:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/moderations \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\"input\": \"Sample text goes here\"}'\n```\n\nBelow is an example output of the endpoint. It returns the following fields:\n\n*   `flagged`: Set to `true` if the model classifies the content as violating OpenAI's usage policies, `false` otherwise.\n*   `categories`: Contains a dictionary of per-category binary usage policies violation flags. For each category, the value is `true` if the model flags the corresponding category as violated, `false` otherwise.\n*   `category_scores`: Contains a dictionary of per-category raw scores output by the model, denoting the model's confidence that the input violates the OpenAI's policy for the category. The value is between 0 and 1, where higher values denote higher confidence. The scores should not be interpreted as probabilities.\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n{\n  \"id\": \"modr-XXXXX\",\n  \"model\": \"text-moderation-005\",\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"flagged\": true,\n      \"categories\": {\n        \"sexual\": false,\n        \"hate\": false,\n        \"harassment\": false,\n        \"self-harm\": false,\n        \"sexual/minors\": false,\n        \"hate/threatening\": false,\n        \"violence/graphic\": false,\n        \"self-harm/intent\": false,\n        \"self-harm/instructions\": false,\n        \"harassment/threatening\": true,\n        \"violence\": true,\n      },\n      \"category_scores\": {\n        \"sexual\": 1.2282071e-06,\n        \"hate\": 0.010696256,\n        \"harassment\": 0.29842457,\n        \"self-harm\": 1.5236925e-08,\n        \"sexual/minors\": 5.7246268e-08,\n        \"hate/threatening\": 0.0060676364,\n        \"violence/graphic\": 4.435014e-06,\n        \"self-harm/intent\": 8.098441e-10,\n        \"self-harm/instructions\": 2.8498655e-11,\n        \"harassment/threatening\": 0.63055265,\n        \"violence\": 0.99011886,\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOpenAI will continuously upgrade the moderation endpoint's underlying model. Therefore, custom policies that rely on `category_scores` may need recalibration over time."
