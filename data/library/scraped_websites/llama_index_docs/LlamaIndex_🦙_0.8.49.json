Widely available models come pre-trained on huge amounts of publicly available data, from Wikipedia and mailing lists to textbooks and source code.\n\nApplications built on top of LLMs often require augmenting these models with private or domain-specific data. Unfortunately, that data can be distributed across siloed applications and data stores. It\u2019s behind APIs, in SQL databases, or trapped in PDFs and slide decks.\n\nThat\u2019s where **LlamaIndex** comes in.\n\n## \ud83e\udd99 How can LlamaIndex help?[\uf0c1](#how-can-llamaindex-help \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nLlamaIndex provides the following tools:\n\n*   **Data connectors** ingest your existing data from their native source and format. These could be APIs, PDFs, SQL, and (much) more.\n    \n*   **Data indexes** structure your data in intermediate representations that are easy and performant for LLMs to consume.\n    \n*   **Engines** provide natural language access to your data. For example:\n    \n    *   Query engines are powerful retrieval interfaces for knowledge-augmented output.\n        \n    *   Chat engines are conversational interfaces for multi-message, \u201cback and forth\u201d interactions with your data.\n        \n*   **Data agents** are LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, from simple helper functions to API integrations and more.\n    \n*   **Application integrations** tie LlamaIndex back into the rest of your ecosystem. This could be LangChain, Flask, Docker, ChatGPT, or\u2026 anything else!\n    \n\n## \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 Who is LlamaIndex for?[\uf0c1](#who-is-llamaindex-for \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nLlamaIndex provides tools for beginners, advanced users, and everyone in between.\n\nOur high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code.\n\nFor more complex applications, our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module\u2014data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, reranking modules\u2014to fit their needs.\n\n## \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Ecosystem[\uf0c1](#ecosystem \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nTo download or contribute, find LlamaIndex on:\n\n*   Github: [https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama\\_index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)\n    \n*   PyPi:\n    \n    *   LlamaIndex: [https://pypi.org/project/llama-index/](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index/).\n        \n    *   GPT Index (duplicate): [https://pypi.org/project/gpt-index/](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-index/).\n        \n*   NPM (Typescript/Javascript):\n    \n    *   Github: [https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS)\n        \n    *   Docs: [https://ts.llamaindex.ai/](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/)\n        \n    *   LlamaIndex.TS: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/llamaindex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/llamaindex)\n        \n    \n\n### Associated projects[\uf0c1](#associated-projects \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\n*   \ud83c\udfe1 LlamaHub: [https://llamahub.ai](https://llamahub.ai/) | A large (and growing!) collection of custom data connectors\n    \n*   \ud83e\uddea LlamaLab: [https://github.com/run-llama/llama-lab](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-lab) | Ambitious projects built on top of LlamaIndex"
