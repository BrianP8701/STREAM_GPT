This user-agent will only be used to take direct actions on behalf of ChatGPT users and is _not_ used for crawling the web in any automatic fashion.\n\n*   User agent token: `ChatGPT-User`\n*   Full user-agent string: `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; ChatGPT-User/1.0; +https://openai.com/bot`\n\nTo allow plugins to access your site you can explicitly add the `ChatGPT-User` to your site\u2019s robots.txt:\n\n```\nUser-agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow:\n```\n\nTo allow plugins to access your only parts of your site you can add the `ChatGPT-User` to your site\u2019s robots.txt like this:\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\nUser-agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow:\nAllow: /directory-1/\nAllow: /directory-2/\n```\n\nTo disallow plugins to access your site you can add the `ChatGPT-User` to your site\u2019s robots.txt:\n\n```\nUser-agent: ChatGPT-User\nDisallow: /\n```\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/ip-egress-ranges)\n\n### [IP egress ranges](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/ip-egress-ranges)\n\nFor OpenAI's web browsing plugin, calls to websites will be made from the `23.98.142.176/28` IP address block.\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/usage)\n\n## [Usage](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/usage)\n\nWeb pages crawled with the ChatGPT-User/1.0 user agent is primarily used to answer a live query from a user that submits a question or prompt to ChatGPT through its browsing feature. When content is retrieved from web pages by our user agent, it is used by our models to provide an answer to the user, our models will include a link to the websource. ChatGPTis trained to not repeat information verbatim from the data (although this is not perfect), but it will paraphrase, translate, summarize, and abstract information as requested by the user.\n\nRetrieved content is only used in the training process to teach our models how to respond to a user request given this content (i.e., to make our models better at browsing), not to make our models better at creating responses. The content may be seen by OpenAI employees and trainers who are improving our models. Retrieved content is not used to train our models to be able to reproduce the content verbatim or to build a search engine.\n\nWe fetch the data on nearly every user request, using caching to reduce load, striving to show the freshest content to users. The data is stored for training purposes as described above and so users can access the conversation history in their accounts.\n\n[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/chatgpt-user-and-gptbot)\n\n### [ChatGPT-User and GPTBot](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/bot/chatgpt-user-and-gptbot)\n\nOpenAI has two separate user agents for web crawling and user browsing, so you know which use-case a given request is for. Our opt-out system currently treats both user agents the same, so any robots.txt disallow for one agent will cover both. [Read more about GPTBot here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot)."
