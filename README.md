# STREAM_GPT

this repo is dead. I realized a lot of the stuff i was doing here was pointless cuz i was redoing a lot of what other big packages like llama-index was doing.

Now instead:
- interact with all my ais (RAG, agents) at: https://github.com/BrianP8701/onno
- and agent swarm experiments at: https://github.com/BrianP8701/Agent_Swarm_Experiments
