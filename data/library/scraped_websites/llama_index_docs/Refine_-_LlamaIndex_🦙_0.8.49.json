At one point, he received advice from a friend that urged him not to let Y Combinator be his final noteworthy achievement. This advice prompted him to reflect on his future with Y Combinator and ultimately led him to pass on the responsibility to others. He approached Jessica and Sam Altman to assume leadership positions in Y Combinator, aiming to secure its continued success."
