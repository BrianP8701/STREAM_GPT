She had always loved the ocean, and today was no different. The water was a deep blue, almost purple, and the waves were gentle and soothing. Lily closed her eyes and let the sound of the waves wash over her, feeling the stress of her daily life melt away.\nSuddenly, a seagull landed nearby, chirping and flapping its wings. Lily opened her eyes and saw the bird was holding something in its beak. Curious, she leaned forward and saw that the bird was carrying a small, shimmering shell. The bird dropped the shell at Lily's feet, and she picked it up, feeling its smooth surface and admiring its beauty.\nAs she held the shell, Lily felt a strange sensation wash over her. She felt connected to the ocean and the bird, and she knew that this moment was special. She looked out at the water and saw a school of fish swimming in the distance, their scales shimmering in the sun\n\n## Call `complete` with Prompt[\uf0c1](#call-complete-with-prompt \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nresp \\= llm.complete(\"Tell me a joke\")\nprint(resp)\n\n Sure, here's a classic one:\n\nWhy don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!\n\nI hope that brought a smile to your face!\n\nresp \\= llm.stream\\_complete(\"Tell me a story in 250 words\")\nfor r in resp:\n    print(r.delta, end\\=\"\")\n\n Sure, here is a story in 250 words:\n\nAs the sun set over the horizon, a young girl named Maria sat on the beach, watching the waves roll in.
