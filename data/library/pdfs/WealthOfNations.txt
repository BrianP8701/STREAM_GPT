G.ed.p10
3 [1] THE annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies
it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually con-
sumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that
labour,orinwhatispurchasedwiththatproducefromothernations.
[2] Accordingtherefore,asthisproduce,orwhatispurchasedwithit,bears

agreaterorsmallerproportiontothenumberofthosewhoaretoconsume
it,thenationwillbebetterorworsesuppliedwithallthenecessariesand
conveniencesforwhichithasoccasion.
5 [3] Butthisproportionmustineverynationberegulatedbytwodifferent
circumstances; first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its
labour is generally applied; and, secondly, by the proportion between the
numberofthosewhoareemployedinusefullabour,andthatofthosewho
are not so employed. Whatever be the soil, climate, or extent of territory
ofanyparticularnation,theabundanceorscantinessofitsannualsupply
must,inthatparticularsituation,dependuponthosetwocircumstances.
6 [4] Theabundanceorscantinessofthissupply,too,seemstodependmore
upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among
the savage nations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to
work,ismoreorlessemployedinusefullabour,andendeavourstoprovide,
as well as he can, the necessaries and conveniences of life, for himself,
or such of his family or tribe as are either too old, or too young, or too
infirmtogoahuntingandfishing. Suchnations,however,aresomiserably
poorthat,frommerewant,theyarefrequentlyreduced,or,atleast,think
themselvesreduced,tothenecessitysometimesofdirectlydestroying,and
sometimesofabandoningtheirinfants,theiroldpeople,andthoseafflicted
with lingering diseases, to perish with hunger, or to be devoured by wild
beasts. Among civilised and thriving nations, on the contrary, though a
great number of people do not labour at all, many of whom consume the
produce of ten times, frequently of a hundred times more labour than the
greaterpartofthosewhowork;yettheproduceofthewholelabourofthe

even of the lowest and poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious, may
enjoyagreatershareofthenecessariesandconveniencesoflifethanitis
possibleforanysavagetoacquire.
7 [5] Thecausesofthisimprovement,intheproductivepowersoflabour,and G.ed.p11
the order, according to which its produce is naturally distributed among
the different ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject
oftheFirstBookofthisInquiry. TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
8 [6] Whateverbetheactualstateoftheskill,dexterity,andjudgmentwith
which labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its
annual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon
the proportion between the number of those who are annually employed
in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed. The number
ofusefulandproductivelabourers,itwillhereafterappear,iseverywhere
inproportiontothequantityofcapitalstockwhichisemployedinsetting
them to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. The
SecondBook,therefore,treatsofthenatureofcapitalstock,ofthemanner
in which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities of
labourwhichitputsintomotion, accordingtothedifferentwaysinwhich
itisemployed.
9 [7] Nations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment,
inthe applicationoflabour, havefollowedvery differentplansin thegen-
eral conduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been equally
favourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some nations has
givenextraordinaryencouragementtotheindustryofthecountry;thatof
others to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has dealt equally and
impartially with every sort of industry. Since the downfall of the Roman
empire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufac-
tures, and commerce, the industry of towns; than to agriculture, the in-
dustry of the country. The circumstances which seem to have introduced
andestablishedthispolicyareexplainedintheThirdBook.
10 [8] Though those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the
private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any
regard to, or foresight of, their consequences upon the general welfare
of the society; yet they have given occasion to very different theories of
politicalœconomy;ofwhichsomemagnifytheimportanceofthatindustry
whichiscarriedonintowns,othersofthatwhichiscarriedoninthecoun-
try. Those theories have had a considerable influence, not only upon the
opinionsofmenoflearning,butuponthepublicconductofprincesandsov-
ereignstates. Ihaveendeavoured,intheFourthBook,toexplain,asfully
and distinctly as I can, those different theories, and the principal effects
whichtheyhaveproducedindifferentagesandnations.

which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution
of the whole society; and which of them by that of some particular part
only, or of some particular members of it; secondly, what are the different

Of The Causes of Improvement in the
Productive Powers of Labour, and of
the Order According to which Its
Produce Is Naturally Distributed Among
the Different Ranks of the People CHAPTER I
OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR
[1] THE greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the
12
greaterpartoftheskill,dexterity,andjudgmentwithwhichitisanywhere
directed,orapplied,seemtohavebeentheeffectsofthedivisionoflabour.
13 [2] The effects of the division of labour, in the general business of soci- G.ed.p14
ety, will be more easily understood, by considering in what manner it op-
erates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be
carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is
carried further in them than in others of more importance: but in those
triflingmanufactureswhicharedestinedtosupplythesmallwantsofbut
asmallnumberofpeople,thewholenumberofworkmenmustnecessarily
be small; and those employed in every different branch of the work can
often be collected into the same workhouse, and placed at once under the
viewofthespectator. Inthosegreatmanufactures,onthecontrary,which
are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people,
everydifferentbranchoftheworkemployssogreatanumberofworkmen
that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse. We can
seldom see more, at one time, than those employed in one single branch.
Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided
intoamuchgreaternumberofpartsthaninthoseofamoretriflingnature,
thedivisionisnotnearsoobvious,andhasaccordinglybeenmuchlessob-
served.
[3] To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture; but
14
oneinwhichthedivisionoflabourhasbeenveryoftentakennoticeof,the
trade of the pin-maker; a workman not educated to this business (which
the division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with
the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the
same division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, per-
haps,withhisutmostindustry,makeonepininaday,andcertainlycould
notmaketwenty. Butinthewayinwhichthisbusinessisnowcarriedon,
not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a num-
ber of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. G.ed.p15
Onemandrawsoutthewire,anotherstraightsit,athirdcutsit,afourth
points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving, the head; to make the
head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put
themintothepaper;andtheimportantbusinessofmakingapinis,inthis
manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some
manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the
same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a
small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and
where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct oper-
ations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently
accommodatedwiththenecessarymachinery,theycould,whentheyexer-
ted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day.
There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size.
Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-
eightthousandpinsinaday. Eachperson,therefore,makingatenthpart
offorty-eightthousandpins,mightbeconsideredasmakingfourthousand
eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and
independently, and without any of them having been educated to this pe-
culiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,
perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and
fortieth,perhapsnotthefourthousandeighthundredthpartofwhatthey
are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division
andcombinationoftheirdifferentoperations.
15 [4] Ineveryotherartandmanufacture,theeffectsofthedivisionoflabour
are similar to what they are in this very trifling one; though, in many of
them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so
greatasimplicityofoperation. Thedivisionoflabour,however,sofarasit
canbeintroduced,occasions,ineveryart,aproportionableincreaseofthe
productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and em-
ploymentsfromoneanother,seemstohavetakenplace,inconsequenceof
this advantage. This separation too is generally carried furthest in those
countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement;
what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally
thatofseveralinanimprovedone. Ineveryimprovedsociety,thefarmeris G.ed.p16
generallynothingbutafarmer;themanufacturer,nothingbutamanufac-
turer. Thelabourtoowhichisnecessarytoproduceanyonecompleteman-
ufacture, is almost always divided among a great number of hands. How
many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and wool-
lenmanufactures,fromthegrowersoftheflaxandthewool,tothebleach-
ers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth!
Thenatureofagriculture,indeed, doesnotadmitofsomanysubdivisions
of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business from another,
as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely, the business of
the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the carpenter is
commonlyseparatedfromthatofthesmith. Thespinnerisalmostalways
a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the
sower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The
9 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
occasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different
seasonsoftheyear,itisimpossiblethatonemanshouldbeconstantlyem-
ployed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and
entire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in ag-
riculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive
powersoflabourinthisart,doesnotalwayskeeppacewiththeirimprove-
ment in manufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel
all their neighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they
arecommonlymoredistinguishedbytheirsuperiorityinthelatterthanin
the former. Their lands are in general better cultivated, and having more
labour and expense bestowed upon them, produce more, in proportion to
the extent and natural fertility of the ground. But this superiority of pro-
duce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labour
and expense. In agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always
muchmoreproductivethanthatofthepoor;or,atleast,itisneversomuch
more productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich
country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come
cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same
degreeofgoodness,isascheapasthatofFrance,notwithstandingthesu- G.ed.p17
perioropulenceandimprovementofthelattercountry. ThecornofFrance
is,inthecornprovinces,fullyasgood,andinmostyearsnearlyaboutthe
same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and improve-
ment, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,
however, are better cultivatedthanthose ofFrance, and thecorn-landsof
France are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But

corn,itcanpretendtonosuchcompetitioninitsmanufactures;atleastif

ThesilksofFrancearebetterandcheaperthanthoseofEngland,because
thesilkmanufacture, atleastunderthepresenthighdutiesupontheim-
portation of raw silk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that

ond all comparison superior to those of France, and much cheaper too in
the same degree of goodness. In Poland there are said to be scarce any

16 [5] Thisgreatincreaseofthequantityofwork,which,inconsequenceofthe
division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,
isowingtothreedifferentcircumstances;first,totheincreaseofdexterity
in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is
commonlylostinpassingfromonespeciesofworktoanother;andlastly,to
the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge
labour,andenableonemantodotheworkofmany.
17 [6] First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily
10 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
increases the quantity of the work he can perform, and the division of G.ed.p18
labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation,
and by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessar-
ily increased very much the dexterity of the workman. A common smith,
who, though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to
make nails, if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it,
will scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred
nails in a day, and those too very bad ones. A smith who has been accus-
tomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been
that of a nailer, can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than
eighthundredorathousandnailsinaday. Ihaveseenseveralboysunder
twenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of
making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each
ofthem,upwardsoftwothousandthreehundrednailsinaday. Themak-
ing of a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The
samepersonblowsthebellows,stirsormendsthefireasthereisoccasion,
heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: In forging the head too
he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the
making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much
moresimple, andthedexterityoftheperson, ofwhoselifeithasbeenthe
solebusinesstoperformthem,isusuallymuchgreater. Therapiditywith
which some of the operations of those manufacturers are performed, ex-
ceedswhatthehumanhandcould, bythosewhohadneverseenthem, be
supposedcapableofacquiring.
18 [7] Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly
lost in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we
should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very
quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a different
place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a
small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the
field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades can be carried G.ed.p19
on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is no doubt much less. It is
eveninthiscase,however,veryconsiderable. Amancommonlysauntersa

considerablythequantityofworkwhichheiscapableofperforming.
19 [8] Thirdly, and lastly, every body must be sensible how much labour is
11 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is un-
necessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the G.ed.p20
inventionofallthosemachinesbywhichlabourissomuchfacilitatedand
abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.
Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of at-
taining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed
towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great vari-
ety of things. But in consequence of the division of labour, the whole of
every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some one
very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that some
one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of la-
bour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their
own particular work, wherever the nature of it admits of such improve-
ment. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures
inwhichlabourismostsubdivided,wereoriginallytheinventionsofcom-
mon workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple
operation, naturallyturnedtheirthoughtstowardsfindingouteasierand
readier methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed
to visit such manufactures, must frequently have been shown very pretty
machines, which were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facil-
itate and quicken their own particular part of the work. In the first fire-
engines, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the
communication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the pis-
ton either ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play
with his companions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of
the valve, which opened this communication, to another part of the ma-
chine, the valve would open and shut without his assistance, and leave
him at liberty to divert himself with his play-fellows. One of the greatest
improvements that has been made upon this machine, since it was first G.ed.p21
invented, was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save
hisownlabour.
20 [9] All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been
the inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many im-
provements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the ma-
chines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and
some by that of those who are called philosophers or men of speculation,
whosetradeitis,nottodoanything,buttoobserveeverything;andwho,
upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers of
the most distant and dissimilar objects. In the progress of society, philo-
sophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the principal
or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens. Like every
other employment too, it is subdivided into a great number of different
branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of G.ed.p22
philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in philosophy, as well
asineveryotherbusiness,improvesdexterity,andsavestime. Eachindi-

[10] It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different
21

22
labourer in a civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that
the number of people of whose industry a part, though but a small part,
hasbeenemployedinprocuringhimthisaccommodation,exceedsallcom-
putation. The woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer,
as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour
of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool,
thewool-comberorcarder,thedyer,thescribbler,thespinner,theweaver,
the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different arts
in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants G.ed.p23
and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the ma-
terialsfromsomeofthoseworkmentootherswhooftenliveinaverydis-

of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world!
What a variety of labour too is necessary in order to produce the tools of
the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated ma-
chines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of
the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in
order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which the shep-

OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES
OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR
23 [1] THISdivisionoflabour,fromwhichsomanyadvantagesarederived,isnot

slow and gradual consequence of a certain propensity in human nature
whichhasinviewnosuchextensiveutility;thepropensitytotruck,barter,
andexchangeonethingforanother.
[2] Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human
24
nature, of which no further account can be given; or whether, as seems
more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason
and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to inquire. It is common
to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals, which seem to
know neither this nor any other species of contracts. Two greyhounds, in

however,isnottheeffectofanycontract,butoftheaccidentalconcurrence G.ed.p26

butcher,thebrewer,orthebaker,thatweexpectourdinner,butfromtheir
regardtotheirowninterest. Weaddressourselves, nottotheirhumanity
but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of
their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chuses to depend chiefly upon the
benevolence of his fellow-citizens. Even a beggar does not depend upon
it entirely. The charity of well-disposed people, indeed, supplies him with
the whole fund of his subsistence. But though this principle ultimately
provides him with all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for, it
neither does nor can provide him with them as he has occasion for them.

25 [3] As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one
another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in
need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives oc-
casion to the division of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds a par-
ticular person makes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness
and dexterity than any other. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or
for venison with his companions; and he finds at last that he can in this
mannergetmorecattleandvenisonthanifhehimselfwenttothefieldto
catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of
bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of
armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little G.ed.p28
huts or movable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his
neighbours,whorewardhiminthesamemannerwithcattleandwithven-
ison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this
employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same man-
ner a third becomes a smith or a brazier, a fourth a tanner or dresser of
hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the
certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of
his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such
parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he may have occasion for,
encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to

cultivateandbringtoperfectionwhatevertalentorgeniushemaypossess
forthatparticularspeciesofbusiness.
26 [4] The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much
less than we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears
todistinguishmenofdifferentprofessions, whengrownuptomaturity, is
notuponmanyoccasionssomuchthecause,astheeffectofthedivisionof
labour. The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a
philosopherandacommonstreetporter,forexample,seemstoarisenotso G.ed.p29
muchfromnature,asfromhabit,custom,andeducation. Whentheycame
into the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence, they
were,perhaps,verymuchalike,andneithertheirparentsnorplay-fellows
could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after,
they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference
of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till
at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any
resemblance. But without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange,
everymanmusthaveprocuredtohimselfeverynecessaryandconveniency
of life which he wanted. All must have had the same duties to perform,
and the same work to do, and there could have been no such difference of
employmentascouldalonegiveoccasiontoanygreatdifferenceoftalents.
27 [5] As it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so re-
markable among men of different professions, so it is this same dispos-
ition which renders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals ac-
knowledgedtobeallofthesamespecies,derivefromnatureamuchmore
remarkable distinction of genius, than what, antecedent to custom and
education, appears to take place among men. By nature a philosopher is G.ed.p30
not in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter, as a
mastiff is from a greyhound, or a greyhound from a spaniel, or this last
fromashepherd’sdog. Thosedifferenttribesofanimals, however, though
allofthesamespecies,areofscarceanyusetooneanother. Thestrength
of the mastiff is not, in the least, supported either by the swiftness of the
greyhound,orbythesagacityofthespaniel,orbythedocilityoftheshep-
herd’s dog. The effects of those different geniuses and talents, for want of
the power or disposition to barter and exchange, cannot be brought into a
commonstock,anddonotintheleastcontributetothebetteraccommoda-

THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS
LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE
MARKET
28 [1] AS it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of la-
bour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent
of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When the
market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate
himselfentirelytooneemployment,forwantofthepowertoexchangeall
thatsurpluspartoftheproduceofhisownlabour,whichisoverandabove
his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour
ashehasoccasionfor.
29 [2] Therearesomesortsofindustry,evenofthelowestkind,whichcanbe

ployment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much too nar-
rowasphereforhim;evenanordinarymarkettownisscarcelargeenough
to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very small vil-
lages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the Highlands
of Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker and brewer for his own
family. Insuchsituationswecanscarceexpecttofindevenasmith,acar-
penter, or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another of the same
trade. The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles distance from
the nearest of them must learn to perform themselves a great number of
littlepiecesofwork,forwhich,inmorepopulouscountries,theywouldcall
in the assistance of those workmen. Country workmen are almost every- G.ed.p32
whereobligedtoapplythemselvestoallthedifferentbranchesofindustry

sort of materials. A country carpenter deals in every sort of work that is
made of wood: a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron.
Theformerisnotonlyacarpenter,butajoiner,acabinet-maker,andeven
a carver in wood, as well as a wheel-wright, a plough-wright, a cart and
waggon maker. The employments of the latter are still more various. It
is impossible there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the
remoteandinlandpartsoftheHighlandsofScotland. Suchaworkmanat
therateofathousandnailsaday,andthreehundredworkingdaysinthe TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
year, will make three hundred thousand nails in the year. But in such a
situationitwouldbeimpossibletodisposeofonethousand,thatis,ofone

30 [3] As by means of water-carriage a more extensive market is opened to
every sort of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is
uponthesea-coast,andalongthebanksofnavigablerivers,thatindustry
of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is
frequentlynottillalongtimeafterthatthoseimprovementsextendthem-
selves to the inland parts of the country. A broad-wheeled waggon, atten-
ded by two men, and drawn by eight horses, in about six weeks’ time car-
riesandbringsbackbetweenLondonandEdinburghnearfourtonweight G.ed.p33
of goods. In about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men,
andsailingbetweentheportsofLondonandLeith,frequentlycarriesand
brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six or eight men, there-
fore, by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring back in the same
time the same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh, as fifty
broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four
hundredhorses. Upontwohundredtonsofgoods,therefore,carriedbythe
cheapestland-carriagefromLondontoEdinburgh,theremustbecharged
themaintenanceofahundredmenforthreeweeks,andboththemainten-
ance, and, what is nearly equal to the maintenance, the wear and tear of
four hundred horses as well as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the
same quantity of goods carried by water, there is to be charged only the
maintenance of six or eight men, and the wear and tear of a ship of two
hundred tons burden, together with the value of the superior risk, or the
difference of the insurance between land and water-carriage. Were there

31 [4] Sincesuch,therefore,aretheadvantagesofwater-carriage,itisnatural
thatthefirstimprovementsofartandindustryshouldbemadewherethis
conveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every
sort of labour, and that they should always be much later in extending
themselves into the inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the
19 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part
of their goods, but the country which lies round about them, and separ-
ates them from the sea-coast, and the great navigable rivers. The extent
of their market, therefore, must for a long time be in proportion to the
riches and populousness of that country, and consequently their improve-
mentmustalwaysbeposteriortotheimprovementofthatcountry. Inour
North American colonies the plantations have constantly followed either
the sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have scarce any-
whereextendedthemselvestoanyconsiderabledistancefromboth.
32 [5] The nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear
to have been first civilised, were those that dwelt round the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in
theworld,havingnotides,norconsequentlyanywavesexceptsuchasare
caused by the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well
as by the multitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring
shores, extremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when,
from their ignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of
thecoast,andfromtheimperfectionoftheartofshipbuilding,toabandon
themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond the pil-
lars of Hercules, that is, to sail out of the Straits of Gibraltar, was, in the
ancientworld,longconsideredasamostwonderfulanddangerousexploit
ofnavigation. ItwaslatebeforeeventhePhoeniciansandCarthaginians,
themostskilfulnavigatorsandship-buildersofthoseoldtimes,attempted
it,andtheywereforalongtimetheonlynationsthatdidattemptit.
33 [6] OfallthecountriesonthecoastoftheMediterraneanSea,Egyptseems
to have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were
cultivatedandimprovedtoanyconsiderabledegree. UpperEgyptextends G.ed.p35
itself nowhere above a few miles from the Nile, and in Lower Egypt that
great river breaks itself into many different canals, which, with the as-
sistance of a little art, seem to have afforded a communication by water-
carriage, not only between all the great towns, but between all the con-
siderablevillages,andeventomanyfarmhousesinthecountry; nearlyin
the same manner as the Rhine and the Maas do in Holland at present.
Theextentandeasinessofthisinlandnavigationwasprobablyoneofthe
principalcausesoftheearlyimprovementofEgypt.
34 [7] The improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to
have been of very great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East
Indies,andinsomeoftheeasternprovincesofChina;thoughthegreatex-
tentofthisantiquityisnotauthenticatedbyanyhistoriesofwhoseauthor-
ity we, in this part of the world, are well assured. In Bengal the Ganges
andseveralothergreatriversformagreatnumberofnavigablecanalsin
the same manner as the Nile does in Egypt. In the Eastern provinces of
China too, several great rivers form, by their different branches, a multi-
tude of canals, and by communicating with one another afford an inland
navigationmuchmoreextensivethanthateitheroftheNileortheGanges,
20 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
or perhaps than both of them put together. It is remarkable that neither
the ancient Egyptians, nor the Indians, nor the Chinese, encouraged for-
eigncommerce,butseemalltohavederivedtheirgreatopulencefromthis
inlandnavigation.
35 [8] All the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies
any considerable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient G.ed.p36
Scythia, the modern Tartary and Siberia, seem in all ages of the world to
have been in the same barbarous and uncivilised state in which we find
them at present. The Sea of Tartary is the frozen ocean which admits of
no navigation, and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run
throughthatcountry,theyareattoogreatadistancefromoneanotherto
carry commerce and communication through the greater part of it. There
are in Africa none of those great inlets, such as the Baltic and Adriatic
seas in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in both Europe and
Asia, and the gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam, in Asia, to
carry maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent:
andthegreatriversofAfricaareattoogreatadistancefromoneanother
to give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce be-
sides which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not
break itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs
into another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very consid-
erable; because it is always in the power of the nations who possess that
other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper country
and the sea. The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to the dif-
ferent states of Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, in comparison of what it
would be if any of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into
theBlackSea.
21 CHAPTER IV
G.ed.p37
OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONEY
36 [1] WHEN the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is
butaverysmallpartofaman’swantswhichtheproduceofhisownlabour
can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that
surpluspartoftheproduceofhisownlabour,whichisoverandabovehis
ownconsumption,forsuchpartsoftheproduceofothermen’slabourashe
hasoccasionfor. Everymanthuslivesbyexchanging,orbecomesinsome
measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a
commercialsociety.
37 [2] But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power
of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embar-
rassed in its operations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a cer-
tain commodity than he himself has occasion for, while another has less.
The former consequently would be glad to dispose of, and the latter to
purchase, a part of this superfluity. But if this latter should chance to
have nothing that the former stands in need of, no exchange can be made
between them. The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself
canconsume,andthebrewerandthebakerwouldeachofthembewilling
to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, ex-
cept the different productions of their respective trades, and the butcher
is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate
occasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He
cannotbetheirmerchant,northeyhiscustomers;andtheyareallofthem
thusmutuallylessserviceabletooneanother. Inordertoavoidtheincon-
veniency of such situations, every prudent man in every period of society,

ityofsomeonecommodityorother,suchasheimaginedfewpeoplewould
belikelytorefuseinexchangefortheproduceoftheirindustry.
38 [3] Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both
thoughtofandemployedforthispurpose. Intherudeagesofsociety,cattle
are said to have been the common instrument of commerce; and, though
they must have been a most inconvenient one, yet in old times we find
thingswerefrequentlyvaluedaccordingtothenumberofcattlewhichhad TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
been given in exchange for them. The armour of Diomede, says Homer,
costonlynineoxen;butthatofGlaucuscostanhundredoxen. Saltissaid

dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at this day a village
in Scotland where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to carry
nailsinsteadofmoneytothebaker’sshoporthealehouse.
39 [4] Inallcountries,however,menseematlasttohavebeendeterminedby
irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals
aboveeveryothercommodity. Metalscannotonlybekeptwithaslittleloss
as any other commodity, scarce anything being less perishable than they G.ed.p39
are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number
of parts, as by fusion those parts can easily be reunited again; a quality
whichnootherequallydurablecommoditiespossess,andwhichmorethan
anyotherqualityrendersthemfittobetheinstrumentsofcommerceand
circulation. Themanwhowantedtobuysalt,forexample,andhadnothing
butcattle togivein exchangefor it, musthavebeen obligedtobuy saltto
the value of a whole ox, or a whole sheep at a time. He could seldom buy
less than this, because what he was to give for it could seldom be divided
without loss; and if he had a mind to buy more, he must, for the same
reasons, have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity, the value,
to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or three sheep. If, on the contrary,
insteadofsheeporoxen,hehadmetalstogiveinexchangeforit,hecould
easily proportion the quantity of the metal to the precise quantity of the
commoditywhichhehadimmediateoccasionfor.
40 [5] Different metals have been made use of by different nations for this
purpose. Ironwasthecommoninstrumentofcommerceamongtheancient
Spartans; copper among the ancient Romans; and gold and silver among
allrichandcommercialnations.
[6] Thosemetalsseemoriginallytohavebeenmadeuseofforthispurpose
41
in rude bars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny1,
upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient historian, that, till the time of
Servius Tullius, the Romans had no coined money, but made use of un-
stampedbarsofcopper,topurchasewhatevertheyhadoccasionfor. These
bars,therefore,performedatthistimethefunctionofmoney.
[7] Theuseofmetalsinthisrudestatewasattendedwithtwoveryconsid-
42
erable inconveniencies; first, with the trouble of weighing; and, secondly,
with that of assaying them. In the precious metals, where a small dif-
ference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value, even the G.ed.p40
business of weighing, with proper exactness, requires at least very accur-
ateweightsandscales. Theweighingofgoldinparticularisanoperation
of some nicety. In the coarser metals, indeed, where a small error would
1[Smith]Plin.Hist.Nat.lib.33cap.3.
23 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
be of little consequence, less accuracy would, no doubt, be necessary. Yet
we should find it excessively troublesome, if every time a poor man had
occasion either to buy or sell a farthing’s worth of goods, he was obliged
to weigh the farthing. The operation of assaying is still more difficult,
still more tedious, and, unless a part of the metal is fairly melted in the
crucible, with proper dissolvents, any conclusion that can be drawn from
it, is extremely uncertain. Before the institution of coined money, how-
ever,unlesstheywentthroughthistediousanddifficultoperation,people
must always have been liable to the grossest frauds and impositions, and
instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or pure copper, might receive
in exchange for their goods an adulterated composition of the coarsest
andcheapestmaterials,whichhad,however,intheiroutwardappearance,
beenmadetoresemblethosemetals. Topreventsuchabuses, tofacilitate
exchanges, and thereby to encourage all sorts of industry and commerce,
ithasbeenfoundnecessary,inallcountriesthathavemadeanyconsider-
able advances towards improvement, to affix a public stamp upon certain
quantities of such particular metals as were in those countries commonly
made use of to purchase goods. Hence the origin of coined money, and of
those public offices called mints; institutions exactly of the same nature
with those of the aulnagers and stamp-masters of woolen and linen cloth.
All of them are equally meant to ascertain, by means of a public stamp, G.ed.p41
the quantity and uniform goodness of those different commodities when
broughttomarket.
43 [8] The first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current
metals, seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it
was both most difficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or
fineness of the metal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is
at present affixed to plate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which
is sometimes affixed to ingots of gold, and which being struck only upon
one side of the piece, and not covering the whole surface, ascertains the
fineness, but not the weight of the metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the
four hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of
Machpelah. They are said, however, to be the current money of the mer-
chant,andyetarereceivedbyweightandnotbytale,inthesamemanner
as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The revenues of the
ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not in money
but in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts. William the
Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This money,

45 [10] Thedenominationsofthosecoinsseemoriginallytohaveexpressedthe
weightorquantityofmetalcontainedinthem. InthetimeofServiusTul-
lius, who first coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a
Roman pound of good copper. It was divided in the same manner as our
Troyes pound, into twelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce
of good copper. The English pound sterling, in the time of Edward I, con-
tained a pound, Tower weight, of silver, of a known fineness. The Tower
pound seems to have been something more than the Roman pound, and
something less than the Troyes pound. This last was not introduced into
the mint of England till the 18th of Henry VIII. The French livre con-
tained in the time of Charlemagne a pound, Troyes weight, of silver of a
known fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time fre-
quented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of so
famous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money
pound contained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert
Bruce, a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the Eng-
lishpoundsterling. English,French,andScotspennies,too,containedall
of them originally a real pennyweight of silver, the twentieth part of an
ounce,andthetwo-hundred-and-fortiethpartofapound. Theshillingtoo
seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight. When wheat

ancient Saxons a shilling appears at one time to have contained only five
pennies,anditisnotimprobablethatitmayhavebeenasvariableamong
them as among their neighbours, the ancient Franks. From the time of
Charlemagne among the French, and from that of William the Conqueror
among the English, the proportion between the pound, the shilling, and
the penny, seems to have been uniformly the same as at present, though
thevalueofeachhasbeenverydifferent. Forineverycountryoftheworld,
I believe, the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states, abus-
ing the confidence of their subjects, have by degrees diminished the real
quantityofmetal,whichhadbeenoriginallycontainedintheircoins. The
Roman as, in the latter ages of the Republic, was reduced to the twenty-
fourthpartofitsoriginalvalue,and,insteadofweighingapound,cameto
weighonlyhalfanounce. TheEnglishpoundandpennycontainatpresent
aboutathirdonly;theScotspoundandpennyaboutathirty-sixth;andthe
French pound and penny about a sixty-sixth part of their original value.
By means of those operations the princes and sovereign states which per- G.ed.p44
25 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
formed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay their debts and to fulfil
theirengagementswithasmallerquantityofsilverthanwouldotherwise
have been requisite. It was indeed in appearance only; for their creditors
werereallydefraudedofapartofwhatwasduetothem. Allotherdebtors
inthestatewereallowedthesameprivilege,andmightpaywiththesame
nominal sum of the new and debased coin whatever they had borrowed
in the old. Such operations, therefore, have always proved favourable to
the debtor, and ruinous to the creditor, and have sometimes produced a
greater and more universal revolution in the fortunes of private persons,
thancouldhavebeenoccasionedbyaverygreatpubliccalamity.
46 [11] Itis inthismanner thatmoneyhas becomeinall civilisednationsthe
universal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of
allkindsareboughtandsold,orexchangedforoneanother.
47 [12] What are the rules which men naturally observe in exchanging them
eitherformoneyorforoneanother,Ishallnowproceedtoexamine. These
rules determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of
goods.
48 [13] Theword VALUE, itis tobeobserved, has twodifferentmeanings, and
sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes
the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object
conveys. Theonemaybecalled‘valueinuse;’theother,‘valueinexchange.’
The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or
novalueinexchange; and, onthecontrary, thosewhichhavethegreatest
value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is
more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any
thingcanbehadinexchangeforit. Adiamond,onthecontrary,hasscarce G.ed.p45
any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently
behadinexchangeforit.

50 [15] First,whatistherealmeasureofthisexchangeablevalue;or,wherein
consiststherealpriceofallcommodities,
51 [16] Secondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is com-

52 [17] And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes
raise some or all of these different parts of price above, and sometimes
sink them below their natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes
whichsometimeshinderthemarketprice,thatis,theactualpriceofcom-
modities, from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural

therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or
consumeithimself,buttoexchangeitforothercommodities,isequaltothe
quantityoflabourwhichitenableshimtopurchaseorcommand. Labour,
therefore,istherealmeasureoftheexchangeablevalueofallcommodities.
55 [2] The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man
who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What
everythingisreallyworthtothemanwhohasacquiredit,andwhowants
to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble
which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people.
Whatisboughtwithmoneyorwithgoodsispurchasedbylabourasmuch
aswhatweacquirebythetoilofourownbody. Thatmoneyorthosegoods
indeed save us this toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of
labour which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain G.ed.p48
the value of an equal quantity. Labour was the first price, the original
purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by
silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally pur-
chased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange
it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labour
whichitcanenablethemtopurchaseorcommand.
56 [3] Wealth, as Mr. Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either ac-
quires, orsucceeds to a great fortune, does notnecessarily acquireor suc-
ceed to any political power, either civil or military. His fortune may, per-
haps, afford him the means of acquiring both, but the mere possession of
that fortune does not necessarily convey to him either. The power which TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
that possession immediately and directly conveys to him, is the power of
purchasing;acertaincommandoverallthelabour,oroveralltheproduce
of labour, which is then in the market. His fortune is greater or less, pre-
ciselyinproportiontotheextentofthispower;ortothequantityeitherof
othermen’slabour,or,whatisthesamething,oftheproduceofothermen’s
labour, which it enables him to purchase or command. The exchangeable
value of everything must always be precisely equal to the extent of this
powerwhichitconveystoitsowner.
57 [4] Butthoughlabourbetherealmeasureoftheexchangeablevalueofall

however,notbyanyaccuratemeasure,butbythehigglingandbargaining
of the market, according to that sort of rough equality which, though not
exact,issufficientforcarryingonthebusinessofcommonlife.
58 [5] Every commodity, besides, is more frequently exchanged for, and
thereby compared with, other commodities than with labour. It is more
natural, therefore, to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of
some other commodity than by that of the labour which it can purchase.
The greater part of people, too, understand better what is meant by a
quantityofaparticularcommoditythanbyaquantityoflabour. Theoneis
aplainpalpableobject; theotheranabstractnotion, which, thoughitcan
bemadesufficientlyintelligible,isnotaltogethersonaturalandobvious.
59 [6] But when barter ceases, and money has become the common instru-
ment of commerce, every particular commodity is more frequently ex-
changedformoneythanforanyothercommodity. Thebutcherseldomcar-
rieshisbeeforhismuttontothebaker,orthebrewer,inordertoexchange

changes them for money, and afterwards exchanges that money for bread
and for beer. The quantity of money which he gets for them regulates,
too, the quantity of bread and beer which he can afterwards purchase. It
is more natural and obvious to him, therefore, to estimate their value by
thequantityofmoney,thecommodityforwhichheimmediatelyexchanges
them,thanbythatofbreadandbeer,thecommoditiesforwhichhecanex-
change them only by the intervention of another commodity; and rather
to say that his butcher’s meat is worth threepence or fourpence a pound,

ofsmallbeer. Henceitcomestopassthattheexchangeablevalueofevery
commodityismorefrequentlyestimatedbythequantityofmoney,thanby
the quantity either of labour or of any other commodity which can be had
inexchangeforit.
60 [7] Gold and silver, however, like every other commodity, vary in their
value, are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer, sometimes of easier
and sometimes of more difficult purchase. The quantity of labour which
anyparticularquantityofthemcanpurchaseorcommand,orthequantity
of other goods which it will exchange for, depends always upon the fertil-
ity or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time
when such exchanges are made. The discovery of the abundant mines of
America reduced, in the sixteenth century, the value of gold and silver in
Europe to about a third of what it had been before. As it costs less labour
to bring those metals from the mine to the market, so when they were G.ed.p50
brought thither they could purchase or command less labour; and this re-
volution in their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the
onlyoneofwhichhistorygivessomeaccount. Butasameasureofquantity,
such as the natural foot, fathom, or handful, which is continually varying
in its own quantity, can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of
otherthings;soacommoditywhichisitselfcontinuallyvaryinginitsown
value, can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodit-
ies. Equalquantitiesoflabour,atalltimesandplaces,maybesaidtobeof
equal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength and
spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must always
laydown the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and his happiness. The
pricewhichhepaysmustalwaysbethesame,whatevermaybethequant-
ity of goods which he receives in return for it. Of these, indeed, it may
sometimespurchaseagreaterandsometimesasmallerquantity;butitis
theirvaluewhichvaries,notthatofthelabourwhichpurchasesthem. At
alltimesandplacesthatisdearwhichitisdifficulttocomeat,orwhichit
costs much labour to acquire; and that cheap which is to be had easily, or G.ed.p51
with very little labour. Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own
value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all
commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is
theirrealprice;moneyistheirnominalpriceonly.
61 [8] But though equal quantities of labour are always of equal value to the
labourer,yettothepersonwhoemployshimtheyappearsometimestobe

62 [9] In this popular sense, therefore, labour, like commodities, may be said
tohavearealandanominalprice. Itsrealpricemaybesaidtoconsistin

63 [10] Thedistinctionbetweentherealandthenominalpriceofcommodities
and labour is not a matter of mere speculation, but may sometimes be of
considerable use in practice. The same real price is always of the same
value; but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver, the
same nominal price is sometimes of very different values. When a landed
estate,therefore,issoldwithareservationofaperpetualrent,ifitisinten-
ded that this rent should always be of the same value, it is of importance
to the family in whose favour it is reserved that it should not consist in a
particularsumofmoney. Itsvaluewouldinthiscasebeliabletovariations

itiesofgoldandsilverwhicharecontainedatdifferenttimesincoinofthe

64 [11] Princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a
temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in G.ed.p52
theircoins;buttheyseldomhavefanciedthattheyhadanytoaugmentit.
The quantity of metal contained in the coins, I believe of all nations, has,
accordingly, been almost continually diminishing, and hardly ever aug-
menting. Such variations, therefore, tend almost always to diminish the
valueofamoneyrent.
65 [12] The discovery of the mines of America diminished the value of gold
and silver in Europe. This diminution, it is commonly supposed, though
I apprehend without any certain proof, is still going on gradually, and is
likelytocontinuetodosoforalongtime. Uponthissupposition,therefore,
such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the value of
a money rent, even though it should be stipulated to be paid, not in such
a quantity of coined money of such a denomination (in so many pounds
sterling, for example), but in so many ounces either of pure silver, or of
silverofacertainstandard.
66 [13] Therentswhichhavebeenreservedincornhavepreservedtheirvalue
much better than those which have been reserved in money, even where
the denomination of the coin has not been altered. By the 18th of Eliza-
beth it was enacted that a third of the rent of all college leases should be
reserved in corn, to be paid, either in kind, or according to the current
prices at the nearest public market. The money arising from this corn
rent,thoughoriginallybutathirdofthewhole,isinthepresenttimes,ac-
cording to Dr. Blackstone, commonly near double of what arises from the
other two-thirds. The old money rents of colleges must, according to this
account, have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value; or are
worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly
worth. But since the reign of Philip and Mary the denomination of the
English coin has undergone little or no alteration, and the same number
31 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ofpounds,shillingsandpencehavecontainedverynearlythesamequant-
ity of pure silver. This degradation, therefore, in the value of the money
rents of colleges, has arisen altogether from the degradation in the value
ofsilver.
67 [14] When the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the di-
minutionofthequantityofitcontainedinthecoinofthesamedenomina-
tion,thelossisfrequentlystillgreater. InScotland,wherethedenomina- G.ed.p53

England, and in France, where it has undergone still greater than it ever
didinScotland, someancientrents, originallyofconsiderablevalue, have
inthismannerbeenreducedalmosttonothing.
68 [15] Equal quantities of labour will at distant times be purchased more
nearlywithequalquantitiesofcorn, thesubsistenceofthelabourer, than
withequalquantitiesofgoldandsilver,orperhapsofanyothercommodity.
Equalquantitiesofcorn,therefore,will,atdistanttimes,bemorenearlyof
thesamerealvalue,orenablethepossessortopurchaseorcommandmore
nearly the same quantity of the labour of other people. They will do this,
I say, more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other commodity;
for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly. The subsistence of
thelabourer,ortherealpriceoflabour,asIshallendeavourtoshowhere-
after, is very different upon different occasions; more liberal in a society
advancing to opulence than in one that is standing still; and in one that
is standing still than in one that is going backwards. Every other com-
modity,however,willatanyparticulartimepurchaseagreaterorsmaller

69 [16] Thoughtherealvalueofacornrent,itistobeobserved,however,var-
iesmuchlessfromcenturytocenturythanthatofamoneyrent, itvaries
muchmorefromyeartoyear. Themoneypriceoflabour,asIshallendeav-
ourtoshowhereafter,doesnotfluctuatefromyeartoyearwiththemoney
price of corn, but seems to be everywhere accommodated, not to the tem-
poraryoroccasional,buttotheaverageorordinarypriceofthatnecessary

likewiseendeavourtoshowhereafter,bythevalueofsilver,bytherichness
orbarrennessofthemineswhichsupplythemarketwiththatmetal,orby
the quantity of labour which must be employed, and consequently of corn
whichmustbeconsumed,inordertobringanyparticularquantityofsilver G.ed.p54
fromtheminetothemarket. Butthevalueofsilver,thoughitsometimes
varies greatly from century to century, seldom varies much from year to
year, but frequently continues the same, or very nearly the same, for half
32 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a century or a century together. The ordinary or average money price of
corn, therefore, may, during so long a period, continue the same or very
nearlythesametoo,andalongwithitthemoneypriceoflabour,provided,
at least, the society continues, in other respects, in the same or nearly in
the same condition. In the meantime the temporary and occasional price
of corn may frequently be double, one year, of what it had been the year
before,orfluctuate,forexample,fromfiveandtwentytofiftyshillingsthe

We cannot estimate, it is allowed, the real value of different commodities
from century to century by the quantities of silver which were given for
them. We cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities of corn.
By the quantities of labour we can, with the greatest accuracy, estimate
it both from century to century and from year to year. From century to
century, corn is a better measure than silver, because, from century to
century,equalquantitiesofcornwillcommandthesamequantityoflabour
more nearly than equal quantities of silver. From year to year, on the

72 [19] At the same time and place the real and the nominal price of all com-
moditiesareexactlyinproportiontooneanother. Themoreorlessmoney

mand. Atthesametimeandplace,therefore,moneyistheexactmeasure
oftherealexchangeablevalueofallcommodities. Itisso,however,atthe
sametimeandplaceonly.
73 [20] Though at distant places, there is no regular proportion between the
real and the money price of commodities, yet the merchant who carries
goods from the one to the other has nothing to consider but their money
price, or the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys
them, and that for which he is likely to sell them. Half an ounce of silver
at Canton in China may command a greater quantity both of labour and
of the necessaries and conveniences of life than an ounce at London. A
commodity,therefore,whichsellsforhalfanounceofsilveratCantonmay
therebereallydearer,ofmorerealimportancetothemanwhopossessesit
33 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
there,thanacommoditywhichsellsforanounceatLondonistotheman
who possesses it at London. If a London merchant, however, can buy at
Canton for half an ounce of silver, a commodity which he can afterwards
sell at London for an ounce, he gains a hundred per cent by the bargain,
just as much as if an ounce of silver was at London exactly of the same
value as at Canton. It is of no importance to him that half an ounce of
silver at Canton would have given him the command of more labour and
of a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life than an
ounce can do at London. An ounce at London will always give him the
command of double the quantity of all these which half an ounce could
havedonethere,andthisispreciselywhathewants.
74 [21] As it is the nominal or money price of goods, therefore, which finally
determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and sales, and
therebyregulatesalmostthewholebusinessofcommonlifeinwhichprice
is concerned, we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more
attendedtothantherealprice.
75 [22] Insuchaworkasthis,however,itmaysometimesbeofusetocompare
the different real values of a particular commodity at different times and
places, or the different degrees of power over the labour of other people
whichitmay, upondifferentoccasions, havegiventothosewhopossessed
it. We must in this case compare, not so much the different quantities of
silverforwhichitwascommonlysold,asthedifferentquantitiesoflabour
which those different quantities of silver could have purchased. But the G.ed.p56
current prices of labour at distant times and places can scarce ever be
known with any degree of exactness. Those of corn, though they have
in few places been regularly recorded, are in general better known and
havebeenmorefrequentlytakennoticeofbyhistoriansandotherwriters.
We must generally, therefore, content ourselves with them, not as being
always exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of labour, but
as being the nearest approximation which can commonly be had to that
proportion. Ishallhereafterhaveoccasiontomakeseveralcomparisonsof
thiskind.
76 [23] In the progress of industry, commercial nations have found it conveni-
ent to coin several different metals into money; gold for larger payments,
silver for purchases of moderate value, and copper, or some other coarse
metal,forthoseofstillsmallerconsideration. Theyhavealways,however,
considered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of value
than any of the other two; and this preference seems generally to have
been given to the metal which they happened first to make use of as the
instrument of commerce. Having once begun to use it as their standard,
whichtheymusthavedonewhentheyhadnoothermoney,theyhavegen-
erallycontinuedtodosoevenwhenthenecessitywasnotthesame.

Copper,therefore,appearstohavecontinuedalwaysthemeasureofvalue

value of all estates to have been computed either in Asses or in Sestertii.
Theaswasalwaysthedenominationofacoppercoin. ThewordSestertius

ginallyasilvercoin, itsvaluewasestimatedincopper. AtRome, onewho

78 [25] Thenorthernnationswhoestablishedthemselvesupontheruinsofthe

their settlements, and not to have known either gold or copper coins for
several ages thereafter. There were silver coins in England in the time of
theSaxons;buttherewaslittlegoldcoinedtillthetimeofEdwardIIInor G.ed.p47

for the same reason, I believe, in all other modern nations of Europe, all

79 [26] Originally,inallcountries,Ibelieve,alegaltenderofpaymentcouldbe
madeonlyinthecoinofthatmetal,whichwaspeculiarlyconsideredasthe
standard or measure of value. In England, gold was not considered as a
legaltenderforalongtimeafteritwascoinedintomoney. Theproportion
between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by any public
law or proclamation; but was left to be settled by the market. If a debtor
offered payment in gold, the creditor might either reject such payment
altogether, or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he and his
debtorcouldagreeupon. Copperisnotatpresentalegaltenderexceptin

80 [27] Inprocessoftime, andaspeoplebecamegraduallymorefamiliarwith
theuseofthedifferentmetalsincoin,andconsequentlybetteracquainted
with the proportion between their respective values, it has in most coun-

declare by a public law that a guinea, for example, of such a weight and
fineness,shouldexchangeforone-and-twentyshillings,orbealegaltender

Silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold. Silver
would appear to measure the value of gold, and gold would not appear to
measurethevalueofsilver. Thevalueofgoldwouldseemtodependupon
the quantity of silver which it would exchange for; and the value of sil-
ver would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which it would
exchange for. This difference, however, would be altogether owing to the
customofkeepingaccounts,andofexpressingtheamountofallgreatand
small sums rather in silver than in gold money. One of Mr. Drummond’s
notesforfive-and-twentyorfiftyguineaswould,afteranalterationofthis
kind, be still payable with five-and-twenty or fifty guineas in the same
manner as before. It would, after such an alteration, be payable with the
samequantityofgoldasbefore,butwithverydifferentquantitiesofsilver.
Inthepaymentofsuchanote,goldwouldappeartobemoreinvariablein

and silver would not appear to measure the value of gold. If the custom

82 [29] In reality, during the continuance of any one regulated proportion
between the respective values of the different metals in coin, the value
of the most precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin. Twelve
copper pence contain half a pound, avoirdupois, of copper, of not the best
quality,which,beforeitiscoined,isseldomworthsevenpenceinsilver. But
asbytheregulationtwelvesuchpenceareorderedtoexchangeforashil-
ling, they are in the market considered as worth a shilling, and a shilling
can at any time be had for them. Even before the late reformation of the

thegoldcoin. Inthemarket,however,one-and-twentyshillingsofthisde-
36 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
graded silver coin are still considered as worth a guinea of this excellent
goldcoin.
83 [30] The reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of the
silvercoinwhichcanbeexchangedforit.
84 [31] In the English mint a pound weight of gold is coined into forty-four
guineasandahalf,which,atone-and-twentyshillingstheguinea,isequal
toforty-sixpoundsfourteenshillingsandsixpence. Anounceofsuchgold
coin, therefore, is worth 3l.17s.101d. in silver. In England no duty or sei-
2
gnorage is paid upon the coinage, and he who carries a pound weight or
an ounce weight of standard gold bullion to the mint, gets back a pound
weight or an ounce weight of gold in coin, without any deduction. Three
poundsseventeenshillingsandtenpencehalfpennyanounce,therefore,is
said to be the mint price of gold in England, or the quantity of gold coin
whichthemintgivesinreturnforstandardgoldbullion.
85 [32] Before the reformation of the gold coin, the price of standard gold bul-
lioninthemarkethadformanyyearsbeenupwardsof3l.18s.sometimes
3l.19s. and very frequently 4l. an ounce; that sum, it is probable, in the
worn and degraded gold coin, seldom containing more than an ounce of
standard gold. Since the reformation of the gold coin, the market price of
standard gold bullion seldom exceeds 3l.17s.7d. an ounce. Before the re-
formationofthegoldcoin,themarketpricewasalwaysmoreorlessabove
the mint price. Since that reformation, the market price has been con-
stantly below the mint price. But that market price is the same whether
it is paid in gold or in silver coin. The late reformation of the gold coin,
therefore, has raised not only the value of the gold coin, but likewise that
of the silver coin in proportion to gold bullion, and probably, too, in pro-
portion to all other commodities; through the price of the greater part of
other commodities being influenced by so many other causes, the rise in
the value either of gold or silver coin in proportion to them may not be so
distinctandsensible.
86 [33] IntheEnglishmintapoundweightofstandardsilverbullioniscoined G.ed.p60

ofstandardsilver. Fiveshillingsandtwopenceanounce,therefore,issaid
to be the mint price of silver in England, or the quantity of silver coin
which the mint gives in return for standard silver bullion. Before the re-
formationofthegoldcoin,themarketpriceofstandardsilverbullionwas,
upon different occasions, five shillings and fourpence, five shillings and
fivepence, five shillings and sixpence, five shillings and sevenpence, and
very often five shillings and eightpence an ounce. Five shillings and sev-
enpence, however, seems to have been the most common price. Since the
reformation of the gold coin, the market price of standard silver bullion
has fallen occasionally to five shillings and threepence, five shillings and
fourpence,andfiveshillingsandfivepenceanounce,whichlastpriceithas

88 [35] Upon the reformation of the silver coin in the reign of William III the
priceofsilverbullionstillcontinuedtobesomewhatabovethemintprice.
Mr. Locke imputed this high price to the permission of exporting silver
bullion, and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin. This permission of
exporting,hesaid,renderedthedemandforsilverbulliongreaterthanthe
demandforsilvercoin. Butthenumberofpeoplewhowantsilvercoinfor
the common uses of buying and selling at home, is surely much greater G.ed.p61
thanthatofthosewhowantsilverbullioneitherfortheuseofexportation
orforanyotheruse. Theresubsistsatpresentalikepermissionofexport-
ing gold bullion, and a like prohibition of exporting gold coin: and yet the
price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint price. But in the English
coin silver was then, in the same manner as now, under-rated in propor-
tiontogold,andthegoldcoin(whichatthattimetoowasnotsupposedto
require any reformation) regulated then, as well as now, the real value of
the whole coin. As the reformation of the silver coin did not then reduce
the price of silver bullion to the mint price, it is not very probable that a
likereformationwilldosonow.
89 [36] Werethesilvercoinbroughtbackasneartoitsstandardweightasthe
gold, a guinea, it is probable, would, according to the present proportion,
exchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in bullion. The
silvercoincontainingitsfullstandardweight,therewouldinthiscasebe
a profit in melting it down, in order, first, to sell the bullion for gold coin,
andafterwardstoexchangethisgoldcoinforsilvercointobemelteddown
in the same manner. Some alteration in the present proportion seems to
betheonlymethodofpreventingthisinconveniency.
90 [37] Theinconveniencyperhapswouldbelessifsilverwasratedinthecoin
asmuchaboveitsproperproportiontogoldasitisatpresentratedbelow

legal tender for more than the change of a guinea, in the same manner
as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling. No
creditorcouldinthiscasebecheatedinconsequenceofthehighvaluation
of silver in coin; as no creditor can at present be cheated in consequence
38 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of the high valuation of copper. The bankers only would suffer by this
regulation. When a run comes upon them they sometimes endeavour to
gain time by paying in sixpences, and they would be precluded by this
regulationfromthisdiscreditablemethodofevadingimmediatepayment.
Theywouldbeobligedinconsequencetokeepatalltimesintheircoffersa
greater quantity of cash than at present; and though this might no doubt
be a considerable inconveniency to them, it would at the same time be a
considerablesecuritytotheircreditors.
91 [38] Three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny (the mint
priceofgold)certainlydoesnotcontain,eveninourpresentexcellentgold
coin, more than an ounce of standard gold, and it may be thought, there-
fore, should not purchase more standard bullion. But gold in coin is more G.ed.p62
convenient than gold in bullion, and though, in England, the coinage is
free, yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint can seldom be
returned in coin to the owner till after a delay of several weeks. In the
presenthurryofthemint,itcouldnotbereturnedtillafteradelayofsev-
eral months. This delay is equivalent to a small duty, and renders gold
in coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bul-
lion. If in the English coin silver was rated according to it proper propor-
tion to gold, the price of silver bullion would probably fall below the mint
priceevenwithoutanyreformationofthesilvercoin;thevalueevenofthe
present worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the value of the
excellentgoldcoinforwhichitcanbechanged.
92 [39] A small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver
would probably increase still more the superiority of those metals in coin
above an equal quantity of either of them in bullion. The coinage would
inthiscaseincreasethevalueofthemetalcoinedinproportiontotheex-
tentofthissmallduty; forthesamereasonthatthefashionincreasesthe

homeitwouldbuymorethanthatweight. Therewouldbeaprofit,there-
fore, in bringing it home again. In France a seignorage of about eight per
cent is imposed upon the coinage, and the French coin, when exported, is
saidtoreturnhomeagainofitsownaccord.
93 [40] The occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver bul-
lionarisefromthesamecausesasthelikefluctuationsinthatofallother
commodities. The frequent loss of those metals from various accidents by
seaandbyland,thecontinualwasteofthemingildingandplating,inlace
andembroidery,inthewearandtearofcoin,andinthatofplate;require, G.ed.p63
inallcountrieswhichpossessnominesoftheirown,acontinualimporta-
tion, in order to repair this loss and this waste. The merchant importers,
like all other merchants, we may believe, endeavour, as well as they can,
39 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to suit their occasional importations to what, they judge, is likely to be
theimmediatedemand. Withalltheirattention,however,theysometimes
overdo the business, and sometimes underdo it. When they import more
bullionthaniswanted,ratherthanincurtheriskandtroubleofexporting
it again, they are sometimes willing to sell a part of it for something less
thantheordinaryoraverageprice. When,ontheotherhand,theyimport
less than is wanted, they get something more than this price. But when,
under all those occasional fluctuations, the market price either of gold or
silverbullioncontinuesforseveralyearstogethersteadilyandconstantly,
either more or less above, or more or less below the mint price, we may
be assured that this steady and constant, either superiority or inferior-
ity of price, is the effect of something in the state of the coin, which, at
thattime,rendersacertainquantityofcoineitherofmorevalueorofless
value than the precise quantity of bullion which it ought to contain. The

94 [41] The money of any particular country is, at any particular time and
place, more or less an accurate measure of value according as the current
coin is more or less exactly agreeable to its standard, or contains more or
lessexactlytheprecisequantityofpuregoldorpuresilverwhichitought

tained exactly a pound weight of standard gold, or eleven ounces of fine
goldandoneounceofalloy,thegoldcoinofEnglandwouldbeasaccurate
a measure of the actual value of goods at any particular time and place
as the nature of the thing would admit. But if, by rubbing and wearing,

As it rarely happens that these are exactly agreeable to their standard,

G.ed.p65
OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF THE
PRICE OF COMMODITIES
96 [1] IN that early and rude state of society which precedes both the accumu-
lation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion between the
quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects seems to be
the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for
one another. If among a nation of hunters, for example, it usually costs
twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver
shouldnaturallyexchangefororbeworthtwodeer. Itisnaturalthatwhat
is usually the produce of two days’ or two hours’ labour, should be worth
doubleofwhatisusuallytheproduceofoneday’soronehour’slabour.
97 [2] Iftheonespeciesoflabourshouldbemoreseverethantheother,some
allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship; and the pro-
duceofonehour’slabourintheonewaymayfrequentlyexchangeforthat
oftwohours’labourintheother.
98 [3] Oriftheonespeciesoflabourrequiresanuncommondegreeofdexter-
ity and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents will natur-
ally give a value to their produce, superior to what would be due to the
time employed about it. Such talents can seldom be acquired but in con-
sequence of long application, and the superior value of their produce may
frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and
labour which must be spent in acquiring them. In the advanced state of
society, allowances of this kind, for superior hardship and superior skill,
are commonly made in the wages of labour; and something of the same
kindmustprobablyhavetakenplaceinitsearliestandrudestperiod.
99 [4] In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the la-
bourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or
producinganycommodityistheonlycircumstancewhichcanregulatethe
quantityexchangeforwhichitoughtcommonlytopurchase,command,or
exchangefor.
100 [5] As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons,
someofthemwillnaturallyemployitinsettingtoworkindustriouspeople,
whomtheywillsupplywithmaterialsandsubsistence,inordertomakea G.ed.p66
profitbythesaleoftheirwork,orbywhattheirlabouraddstothevalueof
the materials. In exchanging the complete manufacture either for money, TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
forlabour,orforothergoods,overandabovewhatmaybesufficienttopay
thepriceofthematerials,andthewagesoftheworkmen,somethingmust
begivenfortheprofitsoftheundertakeroftheworkwhohazardshisstock
in this adventure. The value which the workmen add to the materials,
therefore, resolvesitself inthis ease into two parts, ofwhichtheonepays
their wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock
of materials and wages which he advanced. He could have no interest to
employ them, unless he expected from the sale of their work something
more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to him; and he could
have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless
hisprofitsweretobearsomeproportiontotheextentofhisstock.
101 [6] The profits of stock, it may perhaps be thought are only a different
name for the wages of a particular sort of labour, the labour of inspec-
tion and direction. They are, however, altogether different, are regulated
by quite different principles, and bear no proportion to the quantity, the
hardship, or the ingenuity of this supposed labour of inspection and dir-
ection. They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock employed,
and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock. Let
ussuppose,forexample,thatinsomeparticularplace,wherethecommon
annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent, there are two dif-
ferent manufactures, in each of which twenty workmen are employed at
the rate of fifteen pounds a year each, or at the expense of three hundred
a year in each manufactory. Let us suppose, too, that the coarse materi-
alsannuallywroughtupintheonecostonlysevenhundredpounds,while
thefinermaterialsintheothercostseventhousand. Thecapitalannually
employedintheonewillinthiscaseamountonlytoonethousandpounds;
whereas that employed in the other will amount to seven thousand three
hundred pounds. At the rate of ten per cent, therefore, the undertaker of
theonewillexpectayearlyprofitofaboutonehundredpoundsonly;while
that of the other will expect about seven hundred and thirty pounds. But
though their profits are so very different, their labour of inspection and
directionmaybeeitheraltogetherorverynearlythesame. Inmanygreat
worksalmostthewholelabourofthiskindiscommittedtosomeprincipal
clerk. Hiswagesproperlyexpressthevalueofthislabourofinspectionand
direction. Thoughinsettlingthemsomeregardishadcommonly,notonly
to his labour and skill, but to the trust which is reposed in him, yet they
never bear any regular proportion to the capital of which he oversees the
management; and the owner of this capital, though he is thus discharged G.ed.p67
ofalmostalllabour,stillexpectsthathisprofitsshouldbeararegularpro-
portiontohiscapital. Inthepriceofcommodities,therefore,theprofitsof
stock constitute a component part altogether different from the wages of
labour,andregulatedbyquitedifferentprinciples.
102 [7] In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always
belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of
thestockwhichemployshim. Neitheristhequantityoflabourcommonly
42 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
employedinacquiringorproducinganycommodity,theonlycircumstance
which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase,
command, or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be
due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished
thematerialsofthatlabour.
103 [8] As soon as the land of any country has all become private property,
the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed,
and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest,
the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when
landwasincommon,costthelaboureronlythetroubleofgatheringthem,
come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must
then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord
a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or,
whatcomestothesamething,thepriceofthisportion,constitutestherent
of land, and in the price of the greater part of commodities makes a third
componentpart.
104 [9] The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be
observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of
them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that
part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves G.ed.p68
itselfintorent,andofthatwhichresolvesitselfintoprofit.
105 [10] Ineverysocietythepriceofeverycommodityfinallyresolvesitselfinto
someoneorother,orallofthosethreeparts;andineveryimprovedsociety,
all the three enter more or less, as component parts, into the price of the
fargreaterpartofcommodities.
106 [11] Inthepriceofcorn,forexample,onepartpaystherentofthelandlord,
another pays the wages or maintenance of the labourers and labouring
cattleemployedinproducingit,andthethirdpaystheprofitofthefarmer.
These three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the
wholepriceofcorn. Afourthpart,itmayperhapsbethought,isnecessary
for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the wear and
tear of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry. But it
mustbeconsideredthatthepriceofanyinstrumentofhusbandry,suchas

wagesofthislabour. Thoughthepriceofthecorn, therefore, maypaythe
priceaswellasthemaintenanceofthehorse,thewholepricestillresolves
itself either immediately or ultimately into the same three parts of rent,
labour,andprofit.
107 [12] In the price of flour or meal, we must add to the price of the corn, the
profits of the miller, and the wages of his servants; in the price of bread,
the profits of the baker, and the wages of his servants; and in the price of
both, the labour of transporting the corn from the house of the farmer to

withtheprofitsofthosewhoadvancethewagesofthatlabour.

Inthepriceoflinenwemustaddtothispricethewagesoftheflaxdresser,
ofthespinner,oftheweaver,ofthebleacher,etc.,togetherwiththeprofits
oftheirrespectiveemployers.
109 [14] As any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured, that
part of the price which resolves itself into wages and profit comes to be
greater in proportion to that which resolves itself into rent. In the pro-
gressofthemanufacture,notonlythenumberofprofitsincrease,butevery
subsequent profit is greater than the foregoing; because the capital from
whichitisderivedmustalwaysbegreater. Thecapitalwhichemploysthe
weavers, for example, must be greater than that which employs the spin-
ners; because it not only replaces that capital with its profits, but pays,
besides, the wages of the weavers; and the profits must always bear some
proportiontothecapital.
110 [15] In the most improved societies, however, there are always a few com- G.ed.p69
modities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only, the wages
of labour, and the profits of stock; and a still smaller number, in which it
consists altogether in the wages of labour. In the price of sea-fish, for ex-
ample,onepartpaysthelabourofthefishermen,andtheothertheprofits
of the capital employed in the fishery. Rent very seldom makes any part
of it, though it does sometimes, as I shall show hereafter. It is otherwise,
at least through the greater part of Europe, in river fisheries. A salmon
fishery pays a rent, and rent, though it cannot well be called the rent of
land,makesapartofthepriceofasalmonaswellaswagesandprofit. In

thesea-shore,thoselittlevariegatedstonescommonlyknownbythename
of Scotch Pebbles. The price which is paid to them by the stone-cutter is
altogetherthewagesoftheirlabour;neitherrentnorprofitmakeanypart
ofit.
[16] But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself
111
into some one or other, or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it
remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole la-
bouremployedinraising,manufacturing,andbringingittomarket,must
necessarilybeprofittosomebody.

of all revenue as well as of all exchangeable value. All other revenue is
ultimatelyderivedfromsomeoneorotherofthese.
113 [18] Whoeverderiveshisrevenuefromafundwhichishisown,mustdraw
it either from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue

117 [22] Anindependentmanufacturer,whohasstockenoughbothtopurchase
materials, and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to market,
should gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master,
and the profit which that master makes by the sale of the journeyman’s
work. His whole gains, however, are commonly called profit, and wages G.ed.p71
are,inthiscasetoo,confoundedwithprofit.
118 [23] A gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites
in his own person the three different characters of landlord, farmer, and
labourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first, the
profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The whole, however, is
commonly considered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit
are,inthiscase,confoundedwithwages.
119 [24] As in a civilised country there are but few commodities of which the
exchangeable value arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing

G.ed.p72
OF THE NATURAL AND MARKET PRICE
OF COMMODITIES
120 [1] THERE is in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or average rate
bothofwagesandprofitineverydifferentemploymentoflabourandstock.
This rate is naturally regulated, as I shall show hereafter, partly by the
general circumstances of the society, their riches or poverty, their advan-
cing,stationary,ordecliningcondition;andpartlybytheparticularnature
ofeachemployment.
[2] There is likewise in every society or neighbourhood an ordinary or av-
121
eragerateofrent,whichisregulatedtoo,asIshallshowhereafter,partly
bythegeneralcircumstancesofthesocietyorneighbourhoodinwhichthe
landissituated,andpartlybythenaturalorimprovedfertilityoftheland.
[3] These ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of
122
wages, profit, and rent, at the time and place in which they commonly
prevail.
123 [4] When the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what
is sufficient to pay the rent of the land, the wages of the labour, and the
profitsofthestockemployedinraising,preparing,andbringingittomar-
ket, according to their natural rates, the commodity is then sold for what
maybecalleditsnaturalprice.

the profit of the person who is to sell it again, yet if he sell it at a price
whichdoesnotallowhimtheordinaryrateofprofitinhisneighbourhood,
he is evidently a loser by the trade; since by employing his stock in some
other way he might have made that profit. His profit, besides, is his rev-
enue, the proper fund of his subsistence. As, while he is preparing and
bringingthegoodstomarket,headvancestohisworkmentheirwages,or

ably expect from the sale of his goods. Unless they yield him this profit,
therefore, they do not repay him what they may very properly be said to

there is perfect liberty, or where he may change his trade as often as he
pleases.
126 [7] Theactualpriceatwhichanycommodityiscommonlysoldiscalledits
marketprice. Itmayeitherbeabove,orbelow,orexactlythesamewithits

127 [8] Themarketpriceofeveryparticularcommodityisregulatedbythepro-
portionbetweenthequantitywhichisactuallybroughttomarket,andthe
demandofthosewhoarewillingtopaythenaturalpriceofthecommodity,

and their demand the effectual demand; since it may be sufficient to ef-
fectuate the bringing of the commodity to market. It is different from the
absolute demand. A very poor man may be said in some sense to have a
demandforacoachandsix;hemightliketohaveit;buthisdemandisnot
aneffectualdemand,asthecommoditycanneverbebroughttomarketin
ordertosatisfyit.
128 [9] When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls
short of the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the whole
value of the rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring
it thither, cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want. Rather
thanwantitaltogether,someofthemwillbewillingtogivemore. Acom-
petition will immediately begin among them, and the market price will
rise more or less above the natural price, according as either the great- G.ed.p74
nessofthedeficiency,orthewealthandwantonluxuryofthecompetitors,
happen to animate more or less the eagerness of the competition. Among
competitorsofequalwealthandluxurythesamedeficiencywillgenerally
occasion a more or less eager competition, according as the acquisition of
the commodity happens to be of more or less importance to them. Hence
theexorbitantpriceofthenecessariesoflifeduringtheblockadeofatown
orinafamine.
129 [10] Whenthequantitybroughttomarketexceedstheeffectualdemand,it
cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the
rent, wages, and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it thither.
Some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less, and the low
pricewhichtheygiveforitmustreducethepriceofthewhole. Themarket
pricewillsinkmoreorlessbelowthenaturalprice,accordingasthegreat-
ness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the sellers, or
according as it happens to be more or less important to them to get im-
mediately rid of the commodity. The same excess in the importation of
perishable, will occasion a much greater competition than in that of dur-
ablecommodities;intheimportationoforanges,forexample,thaninthat
ofoldiron.
48 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
130 [11] When the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the
effectual demand, and no more, the market price naturally comes to be
eitherexactly, orasnearlyascanbejudgedof, thesamewiththenatural
price. Thewholequantityuponhandcanbedisposedofforthisprice,and
cannot be disposed of for more. The competition of the different dealers
obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige them to accept
ofless.
131 [12] Thequantityofeverycommoditybroughttomarketnaturallysuitsit-
self to the effectual demand. It is the interest of all those who employ
theirland,labour,orstock,inbringinganycommoditytomarket,thatthe
quantity never should exceed the effectual demand; and it is the interest
ofallotherpeoplethatitnevershouldfallshortofthatdemand.
132 [13] If at any time it exceeds the effectual demand, some of the component
parts of its price must be paid below their natural rate. If it is rent, the
interestofthelandlordswillimmediatelypromptthemtowithdrawapart G.ed.p75
oftheirland;andifitiswagesorprofit,theinterestofthelabourersinthe
one case, and of their employers in the other, will prompt them to with-
draw a part of their labour or stock from this employment. The quantity
broughttomarketwillsoonbenomorethansufficienttosupplytheeffec-
tual demand. All the different parts of its price will rise to their natural
rate,andthewholepricetoitsnaturalprice.
133 [14] If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any time
fallshortoftheeffectualdemand,someofthecomponentpartsofitsprice
must rise above their natural rate. If it is rent, the interest of all other
landlordswillnaturallypromptthemtopreparemorelandfortheraising
ofthiscommodity;ifitiswagesorprofit,theinterestofallotherlabourers
and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labour and stock in
preparing and bringing it to market. The quantity brought thither will
soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. All the different parts
of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the whole price to its
naturalprice.
134 [15] The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which
the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating. Different ac-
cidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it, and
sometimes force them down even somewhat below it. But whatever may
be the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this centre of repose
andcontinuance,theyareconstantlytendingtowardsit.
135 [16] Thewholequantityofindustryannuallyemployedinordertobringany
commoditytomarketnaturallysuitsitselfinthismannertotheeffectual
demand. Itnaturallyaimsatbringingalwaysthatprecisequantitythither
whichmaybesufficienttosupply,andnomorethansupply,thatdemand.
136 [17] But in some employments the same quantity of industry will in differ-
ent years produce very different quantities of commodities; while in oth-
ers it will produce always the same, or very nearly the same. The same
number of labourers in husbandry will, in different years, produce very
49 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
different quantities of corn, wine, oil, hops, etc. But the same number of
spinnersandweaverswilleveryyearproducethesameorverynearlythe
same quantity of linen and woollen cloth. It is only the average produce
oftheonespeciesofindustrywhichcanbesuitedinanyrespecttotheef-
fectual demand; and as its actual produce is frequently much greater and
frequently much less than its average produce, the quantity of the com-
moditiesbroughttomarketwillsometimesexceedagooddeal, andsome-
times fall short a good deal, of the effectual demand. Even though that
demand therefore should continue always the same, their market price G.ed.p76
will be liable to great fluctuations, will sometimes fall a good deal below,
and sometimes rise a good deal above their natural price. In the other
speciesofindustry,theproduceofequalquantitiesoflabourbeingalways
the same, or very nearly the same, it can be more exactly suited to the
effectual demand. While that demand continues the same, therefore, the
market price of the commodities is likely to do so too, and to be either al-
together,orasnearlyascanbejudgedof,thesamewiththenaturalprice.
That the price of linen and woolen cloth is liable neither to such frequent
nor to such great variations as the price of corn, every man’s experience
will inform him. The price of the one species of commodities varies only
with the variations in the demand: that of the other varies, not only with
the variations in the demand, but with the much greater and more fre-
quent variations in the quantity of what is brought to market in order to
supplythatdemand.
137 [18] The occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any
commodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve them-
selves into wages and profit. That part which resolves itself into rent is
less affected by them. A rent certain in money is not in the least affected
by them either in its rate or in its value. A rent which consists either
in a certain proportion or in a certain quantity of the rude produce, is no
doubtaffectedinitsyearlyvaluebyalltheoccasionalandtemporaryfluc-
tuationsinthemarketpriceofthatrudeproduce;butitisseldomaffected
by them in its yearly rate. In settling the terms of the lease, the landlord
and farmer endeavour, according to their best judgment, to adjust that
rate,nottothetemporaryandoccasional,buttotheaverageandordinary
priceoftheproduce.
138 [19] Such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate either of wages
or of profit, according as the market happens to be either overstocked or
understocked with commodities or with labour; with work done, or with
work to be done. A public mourning raises the price of black cloth (with
which the market is almost always understocked upon such occasions),
and augments the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable
quantityofit. Ithasnoeffectuponthewagesoftheweavers. Themarketis
understockedwithcommodities,notwithlabour;withworkdone,notwith
work to be done. It raises the wages of journeymen tailors. The market
is here understocked with labour. There is an effectual demand for more
50 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
labour, for more work to be done than can be had. It sinks the price of
colouredsilksandcloths,andtherebyreducestheprofitsofthemerchants
who have any considerable quantity of them upon hand. It sinks, too, the G.ed.p77
wagesoftheworkmenemployedinpreparingsuchcommodities,forwhich
all demand is stopped for six months, perhaps for a twelvemonth. The
marketishereover-stockedbothwithcommoditiesandwithlabour.
139 [20] But though the market price of every particular commodity is in this
manner continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards the natural
price, yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes natural causes, and
sometimes particular regulations of police, may, in many commodities,
keep up the market price, for a long time together, a good deal above the
naturalprice.
140 [21] Whenbyanincreaseintheeffectualdemand,themarketpriceofsome
particularcommodityhappenstoriseagooddealabovethenaturalprice,
thosewhoemploytheirstocksinsupplyingthatmarketaregenerallycare-
ful to conceal this change. If it was commonly known, their great profit
would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same way
that, the effectual demand being fully supplied, the market price would
soon be reduced to the natural price, and perhaps for some time even be-
low it. If the market is at a great distance from the residence of those
who supply it, they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for several
years together, and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits without
any new rivals. Secrets of this kind, however, it must be acknowledged,
can seldom be long kept; and the extraordinary profit can last very little
longerthantheyarekept.
[22] Secrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets
141
in trade. A dyer who has found the means of producing a particular col-
ourwithmaterialswhichcostonlyhalfthepriceofthosecommonlymade
use of, may, with good management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery
as long as he lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity. His ex-
traordinary gains arise from the high price which is paid for his private
labour. They properly consist in the high wages of that labour. But as
theyarerepeateduponeverypartofhisstock,andastheirwholeamount

consideredasextraordinaryprofitsofstock.

142
ticularaccidents,ofwhich,however,theoperationmaysometimeslastfor
manyyearstogether.
143 [24] Some natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situ-
ation that all the land in a great country, which is fit for producing them,
may not be sufficient to supply the effectual demand. The whole quantity
brought to market, therefore, may be disposed of to those who are willing
togivemorethanwhatissufficienttopaytherentofthelandwhichpro-
duced them, together with the wages of the labour, and the profits of the

centuriestogethertobesoldatthishighprice;andthatpartofitwhichre-

rent of other equally fertile and equally well-cultivated land in its neigh-
bourhood. The wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed
inbringingsuchcommoditiestomarket,onthecontrary,areseldomoutof
their natural proportion to those of the other employments of labour and
stockintheirneighbourhood.
[25] Suchenhancementsofthemarketpriceareevidentlytheeffectofnat-

ural causes which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully
supplied,andwhichmaycontinue,therefore,tooperateforever.
145 [26] A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company
has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopol-
ists, by keeping the market constantly understocked, by never fully sup-
plying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the nat-
ural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or
profit,greatlyabovetheirnaturalrate.
146 [27] Thepriceofmonopolyisuponeveryoccasionthehighestwhichcanbe

is the lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion, indeed, but for
anyconsiderabletimetogether. Theoneisuponeveryoccasionthehighest G.ed.p79

147 [28] Theexclusiveprivilegesofcorporations,statutesofapprenticeship,and
allthoselawswhichrestrain, inparticularemployments, thecompetition
to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same
tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopol-
ies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of em-
ployments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the
naturalprice,andmaintainboththewagesofthelabourandtheprofitsof

149 [30] Themarketpriceofanyparticularcommodity,thoughitmaycontinue

150 [31] The same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws in-
deed, which, when a manufacture is in prosperity, enable the workman
to raise his wages a good deal above their natural rate, sometimes oblige
him, when it decays, to let them down a good deal below it. As in the
one case they exclude many people from his employment, so in the other
theyexcludehimfrommanyemployments. Theeffectofsuchregulations,
however, is not near so durable in sinking the workman’s wages below, as
in raising them above their natural rate. Their operation in the one way
mayendureformanycenturies,butintheotheritcanlastnolongerthan
the lives of some of the workmen who were bred to the business in the
time of its prosperity. When they are gone, the number of those who are
afterwards educated to the trade will naturally suit itself to the effectual G.ed.p80
demand. ThepolicemustbeasviolentasthatofIndostanorancientEgypt

G.ed.p82
OF THE WAGES OF LABOUR
157 [1] THE produce of labour constitutes the natural recompense or wages of la-
bour.
158 [2] In that original state of things, which precedes both the appropriation
oflandandtheaccumulationofstock,thewholeproduceoflabourbelongs
tothelabourer. Hehasneitherlandlordnormastertosharewithhim.
159 [3] Had this state continued, the wages of labour would have augmented
withallthoseimprovementsinitsproductivepowerstowhichthedivision
oflabourgivesoccasion. Allthingswouldgraduallyhavebecomecheaper.
They would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labour; and as
the commodities produced by equal quantities of labour would naturally
inthisstateofthingsbeexchangedforoneanother,theywouldhavebeen
purchasedlikewisewiththeproduceofasmallerquantity.
160 [4] Butthoughallthingswouldhavebecomecheaperinreality,inappear-
ance many things might have become dearer than before, or have been
exchanged for a greater quantity of other goods. Let us suppose, for ex-
ample, that in the greater part of employments the productive powers of
labourhadbeenimprovedtotenfold,orthataday’slabourcouldproduce
ten times the quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in
a particular employment they had been improved, only to double, or that
a day’s labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had
done before. In exchanging the produce of a day’s labour in the greater
part of employments for that of a day’s labour in this particular one, ten
timestheoriginalquantityofworkinthemwouldpurchaseonlytwicethe
original quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound
weight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In
reality,however,itwouldbetwiceascheap. Thoughitrequiredfivetimes
the quantity of other goods to purchase it, it would require only half the
quantity of labour either to purchase or to produce it. The acquisition,
therefore,wouldbetwiceaseasyasbefore.
161 [5] But this original state of things, in which the labourer enjoyed the
whole produce of his own labour, could not last beyond the first introduc-
tion of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock. It was at
an end, therefore, long before the most considerable improvements were
made in the productive powers of labour, and it would be to no purpose TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompense or G.ed.p83
wagesoflabour.
162 [6] As soon as land becomes private property, the landlord demands a
share of almost all the produce which the labourer can either raise, or
collectfromit. Hisrentmakesthefirstdeductionfromtheproduceofthe
labourwhichisemployeduponland.
163 [7] It seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has where-
withal to maintain himself till he reaps the harvest. His maintenance
is generally advanced to him from the stock of a master, the farmer who
employs him, and who would have no interest to employ him, unless he
was to share in the produce of his labour, or unless his stock was to be
replaced to him with a profit. This profit, makes a second deduction from
theproduceofthelabourwhichisemployeduponland.

166 [10] Suchcases,however,arenotveryfrequent,andineverypartofEurope,
twentyworkmenserveunderamasterforonethatisindependent;andthe
wages of labour are everywhere understood to be, what they usually are,
whenthelabourerisoneperson,andtheownerofthestockwhichemploys
himanother.
167 [11] What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the
contract usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by
no means the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to
give as little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to
raise,thelatterinordertolowerthewagesoflabour.
168 [12] It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must,
upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force
theotherintoacompliancewiththeirterms. Themasters,beingfewerin
number, can combine much more easily; and the law, besides, authorizes, G.ed.p84
oratleastdoesnotprohibittheircombinations,whileitprohibitsthoseof
the workmen. We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower
the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such
disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a
master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single
56 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they
havealreadyacquired. Manyworkmencouldnotsubsistaweek,fewcould
subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long
run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to
him;butthenecessityisnotsoimmediate.
169 [13] Werarelyhear,ithasbeensaid,ofthecombinationsofmasters,though
frequentlyofthoseofworkmen. Butwhoeverimagines,uponthisaccount,
that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject.
Mastersarealwaysandeverywhereinasortoftacit,butconstantanduni-
formcombination,nottoraisethewagesoflabourabovetheiractualrate.
To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and
a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We sel-
dom,indeed,hearofthiscombination,becauseitistheusual,andonemay
say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too,
sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour
evenbelowthisrate. Thesearealwaysconductedwiththeutmostsilence
andsecrecy,tillthemomentofexecution,andwhentheworkmenyield,as
theysometimesdo,withoutresistance,thoughseverelyfeltbythem,they
are never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are fre-
quentlyresistedbyacontrarydefensivecombinationoftheworkmen;who
sometimestoo,withoutanyprovocationofthiskind,combineoftheirown
accord to raise the price of their labour. Their usual pretences are, some-
times the high price of provisions; sometimes the great profit which their
mastersmakebytheirwork. Butwhethertheircombinationsbeoffensive
or defensive, they are always abundantly heard of. In order to bring the
pointtoaspeedydecision, theyhavealwaysrecoursetotheloudestclam-
our, and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage. They are G.ed.p85

sity superior steadiness of the masters, partly from the necessity which
the greater part of the workmen are under of submitting for the sake of
presentsubsistence,generallyendinnothing,butthepunishmentorruin
oftheringleaders.
170 [14] But though in disputes with their workmen, masters must generally
havetheadvantage,thereis,however,acertainratebelowwhichitseems
impossible to reduce, for any considerable time, the ordinary wages even
ofthelowestspeciesoflabour.
171 [15] A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be
57 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
sufficienttomaintainhim. Theymustevenuponmostoccasionsbesome-
what more; otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family,
and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation.
Mr. Cantillon seems, upon this account, to suppose that the lowest spe-
ciesofcommonlabourersmusteverywhereearnatleastdoubletheirown
maintenance,inorderthatonewithanothertheymaybeenabledtobring
uptwochildren;thelabourofthewife,onaccountofhernecessaryattend-
anceonthechildren,beingsupposednomorethansufficienttoprovidefor
herself. But one half the children born, it is computed, die before the age
of manhood. The poorest labourers, therefore, according to this account,
must, one with another, attempt to rear at least four children, in order
thattwomayhaveanequalchanceoflivingtothatage. Butthenecessary
maintenance of four children, it is supposed, may be nearly equal to that
of one man. The labour of an able-bodied slave, the same author adds, is
computed to be worth double his maintenance; and that of the meanest
labourer,hethinks,cannotbeworthlessthanthatofanablebodiedslave.
Thus far at least seems certain, that, in order to bring up a family, the
labour of the husband and wife together must, even in the lowest species
of common labour, be able to earn something more than what is precisely
necessary for their own maintenance; but in what proportion, whether in G.ed.p86
thatabovementioned,orinanyother,Ishallnottakeuponmetodeterm-
ine.
172 [16] There are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the
labourers an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages consider-
ablyabovethisrate;evidentlythelowestwhichisconsistentwithcommon
humanity.
173 [17] When in any country the demand for those who live by wages, labour-
ers, journeymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when

174 [18] Thedemandforthosewholivebywages, itisevident, cannotincrease
but in proportion to the increase of the funds which are destined for the
payment of wages. These funds are of two kinds; first, revenue which is
over and above what is necessary for the maintenance; and, secondly, the
stock which is over and above what is necessary for the employment of
theirmasters.
175 [19] When the landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue
than what he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs
eitherthewholeorapartofthesurplusinmaintainingoneormoremenial
servants. Increasethissurplus,andhewillnaturallyincreasethenumber

58 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
176 [20] When an independent workman, such as a weaver or shoemaker, has
got more stock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of his
own work, and to maintain himself till he can dispose of it, he naturally
employs one or more journeymen with the surplus, in order to make a
profit by their work. Increase this surplus, and he will naturally increase
thenumberofhisjourneymen.
177 [21] The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, necessarily in-
creases with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and
cannot possibly increase without it. The increase of revenue and stock is G.ed.p87
the increase of national wealth. The demand for those who live by wages,
therefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and
cannotpossiblyincreasewithoutit.
178 [22] It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual in-
crease,whichoccasionsariseinthewagesoflabour. Itisnot,accordingly,
in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are
growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest. England
is certainly, in the present times, a much richer country than any part of
North America. The wages of labour, however, are much higher in North
America than in any part of England. In the province of New York, com-
mon labourers earn three shillings and sixpence currency, equal to two
shillings sterling, a day; ship carpenters, ten shillings and sixpence cur-
rency, with a pint of rum worth sixpence sterling, equal in all to six shil-
lings and sixpence sterling; house carpenters and bricklayers, eight shil-
lings currency, equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling; journeymen
tailors, five shillings currency, equal to about two shillings and tenpence
sterling. These prices are all above the London price; and wages are said
tobeashighintheothercoloniesasinNewYork. Thepriceofprovisions
is everywhere in North America much lower than in England. A dearth
hasneverbeenknownthere. Intheworstseasonstheyhavealwayshada
sufficiency for themselves, though less for exportation. If the money price
of labour, therefore, be higher than it is anywhere in the mother country,
itsrealprice,therealcommandofthenecessariesandconvenienciesoflife
which it conveys to the labourer must be higher in a still greater propor-
tion.
179 [23] But though North America is not yet so rich as England, it is much
more thriving, and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further
acquisitionofriches. Themostdecisivemarkoftheprosperityofanycoun-
tryis theincreaseof thenumber of itsinhabitants. In GreatBritain, and G.ed.p88
most other European countries, they are not supposed to double in less
than five hundred years. In the British colonies in North America, it has
been found that they double in twenty or five-and-twenty years. Nor in
the present times is this increase principally owing to the continual im-
portationofnewinhabitants,buttothegreatmultiplicationofthespecies.
Those who live to old age, it is said, frequently see there from fifty to a
hundred, and sometimes many more, descendants from their own body.
59 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Labour is there so well rewarded that a numerous family of children, in-
stead of being a burthen, is a source of opulence and prosperity to the
parents. The labour of each child, before it can leave their house, is com-
puted to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them. A young widow
withfourorfiveyoungchildren,who,amongthemiddlingorinferiorranks
of people in Europe, would have so little chance for a second husband, is
there frequently courted as a sort of fortune. The value of children is the
greatestofallencouragementstomarriage. Wecannot,therefore,wonder
thatthepeopleinNorthAmericashouldgenerallymarryveryyoung. Not-
withstandingthegreatincreaseoccasionedbysuchearlymarriages,there
is a continual complaint of the scarcity of hands in North America. The
demand for labourers, the funds destined for maintaining them, increase,
itseems,stillfasterthantheycanfindlabourerstoemploy.
180 [24] Thoughthewealthofacountryshouldbeverygreat,yetifithasbeen G.ed.p89
longstationary,wemustnotexpecttofindthewagesoflabourveryhighin
it. Thefundsdestinedforthepaymentofwages, therevenueandstockof
its inhabitants, may be of the greatest extent; but if they have continued
for several centuries of the same, or very nearly of the same extent, the
number of labourers employed every year could easily supply, and even
more than supply, the number wanted the following year. There could
seldom be any scarcity of hands, nor could the masters be obliged to bid
against one another in order to get them. The hands, on the contrary,
would, in this case, naturally multiply beyond their employment. There
would be a constant scarcity of employment, and the labourers would be
obliged to bid against one another in order to get it. If in such a coun-
try the wages of labour had ever been more than sufficient to maintain
the labourer, and to enable him to bring up a family, the competition of
the labourers and the interest of the masters would soon reduce them to
this lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity. China has
beenlongoneoftherichest,thatis,oneofthemostfertile,bestcultivated,
most industrious, and most populous countries in world. It seems, how-
ever, to have been long stationary. Marco Polo, who visited it more than
five hundred years ago, describes its cultivation, industry, and populous-
ness, almost in the same terms in which they are described by travellers
in the present times. It had perhaps, even long before his time, acquired
that full complement of riches which the nature of its laws and institu-
tions permits it to acquire. The accounts of all travellers, inconsistent in
manyotherrespects,agreeinthelowwagesoflabour,andinthedifficulty
whicha labourerfinds inbringing upa family inChina. Ifby diggingthe

stillworse. Insteadofwaitingindolentlyintheirworkhouses,forthecalls
of their customers, as in Europe, they are continually running about the
streetswiththetoolsoftheirrespectivetrades,offeringtheirservice,and
as it were begging employment. The poverty of the lower ranks of people
60 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
in China far surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe. In
the neighbourhood of Canton many hundred, it is commonly said, many
thousand families have no habitation on the land, but live constantly in
littlefishingboatsupontheriversandcanals. Thesubsistencewhichthey
find there is so scanty that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage
thrown overboard from any European ship. Any carrion, the carcase of a G.ed.p90
dead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and stinking, is as wel-
cometothemasthemostwholesomefoodtothepeopleofothercountries.
MarriageisencouragedinChina,notbytheprofitablenessofchildren,but
bythelibertyofdestroyingthem. Inallgreattownsseveralareeverynight
exposed in the street, or drowned like puppies in the water. The perform-
ance of this horrid office is even said to be the avowed business by which
somepeopleearntheirsubsistence.
181 [25] China, however, though it may perhaps stand still, does not seem to
go backwards. Its towns are nowhere deserted by their inhabitants. The
lands which had once been cultivated are nowhere neglected. The same
or very nearly the same annual labour must therefore continue to be per-
formed,andthefundsdestinedformaintainingitmustnot,consequently,
be sensibly diminished. The lowest class of labourers, therefore, notwith-
standing their scanty subsistence, must some way or another make shift
tocontinuetheirracesofarastokeepuptheirusualnumbers.
182 [26] Butitwouldbeotherwiseinacountrywherethefundsdestinedforthe

stocked with its own workmen, but with the overflowings of all the other

duce the wages of labour to the most miserable and scanty subsistence of
thelabourer. Manywouldnotbeabletofindemploymentevenuponthese

eitherbybegging, orbytheperpetrationperhapsofthegreatestenormit-

andfromthenceextendthemselvestoallthesuperiorclasses,tillthenum-
berofinhabitantsinthecountrywasreducedtowhatcouldeasilybemain-
tained by the revenue and stock which remained in it, and which had es-
caped either the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest. This
perhaps is nearly the present state of Bengal, and of some other of the
EnglishsettlementsintheEastIndies. Inafertilecountrywhichhadbe-
fore been much depopulated, where subsistence, consequently, should not
beverydifficult,andwhere,notwithstanding,threeorfourhundredthou-
sand people die of hunger in one year, we may be assured that the funds
destinedforthemaintenanceofthelabouringpoorarefastdecaying. The
difference between the genius of the British constitution which protects
61 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
and governs North America, and that of the mercantile company which
oppresses and domineers in the East Indies, cannot perhaps be better il-
lustratedthanbythedifferentstateofthosecountries.
183 [27] The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the necessary effect, so
itisthenaturalsymptomofincreasingnationalwealth. Thescantymain-
tenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom
thatthingsareatastand,andtheirstarvingconditionthattheyaregoing
fastbackwards.
184 [28] In Great Britain the wages of labour seem, in the present times, to be
evidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to
bringupafamily. Inordertosatisfyourselvesuponthispointitwillnotbe
necessarytoenterintoanytediousordoubtfulcalculationofwhatmaybe
the lowestsum upon which it is possible to do this. There are many plain
symptomsthatthewagesoflabourarenowhereinthiscountryregulated
bythislowestratewhichisconsistentwithcommonhumanity.
185 [29] First, inalmosteverypartofGreatBritainthereisadistinction, even
in the lowest species of labour, between summer and winter wages. Sum-
mer wages are always highest. But on account of the extraordinary ex-
pense of fuel, the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter.
Wages,therefore,beinghighestwhenthisexpenseislowest,itseemsevid-
ent that they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expense; but
by the quantity and supposed value of the work. A labourer, it may be
saidindeed,oughttosavepartofhissummerwagesinordertodefrayhis
winterexpense;andthatthroughthewholeyeartheydonotexceedwhat G.ed.p92
isnecessarytomaintainhisfamilythroughthewholeyear. Aslave, how-
ever, or one absolutely dependent on us for immediate subsistence, would
notbetreatedinthismanner. Hisdailysubsistencewouldbeproportioned
tohisdailynecessities.
186 [30] Secondly,thewagesoflabourdonotinGreatBritainfluctuatewiththe
price of provisions. These vary everywhere from year to year, frequently
from month to month. But in many places the money price of labour re-
mains uniformly the same sometimes for half a century together. If in
these places, therefore, the labouring poor can maintain their families in
dear years, they mustbe at their ease intimes of moderate plenty, andin
affluenceinthoseofextraordinarycheapness. Thehighpriceofprovisions
during these ten years past has not in many parts of the kingdom been
accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of labour. It has,
indeed, in some, owing probably more to the increase of the demand for
labourthantothatofthepriceofprovisions.
187 [31] Thirdly, as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than
the wages of labour, so, on the other hand, the wages of labour vary more
from place to place than the price of provisions. The prices of bread and
butcher’smeataregenerallythesameorverynearlythesamethroughthe
greater part of the United Kingdom. These and most other things which
are sold by retail, the way in which the labouring poor buy all things, are
62 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
generally fully as cheap or cheaper in great towns than in the remoter
parts of the country, for reasons which I shall have occasion to explain
hereafter. But the wages of labour in a great town and its neighbour-
hoodarefrequentlyafourthorafifthpart, twentyorfive-and-twentyper
cent higher than at a few miles distance. Eighteenpence a day may be
reckonedthecommonpriceoflabourinLondonanditsneighbourhood. At
afewmilesdistanceitfallstofourteenandfifteenpence. Tenpencemaybe

tance it falls to eightpence, the usual price of common labour through the
greaterpartofthelowcountryofScotland,whereitvariesagooddealless
thaninEngland. Suchadifferenceofprices,whichitseemsisnotalways
sufficient to transport a man from one parish to another, would necessar-
ily occasion so great a transportation of the most bulky commodities, not
only from one parish to another, but from one end of the kingdom, almost
from one end of the world to the other, as would soon reduce them more
nearlytoalevel. Afterallthathasbeensaidofthelevityandinconstancy G.ed.p93

therefore,canmaintaintheirfamiliesinthosepartsofthekingdomwhere

188 [32] Fourthly,thevariationsinthepriceoflabournotonlydonotcorrespond
either in place or time with those in the price of provisions, but they are
frequentlyquiteopposite.
189 [33] Grain, the food of the common people, is dearer in Scotland than in
England,whenceScotlandreceivesalmosteveryyearverylargesupplies.
But English corn must be sold dearer in Scotland, the country to which it
isbrought, thaninEngland, thecountryfromwhichitcomes; andinpro-
portion to its quality it cannot be sold dearer in Scotland than the Scotch
cornthatcomestothesamemarketincompetitionwithit. Thequalityof

land. This difference, however, in the mode of their subsistence is not the
cause, buttheeffectofthedifferenceintheirwages; though, byastrange
misapprehension, I have frequently heard it represented as the cause. It

190 [34] During the course of the last century, taking one year with another,
grainwasdearerinbothpartsoftheUnitedKingdomthanduringthatof
thepresent. Thisisamatteroffactwhichcannotnowadmitofanyreason-
abledoubt;andtheproofofitis,ifpossible,stillmoredecisivewithregard
to Scotland than with regard to England. It is in Scotland supported by
the evidence of the public fiars, annual valuations made upon oath, ac- G.ed.p94
cordingtotheactualstateofthemarkets,ofallthedifferentsortsofgrain
in every different county of Scotland. If such direct proof could require
any collateral evidence to confirm it, I would observe that this has like-
wisebeenthecaseinFrance,andprobablyinmostotherpartsofEurope.
With regard to France there is the clearest proof. But though it is certain
that in both parts of the United Kingdom grain was somewhat dearer in
the last century than in the present, it is equally certain that labour was
muchcheaper. Ifthelabouringpoor,therefore,couldbringuptheirfamil-
iesthen,theymustbemuchmoreattheireasenow. Inthelastcentury,the
mostusualday-wagesofcommonlabourthroughthegreaterpartofScot-
land were sixpence in summer and fivepence in winter. Three shillings a
week, the same price very nearly, still continues to be paid in some parts
of the Highlands and Western Islands. Through the greater part of the
low country the most usual wages of common labour are now eightpence
a day; tenpence, sometimes a shilling about Edinburgh, in the counties
which border upon England, probably on account of that neighbourhood,
and in a few other places where there has lately been a considerable rise
in the demand for labour, about Glasgow, Carron, Ayrshire, etc. In Eng-
landtheimprovementsofagriculture,manufactures,andcommercebegan
much earlier than in Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently
its price, must necessarily have increased with those improvements. In
thelastcentury,accordingly,aswellasinthepresent,thewagesoflabour
were higher in England than in Scotland. They have risen, too, consider-
ably since that time, though, on account of the greater variety of wages

to do something, and two not able, at ten shillings a week, or twenty-six

to a family, which he supposed to consist, one with another, of three and
ahalfpersons. Hiscalculation,therefore,thoughdifferentinappearance,
corresponds very nearly at bottom with that of Judge Hales. Both sup-
posetheweeklyexpenseofsuchfamiliestobeabouttwentypenceahead.
Both the pecuniary income and expense of such families have increased
considerably since that time through the greater part of the kingdom; in
some places more, and in some less; though perhaps scarce anywhere so
much as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of labour have
lately represented them to the public. The price of labour, it must be ob-
served, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices
being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not
only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to
the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated
by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual;
and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly,
thoughithasoftenpretendedtodoso.
191 [35] Therealrecompenseoflabour,therealquantityofthenecessariesand
conveniences of life which it can procure to the labourer, has, during the
course of the present century, increased perhaps in a still greater propor-
tion than its money price. Not only grain has become somewhat cheaper,
butmanyotherthingsfromwhichtheindustriouspoorderiveanagreeable
andwholesomevarietyoffoodhavebecomeagreatdealcheaper. Potatoes,
for example, do not at present, through the greater part of the kingdom,
costhalfthepricewhichtheyusedtodothirtyorfortyyearsago. Thesame
thingmaybesaidofturnips,carrots,cabbages;thingswhichwereformerly G.ed.p96
neverraisedbutbythespade,butwhicharenowcommonlyraisedbythe
plough. Allsortofgardenstuff,too,hasbecomecheaper. Thegreaterpart
of the apples and even of the onions consumed in Great Britain were in
the last century imported from Flanders. The great improvements in the
coarser manufactures of both linen and woollen cloth furnish the labour-
erswithcheaperandbetterclothing;andthoseinthemanufacturesofthe
coarser metals, with cheaper and better instruments of trade, as well as
with many agreeable and convenient pieces of household furniture. Soap,
salt, candles, leather, and fermented liquors have, indeed, become a good
deal dearer; chiefly from the taxes which have been laid upon them. The
quantityofthese,however,whichthelabouringpoorareunderanyneces-
sityofconsuming,issoverysmall,thattheincreaseintheirpricedoesnot
compensate the diminution in that of so many other things. The common
complaintthatluxuryextendsitselfeventothelowestranksofthepeople,
andthatthelabouringpoorwillnotnowbecontentedwiththesamefood,
clothing, and lodging which satisfied them in former times, may convince
us that it is not the money price of labour only, but its real recompense,
whichhasaugmented.
192 [36] Is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the
people to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to the so-
65 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ciety? Theanswerseemsatfirstsightabundantlyplain. Servants,labour-
ers,andworkmenofdifferentkinds,makeupthefargreaterpartofevery
greatpoliticalsociety. Butwhatimprovesthecircumstancesofthegreater
part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society
can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the
members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who
feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a
shareoftheproduceoftheirownlabourastobethemselvestolerablywell
fed,clothed,andlodged.
193 [37] Poverty, though it no doubt discourages, does not always prevent mar-
riage. It seems even to be favourable to generation. A half-starved
Highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children, while a
pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any, and is generally
exhausted by two or three. Barrenness, so frequent among women of G.ed.p97
fashion, is very rare among those of inferior station. Luxury in the fair
sex,whileitinflamesperhapsthepassionforenjoyment,seemsalwaysto
weaken,andfrequentlytodestroyaltogether,thepowersofgeneration.
194 [38] But poverty, though it does not prevent the generation, is extremely
unfavourabletotherearingofchildren. Thetenderplantisproduced,but
in so cold a soil and so severe a climate, soon withers and dies. It is not
uncommon, I have been frequently told, in the Highlands of Scotland for
a mother who has borne twenty children not to have two alive. Several
officers of great experience have assured me, that so far from recruiting
their regiment, they have never been able to supply it with drums and
fifesfromallthesoldiers’childrenthatwereborninit. Agreaternumber
offinechildren,however,isseldomseenanywherethanaboutabarrackof
soldiers. Very few of them, it seems, arrive at the age of thirteen or four-
teen. In some places one half the children born die before they are four
yearsofage;inmanyplacesbeforetheyareseven;andinalmostallplaces
beforetheyarenineorten. Thisgreatmortality,however,willeverywhere
befoundchieflyamongthechildrenofthecommonpeople,whocannotaf-
ford to tend them with the same care as those of better station. Though
their marriages are generally more fruitful than those of people of fash-
ion,asmallerproportionoftheirchildrenarriveatmaturity. Infoundling
hospitals,andamongthechildrenbroughtupbyparishcharities,themor-
talityisstillgreaterthanamongthoseofthecommonpeople.
195 [39] Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the
means of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply beyond it.
But in civilised society it is only among the inferior ranks of people that
thescantinessofsubsistencecansetlimitstothefurthermultiplicationof
the human species; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a G.ed.p98
greatpartofthechildrenwhichtheirfruitfulmarriagesproduce.
196 [40] The liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for
their children, and consequently to bring up a greater number, naturally
tends to widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too,
66 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
that it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which
the demand for labour requires. If this demand is continually increasing,
the reward of labour must necessarily encourage in such a manner the
marriage and multiplication of labourers, as may enable them to supply
that continually increasing demand by a continually increasing popula-
tion. Iftherewardshouldatanytimebelessthanwhatwasrequisitefor
thispurpose,thedeficiencyofhandswouldsoonraiseit;andifitshouldat
anytimebemore,theirexcessivemultiplicationwouldsoonlowerittothis
necessary rate. The market would be so much understocked with labour
intheonecase,andsomuchoverstockedintheother,aswouldsoonforce
back its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society
required. It is in this manner that the demand for men, like that for any
othercommodity, necessarilyregulatestheproductionofmen; quickensit
whenitgoesontooslowly,andstopsitwhenitadvancestoofast. Itisthis
demand which regulates and determines the state of propagation in all
the different countries of the world, in North America, in Europe, and in
China; which renders it rapidly progressive in the first, slow and gradual
inthesecond,andaltogetherstationaryinthelast.
197 [41] The wear and tear of a slave, it has been said, is at the expense of his
master; but that of a free servant is at his own expense. The wear and
tearofthelatter,however,is,inreality,asmuchattheexpenseofhismas-
ter as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of
every kind must be such as may enable them, one with another, to con-
tinue the race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing,
diminishing, or stationary demand of the society may happen to require.
But though the wear and tear of a free servant be equally at the expense
of his master, it generally costs him much less than that of a slave. The
funddestinedforreplacingorrepairing,ifImaysayso,thewearandtear
oftheslave,iscommonlymanagedbyanegligentmasterorcarelessover-
seer. That destined for performing the same office with regard to the free
man, is managed by the free man himself. The disorders which generally
prevail in the economy of the rich, naturally introduce themselves into
the management of the former: The strict frugality and parsimonious at-
tention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the latter.
Under such different management, the same purpose must require very
differentdegreesofexpensetoexecuteit. Itappears,accordingly,fromthe G.ed.p99
experience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done by free-
men comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves. It is found
to do so even at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, where the wages of
commonlabouraresoveryhigh.
198 [42] The liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing
wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it is to
lament over the necessary effect and cause of the greatest public prosper-
ity.

200 [44] The liberal reward of labour, as it encourages the propagation, so it
increases the industry of the common people. The wages of labour are
theencouragementofindustry,which,likeeveryotherhumanquality,im-
proves in proportion to the encouragement it receives. A plentiful sub-
sistenceincreasesthebodilystrengthofthelabourer,andthecomfortable
hopeofbetteringhiscondition,andofendinghisdaysperhapsineaseand
plenty, animates him to exert that strength to the utmost. Where wages
are high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, dili-
gent, and expeditious than where they are low: in England, for example,
thaninScotland;intheneighbourhoodofgreattownsthaninremotecoun-
tryplaces. Someworkmen,indeed, whentheycanearninfourdayswhat
will maintain them through the week, will be idle the other three. This,
however, is by no means the case with the greater part. Workmen, on the G.ed.p100
contrary, when they are liberally paid by the piece, are very apt to over-
workthemselves,andtoruintheirhealthandconstitutioninafewyears.
A carpenter in London, and in some other places, is not supposed to last
in his utmost vigour above eight years. Something of the same kind hap-
pensinmanyothertrades,inwhichtheworkmenarepaidbythepiece,as
theygenerallyareinmanufactures,andevenincountrylabour,wherever
wages are higher than ordinary. Almost every class of artificers is sub-
jecttosomepeculiarinfirmityoccasionedbyexcessiveapplicationtotheir
peculiar species of work. Ramuzzini, an eminent Italian physician, has
written a particular book concerning such diseases. We do not reckon our
soldiers the most industrious set of people among us. Yet when soldiers
havebeenemployedinsomeparticularsortsofwork,andliberallypaidby

undertaker, that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain sum
everyday,accordingtotherateatwhichtheywerepaid. Tillthisstipula-

andsometimesfatal,andsuchasalmostalways,soonerorlater,bringson
the peculiar infirmity of the trade. If masters would always listen to the
dictates of reason and humanity, they have frequently occasion rather to
moderate than to animate the application of many of their workmen. It
will be found, I believe, in every sort of trade, that the man who works so
moderately as to be able to work constantly not only preserves his health
the longest, but, in the course of the year, executes the greatest quantity
ofwork.
201 [45] Incheapyears,itispretended,workmenaregenerallymoreidle,andin
dear ones more industrious than ordinary. A plentiful subsistence, there-
fore, it has been concluded, relaxes, and a scanty one quickens their in-
dustry. Thatalittlemoreplentythanordinarymayrendersomeworkmen
idle, cannot well be doubted; but that it should have this effect upon the
greater part, or that men in general should work better when they are ill
fed than when they are well fed, when they are disheartened than when
theyareingoodspirits,whentheyarefrequentlysickthanwhentheyare G.ed.p101
generally in good health, seems not very probable. Years of dearth, it is
to be observed, are generally among the common people years of sickness
andmortality,whichcannotfailtodiminishtheproduceoftheirindustry.
202 [46] In years of plenty, servants frequently leave their masters, and trust
their subsistence to what they can make by their own industry. But the
samecheapnessofprovisions,byincreasingthefundwhichisdestinedfor
the maintenance of servants, encourages masters, farmers especially, to
employagreaternumber. Farmersuponsuchoccasionsexpectmoreprofit
from their corn by maintaining a few more labouring servants than by
sellingitatalowpriceinthemarket. Thedemandforservantsincreases,
while the number of those who offer to supply that demand diminishes.
Thepriceoflabour,therefore,frequentlyrisesincheapyears.
203 [47] In years of scarcity, the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make
all such people eager to return to service. But the high price of provi-
sions, by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of servants,
disposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the number of those
they have. In dear years, too, poor independent workmen frequently con-
sumethelittlestockswithwhichtheyhadusedtosupplythemselveswith
thematerialsoftheirwork,andareobligedtobecomejourneymenforsub-
sistence. More people want employment than can easily get it; many are
willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary, and the wages of both
servantsandjourneymenfrequentlysinkindearyears.
204 [48] Masters of all sorts, therefore, frequently make better bargains with
their servants in dear than in cheap years, and find them more humble
anddependentintheformerthaninthelatter. Theynaturally, therefore,
commendtheformerasmorefavourabletoindustry. Landlordsandfarm-
ers,besides,twoofthelargestclassesofmasters,haveanotherreasonfor
being pleased with dear years. The rents of the one and the profits of the
otherdependverymuchuponthepriceofprovisions. Nothingcanbemore
69 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
absurd, however, than to imagine that men in general should work less
when they work for themselves, than when they work for other people. A
poorindependentworkmanwillgenerallybemoreindustriousthanevena
journeyman who works by the piece. The one enjoys the whole produce of
hisownindustry; theothersharesitwithhismaster. Theone,inhissep-
arate independent state, is less liable to the temptations of bad company,
which in large manufactories so frequently ruin the morals of the other.
Thesuperiority oftheindependent workman overthose servants whoare
hiredbythemonthorbytheyear,andwhosewagesandmaintenanceare
the same whether they do much or do little, is likely to be still greater.
Cheap years tend to increase the proportion of independent workmen to G.ed.p102
journeymenandservantsofallkinds,anddearyearstodiminishit.
205 [49] A French author of great knowledge and ingenuity, Mr. Messance, re-
ceiver of the taillies in the election of St. Etienne, endeavours to show
thatthepoordomoreworkincheapthanindearyears,bycomparingthe
quantity and value of the goods made upon those different occasions in
three different manufactures; one of coarse woollens carried on at Elbeuf;
one of linen, and another of silk, both which extend through the whole
generality of Rouen. It appears from his account, which is copied from
theregistersofthepublicoffices,thatthequantityandvalueofthegoods
madeinallthosethreemanufactureshasgenerallybeengreaterincheap
than in dear years; and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest,
and least in the dearest years. All the three seem to be stationary manu-
factures,orwhich,thoughtheirproducemayvarysomewhatfromyearto

206 [50] ThemanufactureoflineninScotland,andthatofcoarsewoollensinthe
WestRidingofYorkshire,aregrowingmanufactures,ofwhichtheproduce
isgenerally,thoughwithsomevariations,increasingbothinquantityand
value. Uponexamining,however,theaccountswhichhavebeenpublished
oftheirannualproduce,Ihavenotbeenabletoobservethatitsvariations
have had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the
seasons. In 1740, a year of great scarcity, both manufactures, indeed, ap-
peartohavedeclinedveryconsiderably. Butin1756,anotheryearofgreat
scarcity,theScotchmanufacturemademorethanordinaryadvances. The
Yorkshire manufacture, indeed, declined, and its produce did not rise to
whatithadbeenin1755till1766,aftertherepealoftheAmericanStamp
Act. In that and the following year it greatly exceeded what it had ever G.ed.p103
beenbefore,andithascontinuedtoadvanceeversince.
207 [51] The produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessar-
ily depend, not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in
the countries where they are carried on as upon the circumstances which
affect the demand in the countries where they are consumed; upon peace
orwar,upontheprosperityordeclensionofotherrivalmanufactures,and
upon the good or bad humour of their principal customers. A great part
oftheextraordinarywork,besides,whichisprobablydoneincheapyears,
70 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
never enters the public registers of manufactures. The men servants who
leave their masters become independent labourers. The women return to
theirparents,andcommonlyspininordertomakecloathsforthemselves
and their families. Even the independent workmen do not always work
for public sale, but are employed by some of their neighbours in manu-
factures for family use. The produce of their labour, therefore, frequently
makes no figure in those public registers of which the records are some-
timespublishedwithsomuchparade,andfromwhichourmerchantsand
manufacturers would often vainly pretend to announce the prosperity or
declensionofthegreatestempires.
208 [52] Though the variations in the price of labour not only do not always
correspond with those in the price of provisions, but are frequently quite
opposite, we must not, upon this account, imagine that the price of provi-
sions has no influence upon that of labour. The money price of labour is
necessarily regulated by two circumstances; the demand for labour, and
the price of the necessaries and conveniences of life. The demand for la-
bour,accordingasithappenstobeincreasing,stationary,ordeclining,orto
require an increasing, stationary, or declining population, determines the
quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which must be given
to the labourer; and the money price of labour is determined by what is
requisite for purchasing this quantity. Though the money price of labour,
therefore, is sometimes high where the price of provisions is low, it would
be still higher, the demand continuing the same, if the price of provisions
washigh.
209 [53] It is because the demand for labour increases in years of sudden and
extraordinaryplenty,anddiminishesinthoseofsuddenandextraordinary
scarcity, that the money price of labour sometimes rises in the one and
sinksintheother.
210 [54] In a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty, there are funds in the
handsofmanyoftheemployersofindustrysufficienttomaintainandem-
ploy a greater number of industrious people than had been employed the
year before; and this extraordinary number cannot always be had. Those G.ed.p104
masters, therefore, who want more workmen bid against one another, in
order to get them, which sometimes raises both the real and the money
priceoftheirlabour.
[55] The contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary
211
scarcity. The funds destined for employing industry are less than they
had been the year before. A considerable number of people are thrown
out of employment, who bid against one another, in order to get it, which
sometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labour. In 1740, a
year of extraordinary scarcity, many people were willing to work for bare
subsistence. In the succeeding years of plenty, it was more difficult to get
labourersandservants.
[56] Thescarcityofadearyear,bydiminishingthedemandforlabour,tends
212
to lower its price, as the high price of provisions tends to raise it. The
71 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
plenty of a cheap year, on the contrary, by increasing the demand, tends
to raise the price of labour, as the cheapness of provisions tends to lower
it. In the ordinary variations of the price of provisions those two opposite
causes seem to counterbalance one another, which is probably in part the
reasonwhythewagesoflabourareeverywheresomuchmoresteadyand
permanentthanthepriceofprovisions.
213 [57] The increase in the wages of labour necessarily increases the price of
many commodities, by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into
wages, and so far tends to diminish their consumption both at home and
abroad. The same cause, however, which raises the wages of labour, the
increase of stock, tends to increase its productive powers, and to make a
smallerquantityoflabourproduceagreaterquantityofwork. Theowner
of the stock which employs a great number of labourers, necessarily en-
deavours, for his own advantage, to make such a proper division and dis-
tributionofemploymentthattheymaybeenabledtoproducethegreatest

G.ed.p105
OF THE PROFITS OF STOCK
[1] THEriseandfallintheprofitsofstockdependuponthesamecauseswith
214
the rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining state
of the wealth of the society; but those causes affect the one and the other
verydifferently.
215 [2] The increase of stock, which raises wages, tends to lower profit. When
the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade, their
mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit; and when there is
a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same
society,thesamecompetitionmustproducethesameeffectinthemall.
216 [3] It is not easy, it has already been observed, to ascertain what are the
average wages of labour even in a particular place, and at a particular
time. Wecan,eveninthiscase,seldomdeterminemorethanwhatarethe
most usual wages. But even this can seldom be done with regard to the
profits of stock. Profit is so very fluctuating that the person who carries
on a particular trade cannot always tell you himself what is the average
of his annual profit. It is affected not only by every variation of price in
the commodities which he deals in, but by the good or bad fortune both
of his rivals and of his customers, and by a thousand other accidents to
whichgoodswhencarriedeitherbyseaorbyland,orevenwhenstoredin
awarehouse,areliable. Itvaries,therefore,notonlyfromyeartoyear,but
from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. To ascertain what is the
averageprofitofallthedifferenttradescarriedoninagreatkingdommust
bemuchmoredifficult;andtojudgeofwhatitmayhavebeenformerly,or
inremoteperiodsoftime,withanydegreeofprecision,mustbealtogether
impossible.
217 [4] But though it may be impossible to determine, with any degree of pre-
cision, what are or were the average profits of stock, either in the present
or in ancient times, some notion may be formed of them from the interest
ofmoney. Itmaybelaiddownasamaxim,thatwhereveragreatdealcan
be made by the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given for the
use of it; and that wherever little can be made by it, less will commonly
be given for it. According, therefore, as the usual market rate of interest
variesinanycountry,wemaybeassuredthattheordinaryprofitsofstock
mustvarywithit,mustsinkasitsinks,andriseasitrises. Theprogress TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of interest, therefore, may lead us to form some notion of the progress of G.ed.p106
profit.

reignofEdwardVIreligiouszealprohibitedallinterest. Thisprohibition,
however, like all others of the same kind, is said to have produced no ef-
fect,andprobablyratherincreasedthandiminishedtheevilofusury. The

per cent continued to be the legal rate of interest till the 21st of James I.
whenitwasrestrictedtoeightpercent. Itwasreducedtosixpercentsoon
after the Restoration, and by the 12th of Queen Anne to five per cent. All
these different statutory regulations seem to have been made with great
propriety. They seem to have followed and not to have gone before the
market rate of interest, or the rate at which people of good credit usually
borrowed. SincethetimeofQueenAnne,fivepercentseemstohavebeen
ratherabovethanbelowthemarketrate. Beforethelatewar,thegovern-
ment borrowed at three per cent; and people of good credit in the capital,
andinmanyotherpartsofthekingdom,atthreeandahalf,four,andfour
andahalfpercent.
219 [6] Since the time of Henry VIII the wealth and revenue of the country
havebeencontinuallyadvancing,and,inthecourseoftheirprogress,their
paceseemsrathertohavebeengraduallyacceleratedthanretarded. They
seemnotonlytohavebeengoingon,buttohavebeengoingonfasterand
faster. The wages of labour have been continually increasing during the
sameperiod,andinthegreaterpartofthedifferentbranchesoftradeand
manufacturestheprofitsofstockhavebeendiminishing.
220 [7] It generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in a
great town than in a country village. The great stocks employed in every
branch of trade, and the number ofrich competitors, generallyreduce the
rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter But the wages G.ed.p107
of labour are generally higher in a great town than in a country village.
In a thriving town the people who have great stocks to employ frequently
cannot get the number of workmen they want, and therefore bid against
oneanotherinordertogetasmanyastheycan,whichraisesthewagesof
labour, and lowers the profits of stock. In the remote parts of the country
thereisfrequentlynotstocksufficienttoemployallthepeople,whothere-
forebidagainstoneanotherinordertogetemployment,whichlowersthe

[8] InScotland,thoughthelegalrateofinterestisthesameasinEngland,
221
the market rate is rather higher. People of the best credit there seldom
borrow under five per cent. Even private bankers in Edinburgh give four
per cent upon their promissory notes, of which payment either in whole
or in part may be demanded at pleasure. Private bankers in London give
no interest for the money which is deposited with them. There are few
tradeswhichcannotbecarriedonwithasmallerstockinScotlandthanin
74 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
England. Thecommonrateofprofit,therefore,mustbesomewhatgreater.
The wages of labour, it has already been observed, are lower in Scotland
than in England. The country, too, is not only much poorer, but the steps
by which it advances to a better condition, for it is evidently advancing,
seemtobemuchslowerandmoretardy.
[9] The legal rate of interest in France has not, during the course of the
222
present century, been always regulated by the market rate. In 1720 in-
terest was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny, or from five
to two per cent. In 1724 it was raised to the thirtieth penny, or to 31 per
3
cent. In 1725 it was again raised to the twentieth penny, or to five per
cent. In 1766, during the administration of Mr. Laverdy, it was reduced
to the twenty-fifth penny, or to four per cent. The Abbe Terray raised it
afterwards to the old rate of five per cent. The supposed purpose of many
ofthoseviolentreductionsofinterestwastopreparethewayforreducing
that of the public debts; a purpose which has sometimes been executed.
France is perhaps in the present times not so rich a country as England;
and though the legal rate of interest has in France frequently been lower
than in England, the market rate has generally been higher; for there, as
inothercountries,theyhaveseveralverysafeandeasymethodsofevading
thelaw. Theprofitsoftrade,IhavebeenassuredbyBritishmerchantswho
had traded in both countries, are higher in France than in England; and G.ed.p108
it is no doubt upon this account that many British subjects choose rather
to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace, than in
one where it is highly respected. The wages of labour are lower in France
than in England. When you go from Scotland to England, the difference

[11] In our North American and West Indian colonies, not only the wages
224
of labour, but the interest of money, and consequently the profits of stock,
are higher than in England. In the different colonies both the legal and
the market rate of interest run from six to eight per cent. High wages of
labourandhighprofitsofstock,however,arethings,perhaps,whichscarce
ever go together, except in the peculiar circumstances of new colonies. A

it is often easy to get more. The great difficulty is to get that little. The
connection between the increase of stock and that of industry, or of the

225 [12] Theacquisitionofnewterritory,orofnewbranchesoftrade,maysome-
timesraisetheprofitsofstock,andwiththemtheinterestofmoney,even

stock of the country not being sufficient for the whole accession of busi-
ness,whichsuchacquisitionspresenttothedifferentpeopleamongwhom
it is divided, is applied to those particular branches only which afford the
greatest profit. Part of what had before been employed in other trades is
necessarily withdrawn from them, and turned into some of the new and
more profitable ones. In all those old trades, therefore, the competition
comes to be less than before. The market comes to be less fully supplied
with many different sorts of goods. Their price necessarily rises more or
less,andyieldsagreaterprofittothosewhodealinthem,whocan,there-

clusionofthelatewar,notonlyprivatepeopleofthebestcredit,butsome

who before that had not been used to pay more than four, and four and a

berofparticularbranches,inwhichthecompetitionbeingless,theprofits
must have been greater. I shall hereafter have occasion to mention the
reasonswhichdisposemetobelievethatthecapitalstockofGreatBritain
wasnotdiminishedevenbytheenormousexpenseofthelatewar.
226 [13] The diminution of the capital stock of the society, or of the funds
destined for the maintenance of industry, however, as it lowers the wages
of labour, so it raises the profits of stock, and consequently the interest of
money. Bythewagesoflabourbeinglowered,theownersofwhatstockre-
mains in the society can bring their goods at less expense to market than G.ed.p111
before,andlessstockbeingemployedinsupplyingthemarketthanbefore,
they can sell them dearer. Their goods cost them less, and they get more
forthem. Theirprofits,therefore,beingaugmentedatbothends,canwell
afford a large interest. The great fortunes so suddenly and so easily ac-
quiredinBengalandtheotherBritishsettlementsintheEastIndiesmay
satisfy us that, as the wages of labour are very low, so the profits of stock
are very high in those ruined countries. The interest of money is propor-
tionably so. In Bengal, money is frequently lent to the farmers at forty,
fifty, and sixty per cent and the succeeding crop is mortgaged for the pay-
ment. Astheprofitswhichcanaffordsuchaninterestmusteatupalmost

227 [14] In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which
the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other
countries,allowedittoacquire;whichcould,therefore,advancenofurther,
and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the
profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in
proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ,
thecompetitionforemploymentwouldnecessarilybesogreatastoreduce
the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number
of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number
could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to
all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be
employedineveryparticularbranchasthenatureandextentofthetrade

andconsequentlytheordinaryprofitaslowaspossible.
228 [15] Butperhapsnocountryhaseveryetarrivedatthisdegreeofopulence.
China seems to have been long stationary, and had probably long ago ac-
quired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature
of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior
to what, with other laws and institutions, the nature of its soil, climate, G.ed.p112
and situation might admit of. A country which neglects or despises for-
eigncommerce,andwhichadmitsthevesselsofforeignnationsintooneor

affordthislargeinterest.
229 [16] A defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest consid-
erably above what the condition of the country, as to wealth or poverty,
would require. When the law does not enforce the performance of con-
tracts, it puts all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts
orpeopleofdoubtfulcreditinbetterregulatedcountries. Theuncertainty

of contracts was left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties.
The courts of justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it. The high
rate of interest which took place in those ancient times may perhaps be
partlyaccountedforfromthiscause.
230 [17] Whenthelawprohibitsinterestaltogether,itdoesnotpreventit. Many
people must borrow, and nobody will lend without such a consideration
for the use of their money as is suitable not only to what can be made
by the use of it, but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law. The
high rate of interest among all Mahometan nations is accounted for by

out of it would be so low as to render it impossible for any but the very
wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their money. All people of
smallormiddlingfortuneswouldbeobligedtosuperintendthemselvesthe
employment of their own stocks. It would be necessary that almost every
man should be a man of business, or engage in some sort of trade. The
provinceofHollandseemstobeapproachingneartothisstate. Itisthere
unfashionable not to be a man of business. Necessity makes it usual for
almost every man to be so, and custom everywhere regulates fashion. As
it is ridiculous not to dress, so is it, in some measure, not to be employed,
likeotherpeople. Asamanofacivilprofessionseemsawkwardinacamp
or a garrison, and is even in some danger of being despised there, so does
anidlemanamongmenofbusiness.
234 [21] The highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as, in the price of the
greater part of commodities, eats up the whole of what should go to the
rent of the land, and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labour of
preparing and bringing them to market, according to the lowest rate at
79 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
which labour can anywhere be paid, the bare subsistence of the labourer.
The workman must always have been fed in some way or other while he
wasaboutthework;butthelandlordmaynotalwayshavebeenpaid. The
profitsofthetradewhichtheservantsoftheEastIndiaCompanycarryon G.ed.p114
inBengalmaynotperhapsbeveryfarfromthisrate.
235 [22] Theproportionwhichtheusualmarketrateofinterestoughttobearto
the ordinary rate of clear profit, necessarily varies as profit rises or falls.
Double interest is in Great Britain reckoned what the merchants call a
good,moderate,reasonableprofit;termswhichIapprehendmeannomore
than a common and usual profit. In a country where the ordinary rate
of clear profit is eight or ten per cent, it may be reasonable that one half
of it should go to interest, wherever business is carried on with borrowed
money. Thestockisattheriskoftheborrower, who, asitwere, insuresit
to the lender; and four or five per cent may, in the greater part of trades,
be both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this insurance, and a sufficient
recompense for the trouble of employing the stock. But the proportion
betweeninterestandclearprofitmightnotbethesameincountrieswhere
the ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal lower, or a good deal
higher. If it were a good deal lower, one half of it perhaps could not be
afforded for interest; and more might be afforded if it were a good deal
higher.
236 [23] In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit
may, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of
labour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving
neighbours,amongwhomthewagesoflabourmaybelower.
237 [24] In reality high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than
high wages. If in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the
differentworkingpeople,theflax-dressers,thespinners,theweavers,etc.,
should, all of them, be advanced twopence a day; it would be necessary to
heightenthepriceofapieceoflinenonlybyanumberoftwopencesequal
tothenumberofpeoplethathadbeenemployedaboutit,multipliedbythe
numberofdaysduringwhichtheyhadbeensoemployed. Thatpartofthe
priceofthecommoditywhichresolveditselfintowageswould,throughall
the different stages of the manufacture, rise only in arithmetical propor-
tiontothisriseofwages. Butiftheprofitsofallthedifferentemployersof
those working people should be raised five per cent, that part of the price
of the commodity which resolved itself into profit would, through all the
different stages of the manufacture, rise in geometrical proportion to this
riseofprofit. Theemployeroftheflaxdresserswouldinsellinghisflaxre-
quireanadditionalfivepercentuponthewholevalueofthematerialsand
wages which he advanced to his workmen. The employer of the spinners
would require an additional five per cent both upon the advanced price G.ed.p115
of the flax and upon the wages of the spinners. And the employer of the
weavers would require a like five per cent both upon the advanced price
of the linen yarn and upon the wages of the weavers. In raising the price
80 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of commodities the rise of wages operates in the same manner as simple
interest does in the accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates like
compound interest. Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain
much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby

OF WAGES AND PROFIT IN THE
DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS OF LABOUR
AND STOCK
238 [1] THE whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employ-
ments of labour and stock must, in the same neighbourhood, be either
perfectly equal or continually tending to equality. If in the same neigh-
bourhood,therewasanyemploymentevidentlyeithermoreorlessadvant-
ageous than the rest, so many people would crowd into it in the one case,
and so many would desert it in the other, that its advantages would soon
returntothelevelofotheremployments. Thisatleastwouldbethecasein

andtoshunthedisadvantageousemployment.
239 [2] Pecuniary wages and profit, indeed, are everywhere in Europe ex-
tremely different according to the different employments of labour and
stock. But this difference arises partly from certain circumstances in the
employments themselves, which, either really, or at least in the imagina-
tions of men, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and counter-
balanceagreatoneinothers;andpartlyfromthepolicyofEurope,which
nowhereleavesthingsatperfectliberty.
240 [3] The particular consideration of those circumstances and of that policy
willdividethischapterintotwoparts. TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
PART I
Inequalities arising from the Nature of the
Employments themselves
[1] The five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have
241
beenabletoobserve,makeupforasmallpecuniarygaininsomeemploy-
ments, and counterbalance a great one in others: first, the agreeableness
ordisagreeablenessoftheemploymentsthemselves;secondly,theeasiness
andcheapness,orthedifficultyandexpenseoflearningthem;thirdly,the
constancy or inconstancy of employment in them; fourthly, the small or G.ed.p117
greattrustwhichmustbereposedinthosewhoexercisethem;and,fifthly,
theprobabilityorimprobabilityofsuccessinthem.
[2] First, the wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanli-
242
nessordirtiness,thehonourablenessordishonourablenessoftheemploy-
ment. Thusinmostplaces,taketheyearround,ajourneymantailorearns

butitismuchcleanlier. Ajourneymanblacksmith,thoughanartificer,sel-
domearnssomuchintwelvehoursasacollier,whoisonlyalabourer,does
in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less dangerous, and is carried
on in daylight, and above ground. Honour makes a great part of the re-
ward of all honourable professions. In point of pecuniary gain, all things
considered,theyaregenerallyunder-recompensed,asIshallendeavourto
show by and by. Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade of a butcher
isabrutalandanodiousbusiness;butitisinmostplacesmoreprofitable
than the greater part of common trades. The most detestable of all em-
ployments, that of public executioner, is, in proportion to the quantity of
workdone,betterpaidthananycommontradewhatever.
243 [3] Hunting and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in
the rude state of society, become in its advanced state their most agree-
able amusements, and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed
fromnecessity. Intheadvancedstateofsociety,therefore,theyareallvery G.ed.p118
poor people who follow as a trade what other people pursue as a pastime.
Fishermenhavebeensosincethetimeof1Theocritus. Apoacherisevery-
where a very poor man in Great Britain. In countries where the rigour of
the law suffers no poachers, the licensed hunter is not in a much better
condition. The natural taste for those employments makes more people
follow them than can live comfortably by them, and the produce of their
labour, in proportion to its quantity, comes always too cheap to market to
affordanythingbutthemostscantysubsistencetothelabourers.
1[Smith]SeeIdylliumxxi.
83 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
[4] Disagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same
244
manner as the wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is
never master of his own house, and who is exposed to the brutality of
every drunkard, exercises neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable
business. But there is scarce any common trade in which a small stock
yieldssogreataprofit.
245 [5] Secondly,thewagesoflabourvarywiththeeasinessandcheapness,or
thedifficultyandexpenseoflearningthebusiness.
246 [6] When any expensive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be
performedbyitbeforeitiswornout, itmustbeexpected, willreplacethe
capitallaidoutuponit,withatleasttheordinaryprofits. Amaneducated
attheexpenseofmuchlabourandtimetoanyofthoseemploymentswhich

of an equally valuable capital. It must do this, too, in a reasonable time,
regardbeinghadtotheveryuncertaindurationofhumanlife,inthesame G.ed.p119
mannerastothemorecertaindurationofthemachine.
247 [7] Thedifferencebetweenthewagesofskilledlabourandthoseofcommon
labourisfoundeduponthisprinciple.
248 [8] The policy of Europe considers the labour of all mechanics, artificers,
andmanufacturers, asskilledlabour; andthatofallcountrylabourersas
commonlabour. Itseemstosupposethatoftheformertobeofamorenice
anddelicatenaturethanthatofthelatter. Itissoperhapsinsomecases;
but in the greater part is it quite otherwise, as I shall endeavour to show
by and by. The laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to qualify
any person for exercising the one species of labour, impose the necessity
of an apprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in different
places. They leave the other free and open to everybody. During the con-
tinuanceoftheapprenticeship,thewholelabouroftheapprenticebelongs
tohismaster. Inthemeantimehemust,inmanycases,bemaintainedby
his parents or relations, and in almost all cases must be clothed by them.
Some money, too, is commonly given to the master for teaching him his
trade. They who cannot give money give time, or become bound for more
than the usual number of years; a consideration which, though it is not
alwaysadvantageoustothemaster,onaccountoftheusualidlenessofap-
prentices,isalwaysdisadvantageoustotheapprentice. Incountrylabour,
onthecontrary,thelabourer,whileheisemployedabouttheeasier,learns
themoredifficultpartsofhisbusiness,andhisownlabourmaintainshim
throughallthedifferentstagesofhisemployment. Itisreasonable,there-
fore, that in Europe the wages of mechanics, artificers, and manufactur-
ers,shouldbesomewhathigherthanthoseofcommonlabourers. Theyare
soaccordingly,andtheirsuperiorgainsmaketheminmostplacesbecon-
sideredasasuperiorrankofpeople. Thissuperiority,however,isgenerally
84 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
very small; the daily or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more com-
monsortsofmanufactures,suchasthoseofplainlinenandwoollencloth,
computedatanaverage,are,inmostplaces,verylittlemorethantheday
wages of common labourers. Their employment, indeed, is more steady
and uniform, and the superiority of their earnings, taking the whole year
together, may be somewhat greater. It seems evidently, however, to be no
greaterthanwhatissufficienttocompensatethesuperiorexpenseoftheir
education.
249 [9] Education in the ingenious arts and in the liberal professions is still
more tedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompense, therefore, of
paintersandsculptors, oflawyersandphysicians, oughttobemuchmore
liberal;anditissoaccordingly.
250 [10] The profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or G.ed.p120
difficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed. All the different
waysinwhichstockiscommonlyemployedingreattownsseem,inreality,
tobealmostequallyeasyandequallydifficulttolearn. Onebrancheither
offoreignordomestictradecannotwellbeamuchmoreintricatebusiness
thananother.
251 [11] Thirdly,thewagesoflabourindifferentoccupationsvarywiththecon-
stancyorinconstancyofemployment.
252 [12] Employment is much more constant in some trades than in others. In
the greater part of manufacturers, a journeyman may be pretty sure of
employmentalmosteverydayintheyearthatheisabletowork. Amason
or bricklayer, on the contrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul
weather, and his employment at all other times depends upon the occa-
sionalcallsofhiscustomers. Heisliable,inconsequence,tobefrequently
without any. What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, must not
only maintain him while he is idle, but make him some compensation for
those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precari-
ous a situation must sometimes occasion. Where the computed earnings
of the greater part of manufacturers, accordingly, are nearly upon a level
withthedaywagesofcommonlabourers,thoseofmasonsandbricklayers
are generally from one half more to double those wages. Where common
labourersearnfourandfiveshillingsaweek,masonsandbricklayersfre-
quently earn seven and eight; where the former earn six, the latter often
earnnineandten;andwheretheformerearnnineandten,asinLondon,
thelattercommonlyearnfifteenandeighteen. Nospeciesofskilledlabour,
however, seems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers.
Chairmen in London, during the summer season, are said sometimes to
be employed as bricklayers. The high wages of those workmen, therefore,
arenotsomuchtherecompenseoftheirskill,asthecompensationforthe
inconstancyoftheiremployment.
253 [13] Ahousecarpenterseemstoexerciseratheranicerandmoreingenious

day-wagesaresomewhatlower. Hisemployment,thoughitdependsmuch,
85 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
doesnotdependsoentirelyupontheoccasionalcallsofhiscustomers;and
itisnotliabletobeinterruptedbytheweather.
254 [14] When the trades which generally afford constant employment happen
in a particular place not to do so, the wages of the workmen always rise
a good deal above their ordinary proportion to those of common labour.
In London almost all journeymen artificers are liable to be called upon
and dismissed by their masters from day to day, and from week to week,
in the same manner as day-labourers in other places. The lowest order
of artificers, journeymen tailors, accordingly, earn there half a crown a- G.ed.p121
day, though eighteenpence may be reckoned the wages of common labour.
In small towns and country villages, the wages of journeymen tailors fre-
quentlyscarceequalthoseofcommonlabour;butinLondontheyareoften
manyweekswithoutemployment,particularlyduringthesummer.
255 [15] When the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship,
disagreeablenessanddirtinessofthework,itsometimesraisesthewages
of the most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A
collier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly
about double, and in many parts of Scotland about three times the wages
of common labour. His high wages arise altogether from the hardship,
disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon
most occasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in Lon-
don exercise a trade which in hardship, dirtiness, and disagreeableness,
almostequalsthatofcolliers;andfromtheunavoidableirregularityinthe
arrivals of coal-ships, the employment of the greater part of them is ne-
cessarilyveryinconstant. Ifcolliers,therefore,commonlyearndoubleand
triplethewagesofcommonlabour,itoughtnottoseemunreasonablethat
coal-heavers should sometimes earn four and five times those wages. In

lingsaday. Sixshillingsareaboutfourtimesthewagesofcommonlabour

always be considered as those of the far greater number. How extravag-
ant soever those earnings may appear, if they were more than sufficient G.ed.p122
to compensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the business, there
would soon be so great a number of competitors as, in a trade which has
noexclusiveprivilege,wouldquicklyreducethemtoalowerrate.
256 [16] Theconstancyorinconstancyofemploymentcannotaffecttheordinary
profits of stock in any particular trade. Whether the stock is or is not
constantlyemployeddepends. notuponthetrade,butthetrader.
257 [17] Fourthly, the wages of labour vary accordingly to the small or great
trustwhichmustbereposedintheworkmen.
258 [18] Thewagesofgoldsmithsandjewellersareeverywheresuperiortothose
ofmanyotherworkmen,notonlyofequal,butofmuchsuperioringenuity,
onaccountofthepreciousmaterialswithwhichtheyareintrusted.
259 [19] We trust our health to the physician: our fortune and sometimes our
86 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not
safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward
must be such, therefore, as may give them that rank in the society which
soimportantatrustrequires. Thelongtimeandthegreatexpensewhich
mustbelaidoutintheireducation,whencombinedwiththiscircumstance,
necessarilyenhancestillfurtherthepriceoftheirlabour.
260 [20] When a person employs only his own stock in trade, there is no trust;
and the credit which he may get from other people depends, not upon the
nature of his trade, but upon their opinion of his fortune, probity, and
prudence. Thedifferentratesofprofit,therefore,inthedifferentbranches
of trade, cannot arise from the different degrees of trust reposed in the
traders.
261 [21] Fifthly, the wages of labour in different. employments vary according
totheprobabilityorimprobabilityofsuccessinthem.
262 [22] The probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for
theemploymenttowhichheiseducatedisverydifferentindifferentoccu-
pations. In the greater part of mechanic trades, success is almost certain;
but very uncertain in the liberal professions. Put your son apprentice to
a shoemaker, there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes;
butsendhimtostudythelaw,itisatleasttwentytooneifeverhemakes
such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business. In a perfectly
fair lottery, those who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lost by
thosewhodrawtheblanks. Inaprofessionwheretwentyfailforonethat

unsuccessful twenty. The counsellor-at-law who, perhaps, at near forty
yearsofage,beginstomakesomethingbyhisprofession,oughttoreceive
theretribution,notonlyofhisownsotediousandexpensiveeducation,but
thatofmorethantwentyotherswhoareneverlikelytomakeanythingby
it. How extravagant soever the fees of counsellors-at-law may sometimes
appear, their real retribution is never equal to this. Compute in any par-
ticularplacewhatislikelytobeannuallygained, andwhatislikelytobe
annuallyspent,byallthedifferentworkmeninanycommontrade,suchas
thatofshoemakersorweavers,andyouwillfindthattheformersumwill

andyouwillfindthattheirannualgainsbearbutaverysmallproportion

farfrombeingaperfectlyfairlottery;andthat,aswellasmanyotherlib-
eralandhonourableprofessions,are,inpointofpecuniarygain,evidently
under-recompensed.
263 [23] Those professions keep their level, however, with other occupations,
and, notwithstanding these discouragements, all the most generous and
liberal spirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different causes contrib-
ute torecommend them. First, the desire of the reputation whichattends
87 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
uponsuperiorexcellenceinanyofthem;and,secondly,thenaturalconfid-
ence which every man has more or less, not only in his own abilities, but
inhisowngoodfortune.
264 [24] Toexcelinanyprofession,inwhichbutfewarriveatmediocrity,isthe
mostdecisivemarkofwhatiscalledgeniusorsuperiortalents. Thepublic
admirationwhichattendsuponsuchdistinguishedabilitiesmakesalways
a part of their reward; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher
or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the
profession of physic; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and
philosophyitmakesalmostthewhole.
265 [25] There are some very agreeable and beautiful talents of which the pos- G.ed.p124
session commands a certain sort of admiration; but of which the exercise
for the sake of gain is considered, whether from reason or prejudice, as a
sort of public prostitution. The pecuniary recompense, therefore, of those
who exercise them in this manner must be sufficient, not only to pay for
thetime,labour,andexpenseofacquiringthetalents,butforthediscredit
which attends the employment of them as the means of subsistence. The
exorbitantrewardsofplayers,opera-singers,opera-dancers,etc.,arefoun-
ded upon those two principles; the rarity and beauty of the talents, and
the discredit of employing them in this manner. It seems absurd at first
sight that we should despise their persons and yet reward their talents
with the most profuse liberality. While we do the one, however, we must
of necessity do the other. Should the public opinion or prejudice ever al-
ter with regard to such occupations, their pecuniary recompense would
quickly diminish. More people would apply to them, and the competition
would quickly reduce the price of their labour. Such talents, though far
frombeingcommon,arebynomeanssorareasisimagined. Manypeople
possess them in great perfection, who disdain to make this use of them;
and many more are capable of acquiring them, if anything could be made
honourablybythem.
266 [26] The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their
ownabilitiesisanancientevilremarkedbythephilosophersandmoralists
of all ages. Their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been
less taken notice of. It is, however, if possible, still more universal. There
is no man living who, when in tolerable health and spirits, has not some
share of it. The chance of gain is by every man more or less overvalued, G.ed.p125
andthechanceoflossisbymostmenundervalued,andbyscarceanyman,
whoisintolerablehealthandspirits,valuedmorethanitisworth.
267 [27] Thatthechanceofgainisnaturallyovervalued,wemaylearnfromthe
universal success of lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will
see, a perfectly fair lottery; or one in which the whole gain compensated
the whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the
state lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid by
the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for twenty,
thirty, and sometimes forty per cent advance. The vain hope of gaining
88 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand. The soberest
people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the chance of
gainingtenortwentythousandpounds; thoughtheyknowthateventhat
small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent more than the chance is
worth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds, though in
other respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one than the
common state lotteries, there would not be the same demand for tickets.
In order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes, some people
purchaseseveraltickets,andothers,smallshareinastillgreaternumber.
There is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematics than
that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more likely you are to be a
loser. Adventureuponalltheticketsinthelottery,andyouloseforcertain;
andthegreaterthenumberofyourticketstheneareryouapproachtothis
certainty.
268 [28] Thatthechanceoflossisfrequentlyundervalued,andscarceeverval-
ued more than it is worth, we may learn from a very moderate profit of
insurers. In order to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a trade
atall,thecommonpremiummustbesufficienttocompensatethecommon
losses, to pay the expense of management, and to afford such a profit as
might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any common
trade. The person who pays no more than this evidently pays no more
thantherealvalueoftherisk,orthelowestpriceatwhichhecanreason-
ablyexpecttoinsureit. Butthoughmanypeoplehavemadealittlemoney
by insurance, very few have made a great fortune; and from this consid-
eration alone, it seems evident enough that the ordinary balance of profit
andlossisnotmoreadvantageousinthisthaninothercommontradesby
whichsomanypeoplemakefortunes. Moderate,however,asthepremium
of insurance commonly is, many people despise the risk too much to care
to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen houses in
twenty, or rather perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred, are not insured from G.ed.p126
fire. Sea risk is more alarming to the greater part of people, and the pro-
portion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater. Many fail,
however, at all seasons, and even in time of war, without any insurance.
This may sometimes perhaps be done without any imprudence. When a
great company, or even a great merchant, has twenty or thirty ships at
sea, they may, as it were, insure one another. The premium saved upon
themallmaymorethancompensatesuchlossesastheyarelikelytomeet
withinthecommoncourseofchances. Theneglectofinsuranceuponship-
ping, however, in the same manner as upon houses, is, in most cases, the
effect of no such nice calculation, but of mere thoughtless rashness and
presumptuouscontemptoftherisk.
269 [29] The contempt of risk and the presumptuous hope of success are in no
period of life more active than at the age at which young people choose
their professions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of bal-
ancingthehopeofgoodluckappearsstillmoreevidentlyinthereadiness
89 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of the common People to enlist as soldiers, or to go to sea, than in the
eagerness of those of better fashion to enter into what are called the lib-
eralprofessions.
270 [30] What a common soldier may lose is obvious enough. Without regard-
ing the danger, however, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at
the beginning of a new war; and though they have scarce any chance of
preferment,theyfiguretothemselves,intheiryouthfulfancies,athousand
occasionsofacquiringhonouranddistinctionwhichneveroccur. Thesero-
mantic hopes make the whole price of their blood. Their pay is less than
that of common labourers, and in actual service their fatigues are much
greater.
271 [31] The lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of
the army. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go
to sea with his father’s consent; but if he enlists as a soldier, it is always
without it. Other people see some chance of his making something by
the one trade: nobody but himself sees any of his making anything by
the other. The great admiral is less the object of public admiration than
the great general, and the highest success in the sea service promises a
less brilliant fortune and reputation than equal success in the land. The
samedifferencerunsthroughalltheinferiordegreesofprefermentinboth.
By the rules of precedency a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in
the army; but he does not rank with him in the common estimation. As
the great prizes in the lottery are less, the smaller ones must be more
numerous. Common sailors, therefore, more frequently get some fortune G.ed.p127
andprefermentthancommonsoldiers;andthehopeofthoseprizesiswhat
principally recommends the trade. Though their skill and dexterity are
muchsuperiortothatofalmostanyartificers,andthoughtheirwholelife
is one continual scene of hardship and danger, yet for all this dexterity
and skill, for all those hardships and dangers, while they remain in the
conditionofcommonsailors,theyreceivescarceanyotherrecompensebut
the pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their
wages are not greater than those of common labourers at the port which
regulates the rate of seamen’s wages. As they are continually going from
porttoport,themonthlypayofthosewhosailfromallthedifferentportsof
GreatBritainismorenearlyuponalevelthanthatofanyotherworkmen
in those different places; and the rate of the port to and from which the
greatest number sail, that is the port of London, regulates that of all the
rest. At London the wages of the greater part of the different classes of
workmen are about double those of the same classes at Edinburgh. But
the sailors who sail from the port of London seldom earn above three or
four shillings a month more than those who sail from the port of Leith,
and the difference is frequently not so great. In time of peace, and in the
merchant service, the London price is from a guinea to about seven-and-
twentyshillingsthecalendarmonth. AcommonlabourerinLondon,atthe

272 [32] The dangers and hairbreadth escapes of a life of adventures, instead
of disheartening young people, seem frequently to recommend a trade to
them. A tender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is of afraid to
send her son to school at a seaport town, lest the sight of the ships and
the conversation and adventures of the sailors should entice him to go to
sea. Thedistantprospectofhazards,fromwhichwecanhopetoextricate

273 [33] In all the different employments of stock, the ordinary rate of profit
variesmoreorlesswiththecertaintyoruncertaintyofthereturns. These
are in general less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign trade, and G.ed.p128
in some branches of foreign trade than in others; in the trade to North
America,forexample,thaninthattoJamaica. Theordinaryrateofprofit
always rises more or less with the risk. It does not, however, seem to rise
in proportion to it, or so as to compensate it completely. Bankruptcies
are most frequent in the most hazardous trades. The most hazardous of
all trades, that of a smuggler, though when the adventure succeeds it is
likewise the most profitable, is the infallible road to bankruptcy. The pre-
sumptuous hope of success seems to act here as upon all other occasions,
andtoenticesomanyadventurersintothosehazardoustrades,thattheir
competitionreducestheirprofitbelowwhatissufficienttocompensatethe
risk. To compensate it completely, the common returns ought, over and
above the ordinary profits of stock, not only to make up for all occasional
losses,buttoaffordasurplusprofittotheadventurersofthesamenature
with the profit of insurers. But if the common returns were sufficient for
all this, bankruptcies would not be more frequent in these than in other
trades.
274 [34] Of the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour,
two only affect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or disagreeableness
ofthebusiness,andtheriskorsecuritywithwhichitisattended. Inpoint

ordinaryprofitofstock,thoughitriseswiththerisk,doesnotalwaysseem

society or neighbourhood, the average and ordinary rates of profit in the
91 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
differentemploymentsofstockshouldbemorenearlyuponalevelthanthe
pecuniary wages of the different sorts of labour. They are so accordingly.
The difference between the earnings of a common labourer and those of
a well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently much greater than that
between the ordinary profits in any two different branches of trade. The
apparentdifference, besides, intheprofitsofdifferenttrades, isgenerally
a deception arising from our not always distinguishing what ought to be
consideredaswages,fromwhatoughttobeconsideredasprofit.
275 [35] Apothecaries profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncom-
monly extravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no G.ed.p129
more than the reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a
much nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever;
and the trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance. He
is the physician of the poor in all cases, and of the rich when the distress
or danger is not very great. His reward, therefore, ought to be suitable to
his skill and his trust, and it arises generally from the price at which he
sells his drugs. But the whole drugs which the best employed apothecary,
inalargemarkettown,willsellinayear,maynotperhapscosthimabove

276 [36] Inasmallseaporttown, alittlegrocerwillmakefortyorfiftypercent
upon a stock of a single hundred pounds, while a considerable wholesale
merchant in the same place will scarce make eight or ten per cent upon a
stock of ten thousand. The trade of the grocer may be necessary for the
conveniency of the inhabitants, and the narrowness of the market may
not admit the employment of a larger capital in the business. The man,
however, must not only live by his trade, but live by it suitably to the
qualificationswhichitrequires. Besidespossessingalittlecapital,hemust
be able to read, write, and account, and must be a tolerable judge too of,
perhaps, fifty or sixty different sorts of goods, their prices, qualities, and
the markets where they are to be had cheapest. He must have all the
knowledge,inshort,thatisnecessaryforagreatmerchant,whichnothing
hinders him from becoming but the want of a sufficient capital. Thirty or
forty pounds a year cannot be considered as too great a recompense for
the labour of a person so Accomplished. Deduct this from the seemingly
great profits of his capital, and little more will remain, perhaps, than the
ordinaryprofitsofstock. Thegreaterpartoftheapparentprofitis,inthis

try villages. Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery
trade, the wages of the grocer’s labour make but a very trifling addition
92 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to the real profits of so great a stock. The apparent profits of the wealthy
retailer, therefore, are there more nearly upon a level with those of the
wholesale merchant. It is upon this account that goods sold by retail are
generally as cheap and frequently much cheaper in the capital than in
small towns and country villages. Grocery goods, for example, are gener-
allymuchcheaper;breadandbutcher’smeatfrequentlyascheap. Itcosts
no more to bring grocery goods to the great town than to the country vil- G.ed.p130
lage;butitcostsagreatdealmoretobringcornandcattle,asthegreater
part of them must be brought from a much greater distance. The prime
cost of grocery goods, therefore, being the same in both places, they are
cheapest where the least profit is charged upon them. The prime cost of
breadandbutcher’smeatisgreaterinthegreattownthaninthecountry

there, but often equally cheap. In such articles as bread and butcher’s
meat, the same cause, which diminishes apparent profit, increases prime
cost. The extent of the market, by giving employment to greater stocks,
diminishes apparent profit; but by requiring supplies from a greater dis-
tance, it increases prime cost. This diminution of the one and increase
of the other seem, in most cases, nearly to counterbalance one another,
whichisprobablythereasonthat,thoughthepricesofcornandcattleare

278 [38] Though the profits of stock both in the wholesale and retail trade are
generally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages,
yet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the
former, andscarceeverinthelatter. Insmalltownsandcountryvillages,
on account of the narrowness of the market, trade cannot always be ex-
tended as stock extends. In such places, therefore, though the rate of a
particular person’s profits may be very high, the sum or amount of them
canneverbeverygreat,norconsequentlythatofhisannualaccumulation.
In great towns, on the contrary, trade can be extended as stock increases,
andthecreditofafrugalandthrivingmanincreasesmuchfasterthanhis
stock. His trade is extended in proportion to the amount of both, and the
sumoramountofhisprofitsisinproportiontotheextentofhistrade,and
hisannualaccumulationinproportiontotheamountofhisprofits. Itsel-
dom happens, however, that great fortunes are made even in great towns
by any one regular, established, and well-known branch of business, but
in consequence of a long life of industry, frugality, and attention. Sudden
fortunes,indeed,aresometimesmadeinsuchplacesbywhatiscalledthe

that its profits are likely to return to the level of other trades. His profits
and losses, therefore, can bear no regular proportion to those of any one
established and well-known branch of business. A bold adventurer may

279 [39] The five circumstances above mentioned, though they occasion consid-
erable inequalities in the wages of labour and profits of stock, occasion
noneinthewholeoftheadvantagesanddisadvantages,realorimaginary,
ofthedifferentemploymentsofeither. Thenatureofthosecircumstances
is such that they make up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and coun-
terbalanceagreatoneinothers.
280 [40] In order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of
their advantages or disadvantages, three things are requisite even where
there is the most perfect freedom. First, the employments must be well
knownandlongestablishedintheneighbourhood; secondly, theymustbe
in their ordinary, or what may be called their natural state; and, thirdly,
theymustbethesoleorprincipalemploymentsofthosewhooccupythem.
281 [41] First,thisequalitycantakeplaceonlyinthoseemploymentswhichare
wellknown,andhavebeenlongestablishedintheneighbourhood.
282 [42] Where all other circumstances are equal, wages are generally higher
in new than in old trades. When a projector attempts to establish a new
manufacture,hemustatfirstenticehisworkmenfromotheremployments

old established manufactures. Those, on the contrary, for which the de-
mandariseschieflyfromuseornecessity,arelessliabletochange,andthe
sameformorfabricmaycontinueindemandforwholecenturiestogether.
The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be higher in manufactures of
the former than in those of the latter kind. Birmingham deals chiefly in
manufactures of the former kind; Sheffield in those of the latter; and the

283 [43] Theestablishmentofanynewmanufacture,ofanynewbranchofcom-

which the projector promises himself extraordinary profits. These profits

commonly at first very high. When the trade or practice becomes thor-
94 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
oughly established and well known, the competition reduces them to the
levelofothertrades.
284 [44] Secondly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvant-
agesofthedifferentemploymentsoflabourandstock,cantakeplaceonly
in the ordinary, or what may be called the natural state of those employ-
ments.
285 [45] The demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes
greaterandsometimeslessthanusual. Intheonecasetheadvantagesof
theemploymentriseabove,intheothertheyfallbelowthecommonlevel.
The demand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest than
during the greater part of the year; and wages rise with the demand. In
time of war, when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the mer-
chant service into that of the king, the demand for sailors to merchant
ships necessarily rises with their scarcity, and their wages upon such oc-
casions commonly rise from a guinea and seven-and-twenty shillings, to
forty shillings and three pounds a month. In a decaying manufacture, on
thecontrary,manyworkmen,ratherthanquittheiroldtrade,areconten-
ted with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable to the nature of
theiremployment.
286 [46] The profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which
it is employed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary
or average rate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is em-
ployedinbringingittomarket,riseabovetheirproperlevel,andasitfalls
theysinkbelowit. Allcommoditiesaremoreorlessliabletovariationsof
price, but some are much more so than others. In all commodities which
are produced by human industry, the quantity of industry annually em-
ployed is necessarily regulated by the annual demand, in such a manner
thattheaverageannualproducemay,asnearlyaspossible,beequaltothe
average annual consumption. In some employments, it has already been
observed, the same quantity of industry will always produce the same, or
verynearlythesamequantityofcommodities. Inthelinenorwoollenman-
ufactures, for example, the same number of hands will annually work up
verynearlythesamequantityoflinenandwoollencloth. Thevariationsin
themarketpriceofsuchcommodities,therefore,canariseonlyfromsome
accidentalvariationinthedemand. Apublicmourningraisesthepriceof
black cloth. But as the demand for most sorts of plain linen and woollen
cloth is pretty uniform, so is likewise the price. But there are other em-
ploymentsinwhichthesamequantityofindustrywillnotalwaysproduce
the same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of industry, for ex-
ample, will, in different years, produce very different quantities of corn,
wine, hops, sugar, tobacco, etc. The price of such commodities, therefore, G.ed.p133
varies not only with the variations of demand, but with the much greater
and more frequent variations of quantity, and is consequently extremely
fluctuating. But the profit of some of the dealers must necessarily fluctu-
ate with the price of the commodities. The operations of the speculative
95 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
merchant are principally employed about such commodities. He endeav-
ourstobuythemupwhenheforeseesthattheirpriceislikelytorise,and
tosellthemwhenitislikelytofall.
287 [47] Thirdly,thisequalityinthewholeoftheadvantagesanddisadvantages

to be found in the capital of a very rich one. There is no city in Europe, I

the three requisites above mentioned must occasion, even where there is

294 [2] Itdoesthischieflyinthethreefollowingways. First,byrestrainingthe

of labour and stock, by restraining the competition in some employments
toasmallernumberthanmightotherwisebedisposedtoenterintothem.
296 [4] The exclusive privileges of corporations are the principal means it
makesuseofforthispurpose.
297 [5] The exclusive privilege of an incorporated trade necessarily restrains
thecompetition, inthetownwhereitisestablished, tothosewhoarefree
ofthetrade. Tohaveservedanapprenticeshipinthetown,underamaster
properly qualified, is commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this
freedom. The bye laws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number
ofapprenticeswhichanymasterisallowedtohave,andalmostalwaysthe
numberofyearswhicheachapprenticeisobligedtoserve. Theintentionof
both regulations is to restrain the competition to a much smaller number G.ed.p136
than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade. The limitation
of the number of apprentices restrains it directly. A long term of appren-
ticeship restrains it more indirectly, but as effectually, by increasing the
expenseofeducation.
298 [6] In Sheffield no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a
time, by a bye law of the corporation. In Norfolk and Norwich no master
weaver can have more than two apprentices, under pain of forfeiting five
poundsamonthtotheking. Nomasterhattercanhavemorethantwoap-
prenticesanywhereinEngland,orintheEnglishplantations,underpain
of forfeiting five pounds a month, half to the king and half to him who
shallsueinanycourtofrecord. Boththeseregulations,thoughtheyhave
been confirmed by a public law of the kingdom, are evidently dictated by
the same corporation spirit which enacted the bye-law of Sheffield. The
silk weavers in London had scarce been incorporated a year when they
enacted a bye-law restraining any master from having more than two ap-
prentices at a time. It required a particular Act of Parliament to rescind
thisbye-law.
299 [7] Seven years seem anciently to have been, all over Europe, the usual
termestablishedforthedurationofapprenticeshipsinthegreaterpartof
incorporated trades. All such incorporations were anciently called uni-
versities, which indeed is the proper Latin name for any incorporation
whatever. The university of smiths, the university of tailors, etc., are ex-
pressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient
98 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
towns. When those particular incorporations which are now peculiarly
called universities were first established, the term of years which it was
necessarytostudy,inordertoobtainthedegreeofmasterofarts,appears
evidently to have been copied from the terms of apprenticeship in com-
mon trades, of which the incorporations were much more ancient. As to
have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was neces-
saryinordertoentitleanypersontobecomeamaster,andtohavehimself
apprenticed in a common trade; so to have studied seven years under a
masterproperlyqualifiedwasnecessarytoentitlehimtobecomeamaster,
teacher, or doctor (words anciently synonymous) in the liberal arts, and G.ed.p137
tohavescholarsorapprentices(wordslikewiseoriginallysynonymous)to
studyunderhim.
300 [8] By the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statute of Apprentice-
ship, it was enacted, that no person should for the future exercise any
trade, craft, or mystery at that time exercised in England, unless he had
previouslyservedtoitanapprenticeshipofsevenyearsatleast;andwhat
before had been the bye law of many particular corporations became in
England the general and public law of all trades carried on in market
towns. For though the words of the statute are very general, and seem
plainly to include the whole kingdom, by interpretation its operation has
beenlimitedtomarkettowns,ithavingbeenheldthatincountryvillages
apersonmayexerciseseveraldifferenttrades,thoughhehasnotserveda
sevenyears’apprenticeshiptoeach, theybeingnecessaryfortheconveni-
ency of the inhabitants, and the number of people frequently not being
sufficienttosupplyeachwithaparticularsetofhands.
301 [9] Byastrictinterpretationofthewords,too,theoperationofthisstatute
has been limited to those trades which were established in England be-
fore the 5th of Elizabeth, and has never been extended to such as have
been introduced since that time. This limitation has given occasion to
several distinctions which, considered as rules of police, appear as fool-
ish as can well be imagined. It has been adjudged, for example, that a
coachmaker can neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make
hiscoach-wheels,butmustbuythemofamasterwheel-wright;thislatter
trade having been exercised in England before the 5th of Elizabeth. But
a wheelwright, though he has never served an apprenticeship to a coach-
maker, may either himself make or employ journeyman to make coaches;
the trade of a coachmaker not being within the statute, because not ex-
ercised in England at the time when it was made. The manufactures of
Manchester, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, are many of them, upon
thisaccount,notwithinthestatute,nothavingbeenexercisedinEngland
beforethe5thofElizabeth.
302 [10] In France, the duration of apprenticeships is different in different
towns and in different trades. In Paris, five years is the term required G.ed.p138
in a great number; but before any person can be qualified to exercise the
trade as a master, he must, in many of them, serve five years more as
99 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a journeyman. During this latter term he is called the companion of his
master,andthetermitselfiscalledhiscompanionship.
303 [11] In Scotland there is no general law which regulates universally the
duration of apprenticeships. The term is different in different corpora-
tions. Where it is long, a part of it may generally be redeemed by paying
asmallfine. Inmosttowns,too,averysmallfineissufficienttopurchase
the freedom of any corporation. The weavers of linen and hempen cloth,
the principal manufactures of the country, as well as all other artificers
subservient to them, wheel-makers, reel-makers, etc., may exercise their
tradesinanytowncorporatewithoutpayinganyfine. Inalltownscorpor-
ate all persons are free to sell butcher’s meat upon any lawful day of the
week. Three years in Scotland is a common term of apprenticeship, even

this is done it is generally the effect of fraud, and not of inability; and
the longest apprenticeship can give no security against fraud. Quite dif-

308 [16] Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary. The arts, which are
much superior to common trades, such as those of making clocks and
watches, contain no such mystery as to require a long course of instruc-
tion. Thefirstinventionofsuchbeautifulmachines,indeed,andeventhat

petitionwouldreducetheprofitsofthemastersaswellasthewagesofthe

the public would be a gainer, the work of all artificers coming in this way

309 [17] It is to prevent this reduction of price, and consequently of wages and
profit,byrestrainingthatfreecompetitionwhichwouldmostcertainlyoc-
casion it, that all corporations, and the greater part of corporation laws,
have been established. In order to erect a corporation, no other author-
ity in ancient times was requisite in many parts of Europe, but that of
101 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the town corporate in which it was established. In England, indeed, a
charter from the king was likewise necessary. But this prerogative of the
crown seems to have been reserved rather for extorting money from the
subjectthanforthedefenceofthecommonlibertyagainstsuchoppressive
monopolies. Upon paying a fine to the king, the charter seems generally
to have been readily granted; and when any particular class of artificers G.ed.p141
or traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter, such
adulterineguilds,astheywerecalled,werenotalwaysdisfranchisedupon
that account, but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to
exercise their usurped privileges.2 The immediate inspection of all cor-
porations, and of the bye-laws which they might think proper to enact for
theirowngovernment,belongedtothetowncorporateinwhichtheywere
established; and whatever discipline was exercised over them proceeded
commonly, not from the king, but from the greater incorporation of which
thosesubordinateoneswereonlypartsormembers.
310 [18] The government of towns corporate was altogether in the hands of
traders and artificers, and it was the manifest interest of every particu-
lar class of them to prevent the market from being overstocked, as they
commonly express it, with their own particular species of industry, which
is in reality to keep it always understocked. Each class was eager to es-
tablishregulationsproperforthispurpose,and,provideditwasallowedto
doso,waswillingtoconsentthateveryotherclassshoulddothesame. In
consequenceofsuchregulations,indeed,eachclasswasobligedtobuythe
goods they had occasion for from every other within the town, somewhat
dearer than they otherwise might have done. But in recompense, they
were enabled to sell their own just as much dearer; so that so far it was
as broad as long, as they say; and in the dealings of the different classes
withinthetownwithoneanother,noneofthemwerelosersbytheseregu-
lations. Butintheirdealingswiththecountrytheywereallgreatgainers;
and in these latter dealings consists the whole trade which supports and
enricheseverytown.
311 [19] Every town draws its whole subsistence, and all the materials of its
industry, from the country. It pays for these chiefly in two ways: first, by
sendingbacktothecountryapartofthosematerialswroughtupandman-
ufactured;inwhichcasetheirpriceisaugmentedbythewagesofthework-
men,andtheprofitsoftheirmastersorimmediateemployers;secondly,by
sending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured produce, either of
other countries, or of distant parts of the same country, imported into the
town;inwhichcase,too,theoriginalpriceofthosegoodsisaugmentedby
the wages of the carriers or sailors, and by the profits of the merchants
who employ them. In what is gained upon the first of those two branches

that natural equality which would otherwise take place in the commerce
which is carried on between them. The whole annual produce of the la-
bour of the society is annually divided between those two different sets of
people. By means of those regulations a greater share of it is given to the
inhabitants of the town than would otherwise fall to them; and a less to
thoseofthecountry.

313 [21] That the industry which is carried on in towns is, everywhere in
Europe, more advantageous than that which is carried on in the coun-
try, without entering into any very nice computations, we may satisfy
ourselves by one very simple and obvious observation. In every country
of Europe we find, at least, a hundred people who have acquired great
fortunes from small beginnings by trade and manufactures, the industry
which properly belongs to towns, for one who has done so by that which
properlybelongstothecountry,theraisingofrudeproducebytheimprove-
mentandcultivationofland. Industry,therefore,mustbebetterrewarded,
the wages of labour and the profits of stock must evidently be greater in
the one situation than in the other. But stock and labour naturally seek
the most advantageous employment. They naturally, therefore, resort as
muchastheycantothetown,anddesertthecountry.
314 [22] The inhabitants of a town, being collected into one place, can easily
combine together. The most insignificant trades carried on in towns have
accordingly, in some place or other, been incorporated, and even where
theyhaveneverbeenincorporated,yetthecorporationspirit,thejealousy
ofstrangers,theaversiontotakeapprentices,ortocommunicatethesecret
of their trade, generally prevail in them, and often teach them, by volun-
tary associations and agreements, to prevent that free competition which
they cannot prohibit by bye-laws. The trades which employ but a small
number of hands run most easily into such combinations. Half a dozen G.ed.p143
wool-combers, perhaps, are necessary to keep a thousand spinners and
weavers at work. By combining not to take apprentices they can not only
engross the employment, but reduce the whole manufacture into a sort of
slaverytothemselves,andraisethepriceoftheirlabourmuchabovewhat

the very contemptible authors of some of them may sometimes affect to
speak of him. There is scarce any common mechanic trade, on the con-
trary, of which all the operations may not be as completely and distinctly
explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages, as it is possible for words
illustratedbyfigurestoexplainthem. Inthehistoryofthearts,nowpub-

explainedinthismanner. Thedirectionofoperations,besides,whichmust
be varied with every change of the weather, as well as with many other
accidents,requiresmuchmorejudgmentanddiscretionthanthatofthose
whicharealwaysthesameorverynearlythesame.
316 [24] Not only the art of the farmer, the general direction of the operations
of husbandry, but many inferior branches of country labour require much
more skin and experience than the greater part of mechanic trades. The

Butthemanwhoploughsthegroundwithateamofhorsesoroxen,works

tion. The common ploughman, though generally regarded as the pattern

more difficult to be understood by those who are not used to them. His
understanding,however,beingaccustomedtoconsideragreatervarietyof

andmanufacturers. Theywouldprobablybesoeverywhere,ifcorporation

317 [25] The superiority which the industry of the towns has everywhere in
Europe over that of the country is not altogether owing to corporations
andcorporationlaws. Itissupportedbymanyotherregulations. Thehigh
duties upon foreign manufactures and upon all goods imported by alien
merchants, all tend to the same purpose. Corporation laws enable the in-
habitants of towns to raise their prices, without fearing to be undersold
bythe freecompetitionoftheir owncountrymen. Thoseotherregulations
secure them equally against that of foreigners. The enhancement of price
occasioned by both is everywhere finally paid by the landlords, farmers,
andlabourersofthecountry,whohaveseldomopposedtheestablishment
ofsuchmonopolies. Theyhavecommonlyneitherinclinationnorfitnessto

the ancient profit in that species of industry which is peculiar to them.

320 [28] A regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular
town to enter their names and places of abode in a public register, facilit-
ates such assemblies. It connects individuals who might never otherwise
be known to one another, and gives every man of the trade a direction
wheretofindeveryothermanofit.
321 [29] A regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves
in order to provide for their poor, their sick, their widows and orphans,
by giving them a common interest to manage, renders such assemblies
necessary.

323 [31] Thepretencethatcorporationsarenecessaryforthebettergovernment G.ed.p146

weakens the force of this discipline. A particular set of workmen must

in many large incorporated towns no tolerable workmen are to be found,
even in some of the most necessary trades. If you would have your work
tolerably executed, it must be done in the suburbs, where the workmen,
having no exclusive privilege, have nothing but their character to depend
upon,andyoumustthensmuggleitintothetownaswellasyoucan.
324 [32] It is in this manner that the policy of Europe, by restraining the com-
petition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise

whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments

325 [33] Secondly, the policy of Europe, by increasing the competition in some
employments beyond what it naturally would be, occasions another in-
equality of an opposite kind in the whole of the advantages and disad-
vantagesofthedifferentemploymentsoflabourandstock.

ing to the contract which they may happen to make with their respective
superiors. Till after the middle of the fourteenth century, five merks, con-
taining about as much silver as ten pounds of our present money, was in G.ed.p147
England the usual pay of a curate or a stipendiary parish priest, as we
find it regulated by the decrees of several different national councils. At
thesameperiodfourpenceaday,containingthesamequantityofsilveras
ashillingofourpresentmoney,wasdeclaredtobethepayofamasterma-
son, and threepence a day, equal to ninepence of our present money, that
of a journeyman mason.3 The wages of both these labourers, therefore,
supposing them to have been constantly employed, were much superior
to those of the curate. The wages of the master mason, supposing him
to have been without employment one third of the year, would have fully
equalled them. By the 12th of Queen Anne, c. 12, it is declared, ‘That
whereasforwantofsufficientmaintenanceandencouragementtocurates,
thecureshaveinseveralplacesbeenmeanlysupplied,thebishopis,there-
fore,empoweredtoappointbywritingunderhisbandandsealasufficient
certain stipend or allowance, not exceeding fifty and not less than twenty
pounds a year.’ Forty pounds a year is reckoned at present very good pay
for a curate, and notwithstanding this Act of Parliament there are many
curacies under twenty pounds a year. There are journeymen shoemakers
in London who earn forty pounds a year, and there is scarce an industri-
ousworkmanofanykindinthatmetropoliswhodoesnotearnmorethan
twenty. This last sum indeed does not exceed what is frequently earned
by common labourers in many country parishes. Whenever the law has
attemptedtoregulatethewagesofworkmen,ithasalwaysbeenratherto
lower them than to raise them. But the law has upon many occasions at-
temptedtoraisethewagesofcurates,andforthedignityofthechurch,to
oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched main-
tenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of. And in both

107 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
casesthelawseemstohavebeenequallyineffectual,andhasnevereither
been able to raise the wages of curates, or to sink those of labourers to
the degree that was intended; because it has never been able to hinder
eithertheonefrombeingwillingtoacceptoflessthanthelegalallowance,
on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their
competitors; or the other from receiving more, on account of the contrary
competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from
employingthem.
327 [35] The great benefices and other ecclesiastical dignities support the hon- G.ed.p148
our of the church, notwithstanding the mean circumstance of some of its
inferior members. The respect paid to the profession, too, makes some
compensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary recom-
pense. In England, and in all Roman Catholic countries, the lottery of
the church is in reality much more advantageous than is necessary. The
exampleofthechurchesofScotland,ofGeneva,andofseveralotherProt-
estantchurches,maysatisfyusthatinsocreditableaprofession,inwhich
education is so easily procured, the hopes of much more moderate bene-
ficeswilldrawasufficientnumberoflearned,decent,andrespectablemen
intoholyorders.
328 [36] Inprofessionsinwhichtherearenobenefices,suchaslawandphysic,
if an equal proportion of people were educated at the public expense, the
competition would soon be so great as to sink very much their pecuniary
reward. It might then not be worth any man’s while to educate his son
to either of those professions at his own expense. They would be entirely
abandoned to such as had been educated by those public charities, whose
numbers and necessities would oblige them in general to content them-
selves with a very miserable recompense, to the entire degradation of the
nowrespectableprofessionsoflawandphysic.
329 [37] That unprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters are
prettymuchinthesituationwhichlawyersandphysiciansprobablywould
be in upon the foregoing supposition. In every part of Europe the greater
part of them have been educated for the church, but have been hindered
by different reasons from entering into holy orders. They have generally,
therefore, been educated at the public expense, and their numbers are
everywhere so great as commonly to reduce the price of their labour to
averypaltryrecompense.
330 [38] Before the invention of the art of printing, the only employment by
which a man of letters could make anything by his talents was that of a
public or private teacher, or by communicating to other people the curi-
ousandusefulknowledgewhichhehadacquiredhimself: andthisisstill
surelyamorehonourable,amoreuseful,andingeneralevenamoreprof-
itable employment than that other of writing for a bookseller, to which
the art of printing has given occasion. The time and study, the genius,
knowledge, and application requisite to qualify an eminent teacher of the
sciences, are at least equal to what is necessary for the greatest practi- G.ed.p149
108 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tioners in law and physic. But the usual reward of the eminent teacher
bearsnoproportiontothatofthelawyerorphysician;becausethetradeof
theoneiscrowdedwithindigentpeoplewhohavebeenbroughtuptoitat

veryfewwhohavenotbeeneducatedattheirown. Theusualrecompense,
however,ofpublicandprivateteachers,smallasitmayappear,wouldun-
doubtedly be less than it is, if the competition of those yet more indigent
men of letters who write for bread was not taken out of the market. Be-
fore the invention of the art of printing, a scholar and a beggar seem to
have been terms very nearly synonymous. The different governors of the
universitiesbeforethattimeappeartohaveoftengrantedlicencestotheir
scholarstobeg.
331 [39] Inancienttimes,beforeanycharitiesofthiskindhadbeenestablished
fortheeducationofindigentpeopletothelearnedprofessions,therewards
of eminent teachers appear to have been much more considerable. Iso-
crates,inwhatiscalledhisdiscourseagainstthesophists,reproachesthe
teachers of his own times with inconsistency. ‘They make the most mag-
nificentpromisestotheirscholars,’ sayshe, ‘andundertaketoteachthem
to be wise, to be happy, and to be just, and in return for so important a
service they stipulate the paltry reward of four or five minae. They who
teach wisdom,’ continues he, ‘ought certainly to be wise themselves; but
if any man were to sell such a bargain for such a price, he would be con-
victed of the most evident folly.’ He certainly does not mean here to ex-
aggerate the reward, and we may be assured that it was not less than
he represents it. Four minae were equal to thirteen pounds six shillings
and eightpence: five minae to sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and four-
pence. Something not less than the largest of those two sums, therefore,
mustatthattimehavebeenusuallypaidtothemosteminentteachersat
Athens. Isocrateshimselfdemandedtenminae,orthirty-threepoundssix G.ed.p150
shillings and eightpence, from each scholar. When he taught at Athens,
he is said to have had a hundred scholars. I understand this to be the
number whom he taught at one time, or who attended what we could call
onecourseoflectures,anumberwhichwillnotappearextraordinaryfrom
so great a city to so famous a teacher, who taught, too, what was at that
time the most fashionable of all sciences, rhetoric. He must have made,
therefore,byeachcourseoflectures,athousandminae,or3,333l.6s.8d. A
thousandminae,accordingly,issaidbyPlutarchinanotherplace,tohave

ers in those times appear to have acquired great fortunes. Gorgias made
apresenttothetempleofDelphiofhisownstatueinsolidgold. Wemust
not, I presume, suppose that it was as large as the life. His way of living,
as well as that of Hippias and Protagoras, two other eminent teachers of
thosetimes,isrepresentedbyPlatoassplendideventoostentation. Plato
himself is said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence. Aristotle,
afterhavingbeentutortoAlexander,andmostmunificentlyrewarded,as
109 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
itisuniversallyagreed,bothbyhimandhisfatherPhilip,thoughtitworth
while,notwithstanding,toreturntoAthens,inordertoresumetheteach-
ing of his school. Teachers of the sciences were probably in those times
less common than they came to be in an age or two afterwards, when the
competitionhadprobablysomewhatreducedboththepriceoftheirlabour
andtheadmirationfortheirpersons. Themosteminentofthem,however,
appear always to have enjoyed a degree of consideration much superior
to any of the like profession in the present times. The Athenians sent

332 [40] This inequality is upon the whole, perhaps, rather advantageous than G.ed.p151
hurtful to the public. It may somewhat degrade the profession of a public
teacher; but the cheapness of literary education is surely an advantage
which greatly overbalances this trifling inconveniency. The public, too,
mightderivestillgreaterbenefitfromit,iftheconstitutionofthoseschools
and colleges, in which education is carried on, was more reasonable than
itisatpresentthroughthegreaterpartofEurope.
333 [41] Thirdly, the policy of Europe, by obstructing the free circulation of la-
bour and stock both from employment to employment, and from place to
place, occasions in some cases a very incovenient inequality in the whole
oftheadvantagesanddisadvantagesoftheirdifferentemployments.
334 [42] The Statute of Apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labour
from one employment to another, even in the same place. The exclusive
privilegesofcorporationsobstructitfromoneplacetoanother,eveninthe
sameemployment.
335 [43] It frequently happens that while high wages are given to the work-
men in one manufacture, those in another are obliged to content them-
selves with bare subsistence. The one is in an advancing state, and has,
therefore, a continual demand for new bands: the other is in a declining
state, and the superabundance of hands is continually increasing. Those
twomanufacturesmaysometimesbeinthesametown,andsometimesin
the same neighbourhood, without being able to lend the least assistance
to one another. The Statute of Apprenticeship may oppose it in the one
case, and both that and an exclusive corporation in the other. In many
different manufactures, however, the operations are so much alike, that
theworkmencouldeasilychangetradeswithoneanother,ifthoseabsurd
laws did not hinder them. The arts of weaving plain linen and plain silk,
for example, are almost entirely the same. That of weaving plain woollen
is somewhat different; but the difference is so insignificant that either a
linen or a silk weaver might become a tolerable work in a very few days.
If any of those three capital manufactures, therefore, were decaying, the
110 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
workmenmightfindaresourceinoneoftheothertwowhichwasinamore G.ed.p152
prosperous condition; and their wages would neither rise too high in the
thriving, nor sink too low in the decaying manufacture. The linen manu-
facture indeed is, in England, by a particular statute, open to everybody;
but as it is not much cultivated through the greater part of the country,
it can afford no general resource to the workmen of other decaying man-
ufactures, who, wherever the Statute of Apprenticeship takes place, have
nootherchoicebuteithertocomeupontheparish, ortoworkascommon
labourers, for which, by their habits, they are much worse qualified than

thecharityofthosereligioushouses,aftersomeotherineffectualattempts
fortheirrelief,itwasenactedbythe43rdofElizabeth,c.2thateverypar-

339 [47] Bythisstatutethenecessityofprovidingfortheirownpoorwasindis-
pensably imposed upon every parish. Who were to be considered as the
poorofeachparishbecame,therefore,aquestionofsomeimportance. This
question, after some variation, was at last determined by the 13th and
14th of Charles II when it was enacted, that forty days’ undisturbed res-
idenceshouldgainanypersonasettlementinanyparish;butthatwithin
thattimeitshouldbelawfulfortwojusticesofthepeace, uponcomplaint

It was enacted, therefore, by the 1st of James II that the forty days’ un-
disturbed residence of any person necessary to gain a settlement should
be accounted only from the time of his delivering notice in writing, of the
place of his abode and the number of his family, to one of the churchwar-
densoroverseersoftheparishwherehecametodwell.
341 [49] But parish officers, it seems, were not always more honest with re-
gard to their own, than they had been with regard to other parishes, and
sometimes connived at such intrusions, receiving the notice, and taking
no proper steps in consequence of it. As every person in a parish, there-
fore,wassupposedtohaveaninteresttopreventasmuchaspossibletheir
beingburdenedbysuchintruders,itwasfurtherenactedbythe3rdofWil-
liam III that the forty days’ residence should be accounted only from the
publicationofsuchnoticeinwritingonSundayinthechurch,immediately
afterdivineservice.
342 [50] ‘After all,’ says Doctor Burn, ‘this kind of settlement, by continuing
forty days after publication of notice in writing, is very seldom obtained;
andthedesignoftheactsisnotsomuchforgainingofsettlements,asfor
the avoiding of them, by persons coming into a parish clandestinely: for
thegivingofnoticeisonlyputtingaforceupontheparishtoremove. But
if a person’s situation is such, that it is doubtful whether he is actually
removable or not, he shall by giving of notice compel the parish either to
allow him a settlement uncontested, by suffering him to continue forty G.ed.p154
days;or,byremovinghim,totrytheright.’
343 [51] Thisstatute,therefore,rendereditalmostimpracticableforapoorman

eitherbytaxinghimtoparishrates,orbyelectinghimintoaparishoffice.
345 [53] No married man can well gain any settlement in either of the two last
ways. An apprentice is scarce ever married; and it is expressly enacted
112 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
that no married servant shall gain any settlement by being hired for a
year. Theprincipaleffectofintroducingsettlementbyservicehasbeento
putoutinagreatmeasuretheoldfashionofhiringforayear,whichbefore
had been so customary in England, that even at this day, if no particular
termisagreedupon,thelawintendsthateveryservantishiredforayear.
But masters are not always willing to give their servants a settlement by
hiring them in this manner; and servants are not always willing to be so
hired, because, as every last settlement discharges all the foregoing, they

346 [54] No independent workman, it is evident, whether labourer or artificer,

Whensuchaperson,therefore,carriedhisindustrytoanewparish,hewas
liabletoberemoved,howhealthyandindustrioussoever,atthecapriceof
any churchwarden or overseer, unless he either rented a tenement of ten
pounds a year, a thing impossible for one who has nothing but his labour
to live by; or could give such security for the discharge of the parish as
twojusticesofthepeaceshouldjudgesufficient. Whatsecuritytheyshall
require, indeed, is left altogether to their discretion; but they cannot well
require less than thirty pounds, it having been enacted that the purchase
even of a freehold estate of less than thirty pounds’ value shall not gain G.ed.p155
any person a settlement, as not being sufficient for the discharge of the
parish. But this is a security which scarce any man who lives by labour
cangive;andmuchgreatersecurityisfrequentlydemanded.
347 [55] Inordertorestoreinsomemeasurethatfreecirculationoflabourwhich
those different statutes had almost entirely taken away, the invention of
certificates was fallen upon. By the 8th and 9th of William III it was en-
actedthatifanypersonshouldbringacertificatefromtheparishwherehe
waslastlegallysettled,subscribedbythechurchwardensandoverseersof
thepoor, andallowedbytwojusticesofthepeace, thateveryotherparish
should be obliged to receive him; that he should not be removable merely
upon account of his being likely to become chargeable, but only upon his
becomingactuallychargeable,andthatthentheparishwhichgrantedthe
certificate should be obliged to pay the expense both of his maintenance
and of his removal. And in order to give the most perfect security to the
parish where such certificated man should come to reside, it was further
enacted by the same statute that he should gain no settlement there by
any means whatever, except either by renting a tenement of ten pounds
a year, or by serving upon his own account in an annual parish office for
onewholeyear;andconsequentlyneitherbynotice,norbyservice,norby
apprenticeship, nor by paying parish rates. By the 12th of Queen Anne,
too, stat. 1, c.18, it was further enacted that neither the servants nor ap-
prenticesofsuchcertificatedmanshouldgainanysettlementintheparish
whereheresidedundersuchcertificate.
348 [56] Howfarthisinventionhasrestoredthatfreecirculationoflabourwhich
113 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
theprecedingstatuteshadalmostentirelytakenaway,wemaylearnfrom
the following very judicious observation of Doctor Burn. ‘It is obvious,’
says he, ‘that there are divers good reasons for requiring certificates with
personscomingtosettleinanyplace;namely,thatpersonsresidingunder
themcangainnosettlement,neitherbyapprenticeship,norbyservice,nor
by giving notice, nor by paying parish rates; that they can settle neither
apprentices nor servants; that if they become chargeable, it is certainly
known whither to remove them, and the parish shall be paid for the re-
moval, and for their maintenance in the meantime; and that if they fall
sick, and cannot be removed, the parish which gave the certificate must
maintain them: none of all which can be without a certificate. Which
reasons will hold proportionably for parishes not granting certificates in G.ed.p156
ordinary cases; for it is far more than an equal chance, but that they will
havethecertificatedpersonsagain,andinaworsecondition.’ Themoralof
this observation seems to be that certificates ought always to be required
by the parish where any poor man comes to reside, and that they ought
very seldom to be granted by that which he proposes to leave. ‘There is
somewhatofhardshipinthismatterofcertificates,’saysthesameveryin-
telligentauthorinhisHistoryofthePoorLaws,‘byputtingitinthepower
of a parish officer to imprison a man as it were for life; however incon-
venient it may be for him to continue at that place where he has had the
misfortune to acquire what is called a settlement, or whatever advantage
hemayproposetohimselfbylivingelsewhere’.
349 [57] Though a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good beha-
viour, and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish to
whichhereallydoesbelong,itisaltogetherdiscretionaryintheparishof-
ficerseithertograntortorefuseit. Amandamuswasoncemovedfor,says
Doctor Burn, to compel the churchwardens and overseers to sign a certi-
ficate; butthecourtofKing’sBenchrejectedthemotionasaverystrange
attempt.
350 [58] The very unequal price of labour which we frequently find in England
inplacesatnogreatdistancefromoneanotherisprobablyowingtotheob-
structionwhichthelawofsettlementsgivestoapoormanwhowouldcarry
hisindustryfromoneparishtoanotherwithoutacertificate. Asingleman,
indeed, who is healthy and industrious, may sometimes reside by suffer-
ance without one; but a man with a wife and family who should attempt
todosowouldinmostparishesbesureofbeingremoved,andifthesingle
man should afterwards marry, he would generally be removed likewise.
The scarcity of hands in one parish, therefore, cannot always be relieved
bytheirsuperabundanceinanother,asitisconstantlyinScotland,and,I
believe,inallothercountrieswherethereisnodifficultyofsettlement. In
suchcountries,thoughwagesmaysometimesrisealittleintheneighbour-
hoodofagreattown,orwhereverelsethereisanextraordinarydemandfor

351 [59] To remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour from the par-
ish where he chooses to reside is an evident violation of natural liberty
and justice. The common people of England, however, so jealous of their
liberty, but like the common people of most other countries never rightly
understanding wherein it consists, have now for more than a century to-
gethersufferedthemselvestobeexposedtothisoppressionwithoutarem-
edy. Thoughmenofreflection, too, havesometimescomplainedofthelaw

general popular clamour, such as that against general warrants, an abus-
ive practice undoubtedly, but such a one as was not likely to occasion any
general oppression. There is scarce a poor man in England of forty years
ofage,Iwillventuretosay,whohasnotinsomepartofhislifefelthimself
mostcruellyoppressedbythisill-contrivedlawofsettlements.
352 [60] Ishallconcludethislongchapterwithobservingthat,thoughanciently
it was usual to rate wages, first by general laws extending over the whole
kingdom, and afterwards by particular orders of the justices of peace in
every particular county, both these practices have now gone entirely into
disuse. ‘Bytheexperienceofabovefourhundredyears,’saysDoctorBurn,
‘itseemstimetolayasideallendeavourstobringunderstrictregulations,
what in its own nature seems incapable of minute limitation; for if all
personsinthesamekindofworkweretoreceiveequalwages,therewould
benoemulation,andnoroomleftforindustryoringenuity’.
353 [61] Particularactsofparliament, however, stillattemptsometimestoreg-
ulate wages in particular trades and in particular places. Thus the 8th of
George III prohibits under heavy penalties all master tailors in London,
and five miles round it, from giving, and their workmen from accepting,
more than two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a day, except in the
case of a general mourning. Whenever the legislature attempts to regu-
late the differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors
arealwaysthemasters. Whentheregulation,therefore,isinfavourofthe G.ed.p158
workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise
wheninfavourofthemasters. Thusthelawwhichobligesthemastersin
several different trades to pay their workmen in money and not in goods
isquitejustandequitable. Itimposesnorealhardshipuponthemasters.
It only obliges them to pay that value in money, which they pretended to
pay, but did not always really pay, in goods. This law is in favour of the
workmen: butthe8thofGeorgeIIIisinfavourofthemasters. Whenmas-
terscombinetogetherinordertoreducethewagesoftheirworkmen,they
commonly enter into a private bond or agreement not to give more than
a certain wage under a certain penalty. Were the workmen to enter into
115 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a contrary combination of the same kind, not to accept of a certain wage
under a certain penalty, the law would punish them very severely; and if
it dealt impartially, it would treat the masters in the same manner. But
the 8th of George III enforces by law that very regulation which masters
sometimes attempt to establish by such combinations. The complaint of
theworkmen, thatitputstheablestandmostindustriousuponthesame
footingwithanordinaryworkman,seemsperfectlywellfounded.
354 [62] In ancient times, too, it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of
merchants and other dealers, by rating the price both of provisions and
other goods. The assize of bread is, so far as I know, the only remnant
ofthisancientusage. Wherethereisanexclusivecorporation,itmayper-
hapsbepropertoregulatethepriceofthefirstnecessaryoflife. Butwhere
thereisnone,thecompetitionwillregulateitmuchbetterthananyassize.

ment of one, in the few places where it has yet taken place, has produced
no sensible advantage. In the greater part of the towns of Scotland, how-
ever, there is an incorporation of bakers who claim exclusive privileges,
thoughtheyarenotverystrictlyguarded.
355 [63] The proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit
in the different employments of labour and stock, seems not to be much G.ed.p159
affected, as has already been observed, by the riches or poverty, the ad-
vancing, stationary, or declining state of the society. Such revolutions in

116 CHAPTER XI
G.ed.p160
OF THE RENT OF LAND
356 [1] RENT, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally the
highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances
of the land. In adjusting the terms of the lease, the landlord endeavours
to leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to
keep up the stock from which he furnishes the seed, pays the labour, and
purchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry,
together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood.
This is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content
himself without being a loser, and the landlord seldom means to leave
him any more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the same thing,
whatever part of its price is over and above this share, he naturally en-
deavours to reserve to himself as the rent of his land, which is evidently
thehighestthetenantcanaffordtopayintheactualcircumstancesofthe
land. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more frequently the ignorance, of
the landlord, makes him accept of somewhat less than this portion; and
sometimestoo,thoughmorerarely,theignoranceofthetenantmakeshim
undertake to pay somewhat more, or to content himself with somewhat
lessthantheordinaryprofitsoffarmingstockintheneighbourhood. This
portion,however,maystillbeconsideredasthenaturalrentofland,orthe
rent for which it is naturally meant that land should for the most part be
let.
357 [2] Therentofland,itmaybethought,isfrequentlynomorethanareas-
onable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its
improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occa-
sions; for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case. The landlord
demands a rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or
profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this
original rent. Those improvements, besides, are not always made by the
stockofthelandlord,butsometimesbythatofthetenant. Whenthelease

It grows in several parts of Great Britain, particularly in Scotland, upon
such rocks only as lie within the high water mark, which are twice every
day covered with the sea, and of which the produce, therefore, was never
augmented by human industry. The landlord, however, whose estate is
boundedbyakelpshoreofthiskind,demandsarentforitasmuchasfor
hiscornfields.
359 [4] The sea in the neighbourhood of the islands of Shetland is more than
commonly abundant in fish, which makes a great part of the subsistence
of their inhabitants. But in order to profit by the produce of the water,
they must have a habitation upon the neighbouring land. The rent of the
landlordisinproportion,nottowhatthefarmercanmakebytheland,but
to what he can make both by the land and by the water. It is partly paid
in sea-fish; and one of the very few instances in which rent makes a part
ofthepriceofthatcommodityistobefoundinthatcountry.
360 [5] Therentoftheland,therefore,consideredasthepricepaidfortheuse

whatthelandlordmayhavelaidoutupontheimprovementoftheland,or

rent to the landlord. The latter sometimes may, and sometimes may not,
accordingtodifferentcircumstances.

364 [9] Theparticularconsideration,first,ofthosepartsoftheproduceofland
which always afford some rent; secondly, of those which sometimes may
and sometimes may not afford rent; and, thirdly, of the variations which,
in the different periods of improvement, naturally take place in the rel-
ative value of those two different sorts of rude produce, when compared
118 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
both with one another and with manufactured commodities, will divide
thischapterintothreeparts.
PART I
Of the Produce of Land which always affords
Rent
365 [1] As men, like all other animals, naturally multiply in proportion to the
means of their subsistence, food is always, more or less, in demand. It
can always purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity of labour,
andsomebodycanalwaysbefoundwhoiswillingtodosomethinginorder
to obtain it. The quantity of labour, indeed, which it can purchase is not
alwaysequaltowhatitcouldmaintain,ifmanagedinthemosteconomical
manner,onaccountofthehighwageswhicharesometimesgiventolabour.
But it can always purchase such a quantity of labour as it can maintain,
according to the rate at which the sort of labour is commonly maintained
intheneighbourhood.
366 [2] But land, in almost any situation, produces a greater quantity of food
thanwhatissufficienttomaintainallthelabournecessaryforbringingit G.ed.p163
tomarketinthemostliberalwayinwhichthatlabourisevermaintained.
Thesurplus,too,isalwaysmorethansufficienttoreplacethestockwhich
employed that labour, together with its profits. Something, therefore, al-
waysremainsforarenttothelandlord.
367 [3] The most desert moors in Norway and Scotland produce some sort of
pasture for cattle, of which the milk and the increase are always more
than sufficient, not only to maintain all the labour necessary for tending
them, and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or owner of the herd
or flock; but to afford some small rent to the landlord. The rent increases
in proportion to the goodness of the pasture. The same extent of ground
not only maintains a greater number of cattle, but as they are brought
withinasmallercompass,lesslabourbecomesrequisitetotendthem,and
to collect their produce. The landlord gains both ways, by the increase of
theproduceandbythediminutionofthelabourwhichmustbemaintained
outofit.
368 [4] The rent of land not only varies with its fertility, whatever be its pro-
duce, but with its situation, whatever be its fertility. Land in the neigh-
bourhood of a town gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in a dis-
tant part of the country. Though it may cost no more labour to cultivate
the one than the other, it must always cost more to bring the produce of
thedistantlandtomarket. Agreaterquantityoflabour,therefore,mustbe
maintainedoutofit;andthesurplus,fromwhicharedrawnboththeprofit
ofthefarmerandtherentofthelandlord,mustbediminished. Butinre-
119 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
mote parts of the country the rate of profits, as has already been shown,
is generally higher than in the neighbourhood of a large town. A smaller
proportion of this diminished surplus, therefore, must belong to the land-
lord.
369 [5] Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense
of carriage, put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level
with those in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon that account
the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the
remote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country.
Theyareadvantageoustothetown,bybreakingdownthemonopolyofthe
countryinitsneighbourhood. Theyareadvantageouseventothatpartof
the country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old
market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly, besides,
isagreatenemytogoodmanagement,whichcanneverbeuniversallyes- G.ed.p164
tablishedbutinconsequenceofthatfreeanduniversalcompetitionwhich
forceseverybodytohaverecoursetoitforthesakeofself-defence. Itisnot
more than fifty years ago that some of the counties in the neighbourhood
ofLondonpetitionedtheParliamentagainsttheextensionoftheturnpike
roads into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pretended,
from the cheapness of labour, would be able to sell their grass and corn
cheaperintheLondonmarketthanthemselves,andwouldtherebyreduce
their rents, and ruin their cultivation. Their rents, however, have risen,
andtheircultivationhasbeenimprovedsincethattime.
370 [6] A cornfield of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of
foodformanthanthebestpastureofequalextent. Thoughitscultivation
requiresmuchmorelabour,yetthesurpluswhichremainsafterreplacing
the seed and maintaining all that labour, is likewise much greater. If a
pound of butcher’s meat, therefore, was never supposed to be worth more
thanapoundofbread,thisgreatersurpluswouldeverywherebeofgreater
value, and constitute a greater fund both for the profit of the farmer and
the rent of the landlord. It seems to have done so universally in the rude
beginningsofagriculture.
371 [7] Buttherelativevaluesofthosetwodifferentspeciesoffood,breadand
butcher’s meat, are very different in the different periods of agriculture.
In its rude beginnings, the unimproved wilds, which then occupy the far
greater part of the country, are all abandoned to cattle. There is more
butcher’smeatthanbread,andbread,therefore,isthefoodforwhichthere
is the greatest competition, and which consequently brings the greatest
price. At Buenos Ayres, we are told by Ulloa, four reals, one-and-twenty
pence halfpenny sterling, was, forty or fifty years ago, the ordinary price
of an ox, chosen from a herd of two or three hundred. He says nothing of
the price of bread, probably because he found nothing remarkable about
it. An ox there, he says, cost little more than the labour of catching him.
But corn can nowhere be raised without a great deal of labour, and in a
country which lies upon the river Plate, at that time the direct road from
120 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
EuropetothesilverminesofPotosi,themoneypriceoflabourcouldnotbe
very cheap. It is otherwise when cultivation is extended over the greater
part of the country. There is then more bread than butcher’s meat. The
competitionchangesitsdirection,andthepriceofbutcher’smeatbecomes
greaterthanthepriceofbread.
372 [8] By the extension besides of cultivation, the unimproved wilds become G.ed.p165
insufficient to supply the demand for butcher’s meat. A great part of the
cultivatedlandsmustbeemployedinrearingandfatteningcattle,ofwhich
theprice,therefore,mustbesufficienttopay,notonlythelabournecessary
fortendingthem,buttherentwhichthelandlordandtheprofitwhichthe
farmer could have drawn from such land employed in tillage. The cattle
bred upon the most uncultivated moors, when brought to the same mar-
ket, are, in proportion to their weight or goodness, sold at the same price
as those which are reared upon the most improved land. The proprietors
of those moors profit by it, and raise the rent of their land in proportion
tothepriceoftheircattle. Itisnotmorethanacenturyagothatinmany
partsofthehighlandsofScotland,butcher’smeatwasascheaporcheaper
than even bread made of oatmeal. The union opened the market of Eng-
landtothehighlandcattle. Theirordinarypriceisatpresentaboutthree

almosteverypartofGreatBritainapoundofthebestbutcher’smeatis,in

373 [9] It is thus that in the progress of improvement the rent and profit of
unimprovedpasturecometoberegulatedinsomemeasurebytherentand
profit of what is improved, and these again by the rent and profit of corn.
Cornisanannualcrop. Butcher’smeat,acropwhichrequiresfourorfive
years to grow. As an acre of land, therefore, will produce a much smaller
quantity of the one species of food than of the other, the inferiority of the
quantity must be compensated by the superiority of the price. If it was
morethancompensated,morecornlandwouldbeturnedintopasture;and
if it was not compensated, part of what was in pasture would be brought
backintocorn.
374 [10] This equality, however, between the rent and profit of grass and those
ofcorn;ofthelandofwhichtheimmediateproduceisfoodforcattle,andof
that of which the immediate produce is food for men; must be understood
totakeplaceonlythroughthegreaterpartoftheimprovedlandsofagreat
country. In some particular local situations it is quite otherwise, and the
rentandprofitofgrassaremuchsuperiortowhatcanbemadebycorn.
375 [11] Thus in the neighbourhood of a great town the demand for milk and
for forage to horses frequently contribute, together with the high price of
butcher’smeat,toraisethevalueofgrassabovewhatmaybecalleditsnat- G.ed.p166
ural proportion to that of corn. This local advantage, it is evident, cannot
becommunicatedtothelandsatadistance.
121 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
376 [12] Particular circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so
populousthatthewholeterritory,likethelandsintheneighbourhoodofa
greattown,hasnotbeensufficienttoproduceboththegrassandthecorn
necessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants. Their lands, therefore,
havebeenprincipallyemployedintheproductionofgrass,themorebulky

andcorn,thefoodofthegreatbodyofthepeople,hasbeenchieflyimported
from foreign countries. Holland is at present in this situation, and a con-
siderablepartofancientItalyseemstohavebeensoduringtheprosperity
of the Romans. To feed well, old Cato said, as we are told by Cicero, was
thefirstandmostprofitablethinginthemanagementofaprivateestate;
to feed tolerably well, the second; and to feed ill, the third. To plough,
he ranked only in the fourth place of profit and advantage. Tillage, in-
deed,inthatpartofancientItalywhichlayintheneighbourhoodofRome,
musthavebeenverymuchdiscouragedbythedistributionsofcornwhich
were frequently made to the people, either gratuitously, or at a very low
price. This corn was brought from the conquered provinces, of which sev-
eral,insteadoftaxes,wereobligedtofurnishatenthpartoftheirproduce
at a stated price, about sixpence a peck, to the republic. The low price at
which this corn was distributed to the people must necessarily have sunk
the price of what could be brought to the Roman market from Latium, or
the ancient territory of Rome, and must have discouraged its cultivation
inthatcountry.
377 [13] In an open country too, of which the principal produce is corn, a well-
enclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn field in
its neighbourhood. It is convenient for the maintenance of the cattle em- G.ed.p167
ployed in the cultivation of the corn, and its high rent is, in this case, not
soproperlypaidfromthevalueofitsownproduceasfromthatofthecorn
lands which are cultivated by means of it. It is likely to fall, if ever the
neighbouring lands are completely enclosed. The present high rent of en-
closed land in Scotland seems owing to the scarcity of enclosure, and will
probably last no longer than that scarcity. The advantage of enclosure
is greater for pasture than for corn. It saves the labour of guarding the
cattle, which feed better, too, when they are not liable to be disturbed by
theirkeeperorhisdog.
378 [14] But where there is no local advantage of this kind, the rent and profit
ofcorn,orwhateverelseisthecommonvegetablefoodorthepeople,must
naturallyregulate,uponthelandwhichisfitforproducingit,therentand
profitofpasture.
379 [15] The use of the artificial grasses, of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the
other expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quant-
ity of land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass,
should somewhat reduce, it might be expected, the superiority which, in
animprovedcountry,thepriceofbutcher’smeatnaturallyhasoverthatof
bread. It seems accordingly to have done so; and there is some reason for
122 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
believing that, at least in the London market, the price of butcher’s meat
inproportiontothepriceofbreadisagooddeallowerinthepresenttimes
thanitwasinthebeginningofthelastcentury.
380 [16] In the appendix to the Life of prince Henry, Doctor Birch has given us
anaccountofthepricesofbutcher’smeatascommonlypaidbythatprince.
Itistheresaidthatthefourquartersofanoxweighingsixhundredpounds

one shillings and eightpence per hundred pounds weight. Prince Henry
diedonthe6thofNovember1612,inthenineteenthyearofhisage.
381 [17] In March 1764, there was a Parliamentary inquiry into the causes of
the high price of provisions at that time. It was then, among other proof G.ed.p168
to the same purpose, given in evidence by a Virginia merchant, that in
March1763,hehadvictualledhisshipsfortwenty-fourortwenty-fiveshil-

whereas,inthatdearyear,hehadpaidtwenty-sevenshillingsforthesame

eightpence cheaper than the ordinary price paid by Prince Henry; and it
isthebestbeefonly,itmustbeobserved,whichisfittobesaltedforthose

The price paid by prince Henry amounts to 33thd. per pound weight

sort of pieces had usually been sold in the month of March. But even this
high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can well suppose the

385 [21] But in the twelve years preceding 1764, including that year, the aver-
age price of the same measure of the best wheat at the same market was
2l.1s.91d.

386 [22] In the twelve first years of the last century, therefore, wheat appears
to have been a good deal cheaper, and butcher’s meat a good deal dearer,
thaninthetwelveyearspreceding1764,includingthatyear.
387 [23] In all great countries the greater part of the cultivated lands are em-
ployed in producing either food for men or food for cattle. The rent and
profit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land. If
any particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be turned into
cornorpasture;andifanyaffordedmore,somepartofthelandsincornor
pasturewouldsoonbeturnedtothatproduce.

the other a greater profit than corn or pasture. This superiority, however,

389 [25] In a hop garden, a fruit garden, a kitchen garden, both the rent of the
landlord,andtheprofitofthefarmer,aregenerallygreaterthaninacorn
or grass field. But to bring the ground into this condition requires more
expense. Henceagreaterrentbecomesduetothelandlord. Itrequires,too,
amoreattentiveandskilfulmanagement. Henceagreaterprofitbecomes
duetothefarmer. Thecroptoo,atleastinthehopandfruitgarden,ismore
precarious. Itsprice,therefore,besidescompensatingalloccasionallosses,
must afford something like the profit of insurance. The circumstances of
gardeners,generallymean,andalwaysmoderate,maysatisfyusthattheir
greatingenuityisnotcommonlyover-recompensed. Theirdelightfulartis
practised by so many rich people for amusement, that little advantage is
to be made by those who practise it for profit; because the persons who
should naturally be their best customers supply themselves with all their
mostpreciousproductions.
390 [26] The advantage which the landlord derives from such improvements
seems at no time to have been greater than what was sufficient to com-
pensate the original expense of making them. In the ancient husbandry,
afterthevineyard, awell-wateredkitchengardenseemstohavebeenthe
part of the farm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce.
But Democritus, who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years
ago,andwhowasregardedbytheancientsasoneofthefathersoftheart,
thoughttheydidnotactwiselywhoenclosedakitchengarden. Theprofit,
hesaid, wouldnotcompensatetheexpenseofastonewall; andbricks(he
meant, I suppose, bricks baked in the sun) mouldered with the rain, and
the winter storm, and required continual repairs. Columella, who reports
this judgment of Democritus, does not controvert it, but proposes a very
frugal method of enclosing with a hedge of brambles and briars, which,
he says, he had found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenet-
rable fence; but which, it seems, was not commonly known in the time of
Democritus. Palladius adopts the opinion of Columella, which had before G.ed.p170
beenrecommendedbyVarro. Inthejudgmentofthoseancientimprovers,
the produce of a kitchen garden had, it seems, been little more than suf-
ficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expense of watering; for
in countries so near the sun, it was thought proper, in those times as in
the present, to have the command of a stream of water which could be
conductedtoeverybedinthegarden. ThroughthegreaterpartofEurope
a kitchen garden is not at present supposed to deserve a better enclosure
than that recommended by Columella. In Great Britain, and some other
northerncountries, thefinerfruitscannotbe broughttoperfectionbutby
124 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the assistance of a wall. Their price, therefore, in such countries must be
sufficienttopaytheexpenseofbuildingandmaintainingwhattheycannot
be had without. The fruit-wall frequently surrounds the kitchen garden,
whichthusenjoysthebenefitofanenclosurewhichitsownproducecould
seldompayfor.
391 [27] That the vineyard, when properly planted and brought to perfection,
wasthemostvaluablepartofthefarm,seemstohavebeenanundoubted
maxim in the ancient agriculture, as it is in the modern through all the
winecountries. Butwhetheritwasadvantageoustoplantanewvineyard
was a matter of dispute among the ancient Italian husbandmen, as we
learn from Columella. He decides, like a true lover of all curious cultiva-
tion, in favour of the vineyard, and endeavours to show, by a comparison
of the profit and expense, that it was a most advantageous improvement.
Suchcomparisons,however,betweentheprofitandexpenseofnewprojects
arecommonlyveryfallacious,andinnothingmoresothaninagriculture.
Hadthegainactuallymadebysuchplantationsbeencommonlyasgreatas

Thesamepointisfrequentlyatthisdayamatterofcontroversyinthewine
countries. Their writers on agriculture, indeed, the lovers and promoters
of high cultivation, seem generally disposed to decide with Columella in
favour of the vineyard. In France the anxiety of the proprietors of the old G.ed.p171
vineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones, seems to favour their
opinion, and to indicate a consciousness in those who must have the ex-
periencethatthisspeciesofcultivationisatpresentinthatcountrymore
profitable thanany other. Itseems at the same time, however, toindicate
anotheropinion, thatthissuperiorprofitcanlastnolongerthanthelaws
whichatpresentrestrainthefreecultivationofthevine. In1731,theyob-
tained an order of council prohibiting both the planting of new vineyards
andtherenewalofthoseoldones,ofwhichthecultivationhadbeeninter-
ruptedfortwoyears,withoutaparticularpermissionfromtheking,tobe
granted only in consequence of an information from the intendant of the
province,certifyingthathehadexaminedtheland,andthatitwasincap-
able of any other culture. The pretence of this order was the scarcity of
corn and pasture, and the superabundance of wine. But had this super-
abundance been real, it would, without any order of council, have effectu-
ally prevented the plantation of new vineyards, by reducing the profits of
this species of cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn
and pasture. With regard to the supposed scarcity of corn, occasioned by
the multiplication of vineyards, corn is nowhere in France more carefully
cultivated than in the wine provinces, where the land is fit for producing
it; as in Burgundy, Guienne, and the Upper Languedoc. The numerous
handsemployedintheonespeciesofcultivationnecessarilyencouragethe
other,byaffordingareadymarketforitsproduce. Todiminishthenumber
of those who are capable of paying for it is surely a most unpromising ex-
125 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
pedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn. It is like the policy which
wouldpromoteagriculturebydiscouragingmanufactures.
392 [28] Therentandprofitofthoseproductions,therefore,whichrequireeither

or a greater annual expense of cultivation, though often much superior to
those of corn and pasture, yet when they do no more than compensate G.ed.p172
suchextraordinaryexpense,areinrealityregulatedbytherentandprofit
ofthosecommoncrops.
393 [29] It sometimes happens, indeed, that the quantity of land, which can be
fitted for some particular produce, is too small to supply the effectual de-
mand. The whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing to
give somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent, wages,
and profit necessary for raising and bringing it to market, according to
theirnaturalrates,oraccordingtotheratesatwhichtheyarepaidinthe
greater part of other cultivated land. The surplus part of the price which
remainsafterdefrayingthewholeexpenseofimprovementandcultivation
may commonly, in this case, and in this case only, bear no regular propor-
tiontothelikesurplusincornorpasture,butmayexceeditinalmostany

394 [30] The usual and natural proportion, for example, between the rent and
profit of wine and those of corn and pasture must be understood to take
placeonlywithregardtothosevineyardswhichproducenothingbutgood
common wine, such as can be raised almost anywhere, upon any light,

The whole quantity, therefore, can be disposed of to those who are will-
ing to pay more, which necessarily raises the price above that of common
wine. The difference is greater or less according as the fashionableness
andscarcityofthewinerenderthecompetitionofthebuyersmoreorless

For though such vineyards are in general more carefully cultivated than
most others, the high price of the wine seems to be not so much the effect
126 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
as the cause of this careful cultivation. In so valuable a produce the loss
occasioned by negligence is so great as to force even the most careless to G.ed.p173
attention. Asmallpartofthishighprice,therefore,issufficienttopaythe

396 [32] The sugar colonies possessed by the European nations in the West In-
dies may be compared to those precious vineyards. Their whole produce
falls short of the effectual demand of Europe, and can be disposed of to
thosewhoarewillingtogivemorethanwhatissufficienttopaythewhole
rent, profit, andwagesnecessaryforpreparingandbringingittomarket,
according to the rate at which they are commonly paid by any other pro-
duce. In Cochin China the finest white sugar commonly sells for three

naturallytakesplaceinthedifferentcropsofthegreaterpartofcultivated

becomputedaccordingtowhatisusuallytheoriginalexpenseofimprove-
mentandtheannualexpenseofcultivation. Butinoursugarcoloniesthe
price of sugar bears no such proportion to that of the produce of a rice
or corn field either in Europe or in America. It is commonly said that a
sugarplanterexpectsthattherumandmolassesshoulddefraythewhole
expense of his cultivation, and that his sugar should be all clear profit. If G.ed.p174
this be true, for I pretend not to affirm it, it is as if a corn farmer expec-
ted to defray the expense of his cultivation with the chaff and the straw,
and that the grain should be all clear profit. We see frequently societies

397 [33] In Virginia and Maryland the cultivation of tobacco is preferred, as

which necessarily gives a sort of monopoly to the countries where it is al-
lowed; and as Virginia and Maryland produce the greatest quantity of it,
theysharelargely,thoughwithsomecompetitors,intheadvantageofthis

ageousasthatofsugar. Ihaveneverevenheardofanytobaccoplantation
thatwasimprovedandcultivatedbythecapitalofmerchantswhoresided
in Great Britain, and our tobacco colonies send us home no such wealthy
plantersasweseefrequentlyarrivefromoursugarislands. Thoughfrom
the preference given in those colonies to the cultivation of tobacco above
that of corn, it would appear that the effectual demand of Europe for to-
bacco is not completely supplied, it probably is more nearly so than that
for sugar; and though the present price of tobacco is probably more than
sufficienttopaythewholerent,wages,andprofitnecessaryforpreparing
and bring it to market, according to the rate at which they are commonly
paid in corn land, it must not be so much more as the present price of
sugar. Ourtobaccoplanters,accordingly,haveshownthesamefearofthe

Francehaveofthesuperabundanceofwine. Byactofassemblytheyhave
restraineditscultivationtosixthousandplants,supposedtoyieldathou- G.ed.p175
sandweightoftobacco,foreverynegrobetweensixteenandsixtyyearsof

they reckon, four acres of Indian corn. To prevent the market from being
overstocked, too, they have sometimes, in plentiful years, we are told by
Dr. Douglas,(Isuspecthehasbeenillinformed)2 burntacertainquantity
of tobacco for every negro, in the same manner as the Dutch are said to
doof spices. If such violentmethodsarenecessaryto keepupthepresent
price of tobacco, the superior advantage of its culture over that of corn, if
itstillhasany,willnotprobablybeoflongcontinuance.
398 [34] It is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land, of which the

would immediately be turned to another use. And if any particular pro-
duce commonly affords more, it is because the quantity of land which can

399 [35] In Europe, corn is the principal produce of land which serves immedi-
ately for human food. Except in particular situations, therefore, the rent

128 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of corn land regulates in Europe that of all other cultivated land. Britain
needenvyneitherthevineyardsofFrancenortheoliveplantationsofItaly.
Except in particular situations, the value of these is regulated by that of
corn, in which the fertility of Britain is not much inferior to that of either
ofthosetwocountries.
400 [36] Ifinanycountrythecommonandfavouritevegetablefoodofthepeople

same or nearly the same culture, produced a much greater quantity than
themostfertiledoesofcorn,therentofthelandlord,orthesurplusquant-
ity of food which would remain to him, after paying the labour and re-
placing the stock of the farmer, together with its ordinary profits, would
necessarily be much greater. Whatever was the rate at which labour was G.ed.p176
commonly maintained in that country, this greater surplus could always
maintainagreaterquantityofit,andconsequentlyenablethelandlordto
purchase or command a greater quantity of it. The real value of his rent,

401 [37] Aricefieldproducesamuchgreaterquantityoffoodthanthemostfer-
tilecornfield. Twocropsintheyearfromthirtytosixtybushelseach,are
said to be the ordinary produce of an acre. Though its cultivation, there-
fore, requires more labour, a much greater surplus remains after main-
tainingallthatlabour. Inthosericecountries,therefore,wherericeisthe
common and favourite vegetable food of the people, and where the cultiv-
atorsarechieflymaintainedwithit,agreatershareofthisgreatersurplus
should belong to the landlord than in corn countries. In Carolina, where
the planters, as in other British colonies, are generally both farmers and

tivation of rice is found to be more profitable than that of corn, though

402 [38] Agoodricefieldisabogatallseasons,andatoneseasonabogcovered

for any other vegetable produce that is very useful to men; and the lands
which are fit for those purposes are not fit for rice. Even in the rice coun-

403 [39] The food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quantity to

by the acre of wheat. An acre of potatoes is cultivated with less expense
than an acre of wheat; the fallow, which generally precedes the sowing of
wheat, more than compensating the hoeing and other extraordinary cul-
ture which is always given to potatoes. Should this root ever become in
any part of Europe, like rice in some rice countries, the common and fa-
vourite vegetable food of the people, so as to occupy the same proportion
of the lands in tillage which wheat and other sorts of grain for human G.ed.p177

410 [4] The skins of the larger animals were the original materials of cloth-
ing. Among nations of hunters and shepherds, therefore, whose food con-
sists chiefly in the flesh of those animals, every man, by providing him-
self with food, provides himself with the materials of more clothing than
he can wear. If there was no foreign commerce, the greater part of them
would be thrown away as things of no value. This was probably the case
amongthehuntingnationsofNorthAmericabeforetheircountrywasdis-
covered by the Europeans, with whom they now exchange their surplus
peltry for blankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives it some value. In
the present commercial state of the known world, the mostbarbarous na-
tions, I believe, among whom land property is established, have some for-
eign commerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours
suchademandforallthematerialsofclothingwhichtheirlandproduces,
and which can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home, as raises
theirpriceabovewhatitcoststosendthemtothosewealthierneighbours.
It affords, therefore, some rent to the landlord. When the greater part G.ed.p179
of the highland cattle were consumed on their own hills, the exportation
of their hides made the most considerable article of the commerce of that
131 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
country, and what they were exchanged for afforded some addition to the

and of the coasts of the Baltic find a market in many parts of Great Bri-

theirproprietors.

ing and lodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be difficult
to find food. In some parts even of the British dominions what is called
a house may be built by one day’s labour of one man. The simplest spe-
cies of clothing, the skins of animals, require somewhat more labour to
dress and prepare them for use. They do not, however, require a great

will be sensible that the difference between their clothing, lodging, and
household furniture is almost as great in quantity as it is in quality. The
desireoffoodislimitedineverymanbythenarrowcapacityofthehuman

tainboundary. Those,therefore,whohavethecommandofmorefoodthan

or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for gratifications of this other
kind. Whatisoverandabovesatisfyingthelimiteddesireisgivenforthe
amusement of those desires which cannot be satisfied, but seem to be al-
together endless. The poor, in order to obtain food, exert themselves to
gratify those fancies of the rich, and to obtain it more certainly they vie
withoneanotherinthecheapnessandperfectionoftheirwork. Thenum-
berofworkmenincreaseswiththeincreasingquantityoffood,orwiththe
growing improvement and cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of
their business admits of the utmost subdivisions of labour, the quantity
of materials which they can work up increases in a much greater propor-
tionthantheirnumbers. Hencearisesademandforeverysortofmaterial

building, dress, equipage, or household furniture; for the fossils and min- G.ed.p182

preciousstones.
[8] Food is in this manner not only the original source of rent, but every
414
other part of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent derives
that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labour in
producingfoodbymeansoftheimprovementandcultivationofland.
415 [9] Those other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards
affordrent,donotafforditalways. Eveninimprovedandcultivatedcoun-
tries, the demand for them is not always such as to afford a greater price
than what is sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with it or-
dinaryprofits,thestockwhichmustbeemployedinbringingthemtomar-
ket. Whetheritisorisnotsuchdependsupondifferentcircumstances.
416 [10] Whether a coal-mine, for example, can afford any rent depends partly
uponitsfertility,andpartlyuponitssituation.
133 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
417 [11] A mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren, accord-
ing as the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain
quantityoflabourisgreaterorlessthanwhatcanbebroughtbyanequal

418 [12] Some coal-mines advantageously situated cannot be wrought on ac-
count of their barrenness. The produce does not pay the expense. They
canaffordneitherprofitnorrent.
419 [13] There are some of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the la-
bour, and replace, together with it ordinary profits, the stock employed in
workingthem. Theyaffordsomeprofittotheundertakerofthework, but
no rent to the landlord. They can be wrought advantageously by nobody
but the landlord, who, being himself undertaker of the work, gets the or-
dinary profit of the capital which he employs in it. Many coal-mines in
Scotlandarewroughtinthismanner,andcanbewroughtinnoother. The
landlord will allow nobody else to work them without paying some rent,
andnobodycanaffordtopayany.
420 [14] Other coal-mines in the same country, sufficiently fertile, cannot be
wrought on account of their situation. A quantity of mineral sufficient

[16] The price of wood again varies with the state of agriculture, nearly in

thewoods,thoughtheydonotdestroytheoldtrees,hinderanyyoungones
from coming up so that in the course of a century or two the whole forest

134 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
seemsinthepresenttimestobenearlythestateofthingsinseveralparts
of Great Britain, where the profit of planting is found to be equal to that
of either corn or pasture. The advantage which the landlord derives from
planting can nowhere exceed, at least for any considerable time, the rent
which these could afford him; and in an inland country which is highly
cultivated,itwillfrequentlynotfallmuchshortofthisrent. Uponthesea-
coast of a well improved country, indeed, if coals can conveniently be had

[18] Coals, in the coal countries, are everywhere much below this highest

works are abandoned altogether; others can afford no rent, and can be

426 [20] Rent, even where coals afford one, has generally a smaller share in
their prices than in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land.
Therentofanestateabovegroundcommonlyamountstowhatissupposed

independent of the occasional variations in the crop. In coal-mines a fifth

427 [21] Thevalueofacoal-minetotheproprietorfrequentlydependsasmuch
upon its situation as upon its fertility. That of a metallic mine depends
more upon its fertility, and less upon its situation. The coarse, and still
more the precious metals, when separated from the ore, are so valuable
that they can generally bear the expense of a very long land, and of the
mostdistantseacarriage. Theirmarketisnotconfinedtothecountriesin

428 [22] The price of coals in Westmoreland or Shropshire can have little effect
ontheirpriceatNewcastle;andtheirpriceintheLionnoiscanhavenone
at all. The productions of such distant coal-mines can never be brought
intocompetitionwithoneanother. Buttheproductionsofthemostdistant
metallicminesfrequentlymay,andinfactcommonlyare. Theprice,there-
fore, of the coarse, and still more that of the precious metals, at the most
fertile mines in the world, must necessarily more or less affect their price
ateveryotherinit. ThepriceofcopperinJapanmusthavesomeinfluence
upon its price at the copper mines in Europe. The price of silver in Peru,
or the quantity either of labour or of other goods which it will purchase
there, must have some influence on its price, not only at the silver mines
ofEurope,butatthoseofChina. AfterthediscoveryoftheminesofPeru,
thesilverminesofEuropewere,thegreaterpartofthem,abandoned. The
valueofwassomuchreducedthattheirproducecouldnolongerpaytheex-

and other necessaries which were consumed in that operation. This was
thecase,too,withtheminesofCubaandSt. Domingo,andevenwiththe
ancientminesofPeru,afterthediscoveryofthoseofPotosi.
429 [23] The price of every metal at every mine, therefore, being regulated in
some measure by its price at the most fertile mine in the world that is
actually wrought, it can at the greater part of mines do very little more
thanpaytheexpenseofworking,andcanseldomaffordaveryhighrentto
thelandlord. Rent,accordingly,seemsatthegreaterpartofminestohave G.ed.p186
but a small share in the price of the coarse, and a still smaller in that of
thepreciousmetals. Labourandprofitmakeupthegreaterpartofboth.
430 [24] A sixth part of the gross produce may be reckoned the average rent of
thetinminesofCornwallthemostfertilethatareknownintheworld,as
we are told by the Reverend Mr. Borlace, vice-warden of the stannaries.
Some, he says, afford more, and some do not afford so much. A sixth part
of the gross produce is the rent, too, of several very fertile lead mines in
Scotland.
431 [25] In the silver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the pro-
136 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
prietorfrequentlyexactsnootheracknowledgmentfromtheundertakerof
the mine, but that he will grind the ore at his mill, paying him the ordin-
ary multure or price of grinding. Till 1736, indeed, the tax of the King of
Spain amounted to one-fifth of the standard silver, which till then might
be considered as the real rent of the greater part of the silver mines of G.ed.p187
Peru, the richest which have been known in the world. If there had been
notaxthisfifthwouldnaturallyhavebelongedtothelandlord,andmany
minesmighthavebeenwroughtwhichcouldnotthenbewrought,because
they could not afford this tax. The tax of the Duke of Cornwall upon tin
is supposed to amount to more than five per cent or one-twentieth part
of the value, and whatever may be his proportion, it would naturally, too,
belong to the proprietor of the mine, if tin was duty free. But if you add
one-twentiethtoone-sixth,youwillfindthatthewholeaveragerentofthe
tinminesofCornwallwastothewholeaveragerentofthesilverminesof
Peruasthirteentotwelve. ButthesilverminesofPeruarenotnowableto
payeventhislowrent,andthetaxuponsilverwas,in1736,reducedfrom
one-fifth to one-tenth. Even this tax upon silver, too, gives more tempta-
tion to smuggling than the tax of one-twentieth upon tin; and smuggling
must be much easier in the precious than in the bulky commodity. The
tax of the King of Spain accordingly is said to be very ill paid, and that of
the Duke of Cornwall very well. Rent, therefore, it is probable, makes a
greater part of the price of tin at the most fertile tin mines than it does
of silver at the most fertile silver mines in the world. After replacing the
stock employed in working those different mines, together with its ordin-
aryprofits,theresiduewhichremainstotheproprietorisgreater,itseems,

432 [26] Neither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly
verygreatinPeru. Thesamemostrespectableandwell-informedauthors

433 [27] As the sovereign, however, derives a considerable part of his revenue G.ed.p188
from the produce of silver mines, the law in Peru gives every possible en-
couragementtothediscoveryandworkingofnewones. Whoeverdiscovers
a new mine is entitled to measure off two hundred and forty-six feet in

halfasmuchinbreadth. Hebecomesproprietorofthisportionofthemine,

Ulloa,tofindapersonwhohasmadehisfortunebyasilver,itisstillmuch
rarer to find one who has done so by a gold mine. This twentieth part G.ed.p189
seems to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater part of the gold
mines in Chili and Peru. Gold, too, is much more liable to be smuggled
than evensilver; not only on account ofthe superior value of the metal in
proportion to its bulk, but on account of the peculiar way in which nature
producesit. Silverisveryseldomfoundvirgin,but,likemostothermetals,
isgenerallymineralizedwithsomeotherbody,fromwhichitisimpossible
toseparateitinsuchquantitiesaswillpayfortheexpense, butbyavery
laborious and tedious operation, which cannot well be carried on but in

435 [29] Thelowestpriceatwhichthepreciousmetalscanbesold,orthesmal-
lest quantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged during any
considerable time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the low-
est ordinary price of all other goods. The stock which must commonly be
employed,thefood,thecloaths,andlodgingwhichmustcommonlybecon-
sumed in bringing them from the mine to the market, determine it. It
mustatleastbesufficienttoreplacethatstock,withtheordinaryprofits.
436 [30] Their highest price, however, seems not to be necessarily determined
by anything but the actual scarcity or plenty of those metals themselves.
It is not determined by that of any other commodity, in the same manner
as the price of coals is by that of wood, beyond which no scarcity can ever
raiseit. Increasethescarcityofgoldtoacertaindegree,andthesmallest
bit of it may become more precious than a diamond, and exchange for a

however, arises from their beauty, which renders them peculiarly fit for

scarcity. Withthegreaterpartofrichpeople,thechiefenjoymentofriches
consists in the parade of riches, which in their eye is never so complete
as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence which
nobody can possess but themselves. In their eyes the merit of an object
whichisinanydegreeeitherusefulorbeautifulisgreatlyenhancedbyits
scarcity,orbythegreatlabourwhichitrequirestocollectanyconsiderable
quantity of it, a labour which nobody can afford to pay but themselves.
Such objects they are willing to purchase at a higher price than things G.ed.p191
much more beautiful and useful, but more common. These qualities of
utility, beauty, and scarcity, are the original foundation of the high price
of those metals, or of the great quantity of other goods for which they can
everywherebeexchanged. Thisvaluewasantecedenttoandindependent
of their being employed as coin, and was the quality which fitted them
for that employment. That employment, however, by occasioning a new
demand,andbydiminishingthequantitywhichcouldbeemployedinany
other way, may have afterwards contributed to keep up or increase their
value.
438 [32] Thedemandforthepreciousstonesarisesaltogetherfromtheirbeauty.
They are of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is
greatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and expense of get-
ting them from the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon
most occasions, almost the whole of their high price. Rent comes in but
foraverysmallshare;frequentlyfornoshare;andthemostfertilemines
only afford any considerable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, visited the
diamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, he was informed that the sov-
ereign of the country, for whose benefit they were wrought, had ordered
all of them to be shut up, except those which yield the largest and finest
stones. Theothers,itseems,weretotheproprietornotworththeworking.
439 [33] As the price both of the precious metals and of the precious stones is
regulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in it,
the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in propor-
tion, not to its absolute, but to what may be called its relative fertility, or
to its superiority over other mines of the same kind. If new mines were
discovered as much superior to those of Potosi as they were superior to
those Europe, the value of silver might be so much degraded as to render
139 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
even the mines of Potosi not worth the working. Before the discovery of
the Spanish West Indies, the most fertile mines in Europe may have af-
forded as great a rent to their proprietor as the richest mines in Peru do
at present. Though the quantity of silver was much less, it might have
exchangedforanequalquantityofothergoods,andtheproprietor’sshare

etor,mighthavebeenthesame.
440 [34] The most abundant mines either of the precious metals or of the pre-
ciousstonescouldaddlittletothewealthoftheworld. Aproduceofwhich
the value is principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily degraded
by its abundance. A service of plate, and the other frivolous ornaments of
dress and furniture, could be purchased for a smaller quantity of labour,
orforasmallerquantityofcommodities;andinthiswouldconsistthesole
advantagewhichtheworldcouldderivefromthatabundance.
[35] Itisotherwiseinestatesaboveground. Thevaluebothoftheirproduce

andoftheirrentisinproportiontotheirabsolute,andnottotheirrelative
fertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food, cloaths, and
lodging, can always feed, clothe, and lodge a certain number of people;
and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will always give
him a proportionable command of the labour of those people, and of the
commodities with which that labour can supply him. The value of the
most barren lands is not diminished by the neighbourhood of the most
fertile. On the contrary, it is generally increased by it. The great number

[36] Whateverincreasesthefertilityoflandinproducingfoodincreasesnot

only the value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but
contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands by creating a
new demand for their produce. That abundance of food, of which, in con-
sequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal bey-
ond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the demand
both for the precious metals and the precious stone, as well as for every
other conveniency and ornament of dress, lodging, household furniture,

They gave them to their new guests at the first request, without seeming
140 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to think that they had made them any very valuable present. They were G.ed.p193

no notion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people

PART III
Of the Variations in the Proportion between
the respective Values of that Sort of Produce
which always affords Rent, and of that which
sometimes does and sometimes does not
afford Rent
443 [1] The increasing abundance of food, in consequence of increasing improve-
mentandcultivation,mustnecessarilyincreasethedemandforeverypart
oftheproduceoflandwhichisnotfood,andwhichcanbeappliedeitherto
useortoornament. Inthewholeprogressofimprovement,itmightthere-
fore be expected, there should be only one variation in the comparative
valuesofthosetwodifferentsortsofproduce. Thevalueofthatsortwhich
sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent, should constantly
rise in proportion to that which always affords some rent. As art and in-
dustry advance, the materials of clothing and lodging, the useful fossils
and minerals of the earth, the precious metals and the precious stones
should gradually come to be more and more in demand, should gradually
exchange for a greater and a greater quantity of food, or in other words,
shouldgraduallybecomedeareranddearer. Thisaccordinglyhasbeenthe
case with most of these things upon most occasions, and would have been

[2] Thevalueofafree-stonequarry,forexample,willnecessarilyincrease

thevalueofasilvermine,eventhoughthereshouldnotbeanotherwithin

of the country in which it is situated. The market for the produce of a

and the demand must generally be in proportion to the improvement and

forsilvermightnotbeatallincreasedbytheimprovementevenofalarge
country in the neighbourhood of the mine. Even though the world in gen-
eral were improving, yet if, in the course of its improvement, new mines
should be discovered, much more fertile than any which had been known
before, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase, yet the
supply might increase in so much a greater proportion that the real price
of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a pound

445 [3] The great market for silver is the commercial and civilised part of the
world.
446 [4] If by the general progress of improvement the demand of this market
shouldincrease,whileatthesametimethesupplydidnotincreaseinthe

thatofcorn. Anygivenquantityofsilverwouldexchangeforagreaterand

which can happen in the progress of improvement; and during the course
of the four centuries preceding the present, if we may judge by what has
happened both in France and Great Britain, each of those three differ-
ent combinations seem to have taken place in the European market, and G.ed.p195

142 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Digression concerning the Variations in the
Value of Silver during the Course of the Four
last Centuries
FIRST PERIOD
450 [1] In1350,andforsometimebefore,theaveragepriceofthequarterofwheat
in England seems not to have been estimated lower than four ounces of
silver,Towerweight,equaltoabouttwentyshillingsofourpresentmoney.
From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of silver,
equal to about ten shillings of our present money, the price at which we
finditestimatedinthebeginningofthesixteenthcentury,andatwhichit
seemstohavecontinuedtobeestimatedtillabout1570.
451 [2] In 1350, being the 25th of Edward III, was enacted what is called The
Statute of Labourers. In the preamble it complains much of the insolence
of servants, who endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters. It
therefore ordains that all servants and labourers should for the future be
contented with the same wages and liveries (liveries in those times signi-
fied not only cloaths but provisions) which they had been accustomed to
receive in the 20th year of the king, and the four preceding years; that
upon this account their livery wheat should nowhere be estimated higher
than tenpence a bushel, and that it should always be in the option of the
mastertodeliverthemeitherthewheatorthemoney. Ten-penceabushel,
therefore, had, in the 25th of Edward III, been reckoned a very moderate
price of wheat, since it required a particular statute to oblige servants to
acceptofitinexchangefortheirusualliveryofprovisions;andithadbeen
reckoned a reasonable price ten years before that, or in the 16th year of
theking,thetermtowhichthestatuterefers. Butinthe16thyearofEd-
ward III, tenpence contained about half an ounce of silver, Tower-weight,
andwasnearlyequaltohalf-a-crownofourpresentmoney. Fourouncesof
silver,Towerweight,therefore,equaltosixshillingsandeightpenceofthe
money of those times, and to near twenty shillings of that of the present,
musthavebeenreckonedamoderatepriceforthequarterofeightbushels.
452 [3] This statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned in those
times a moderate price of grain than the prices of some particular years
which have generally been recorded by historians and other writers on
account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness, and from which, G.ed.p196
therefore, it is difficult to form any judgment concerning what may have
been the ordinary price. There are, besides, other reasons for believing
that in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and for some time before,
143 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the common price of wheat was not less than four ounces of silver the
quarter,andthatofothergraininproportion.
453 [4] In 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, gave a
feastuponhisinstallation-day, ofwhichWilliamThornhaspreservednot
only the bill of fare but the prices of many particulars. In that feast were
consumed,first,fifty-threequartersofwheat,whichcostnineteenpounds,
or seven shillings and twopence a quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty
shillings and sixpence of our present money; secondly, fifty-eight quar-
ters of malt, which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings
a quarter, equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money; thirdly,
twentyquartersofoats,whichcostfourpounds,orfourshillingsaquarter,
equal to about twelve shillings of our present money. The prices of malt
andoatsseemheretobehigherthantheirordinaryproportiontotheprice
ofwheat.
454 [5] These prices are not recorded on account of their extraordinary dear-
ness or cheapness, but are mentioned accidentally as the prices actually
paid for large quantities of grain consumed at a feast which was famous
foritsmagnificence.
455 [6] In 1262, being the 51st of Henry III, was revived an ancient statute
called The Assize of Bread and Ale, which the king says in the preamble
had been made in the times of his progenitors, sometime kings of Eng-
land. Itisprobably,therefore,asoldatleastasthetimeofhisgrandfather G.ed.p197
Henry II, and may have been as old as the Conquest. It regulates the
priceofbreadaccordingasthepricesofwheatmayhappentobe,fromone
shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times. But
statutesofthiskindaregenerallypresumedtoprovidewithequalcarefor
alldeviationsfromthemiddleprice,forthosebelowitaswellasforthose
above it. Ten shillings, therefore, containing six ounces of silver, Tower
weight, and equal to about thirty shillings of our present money, must,
uponthissupposition,havebeenreckonedthemiddlepriceofthequarter
of wheat when this statute was first enacted, and must have continued to

ing that the middle price was not less than one-third of the highest price
atwhichthisstatuteregulatesthepriceofbread,orthansixshillingsand
eightpence of the money of those times, containing four ounces of silver,

456 [7] From these different facts, therefore, we seem to have some reason to
concludethat,aboutthemiddleofthefourteenthcentury,andforaconsid-
erable time before, the average or ordinary price of the quarter of wheat
wasnotsupposedtobelessthanfourouncesofsilver,Tower-weight.
457 [8] From about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the six-
teenth century, what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate, that is
the ordinary or average price of wheat, seems to have sunk gradually to
aboutone-halfofthisprice;soasatlasttohavefallentoabouttwoounces
144 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of silver, Tower weight, equal to about ten shillings of our present money.
Itcontinuedtobeestimatedatthispricetillabout1570.
458 [9] InthehousholdbookofHenry,thefifthEarlofNorthumberland,drawn
up in 1512, there are two different estimations of wheat. In one of them
it iscomputed atsix shillingsand eight-pencethe quarter, in the otherat
five shillings and eight-pence only. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence
containedonlytwoouncesofsilver,Tower-weight,andwereequaltoabout
tenshillingsofourpresentmoney.
459 [10] From the 25th of Edward III to the beginning of the reign of Eliza-
beth, during the space of more than two hundred years, six shillings and
eight-pence, it appears from several different statutes, had continued to G.ed.p198
be considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable, that is the
ordinary or average price of wheat. The quantity of silver, however, con-
tained in that nominal sum was, during the course of this period, con-
tinuallydiminishing,inconsequenceofsomealterationswhichweremade
in the coin. But the increase of the value of silver had, it seems, so far
compensated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the same
nominalsumthatthelegislaturedidnotthinkitworthwhiletoattendto
thiscircumstance.
460 [11] Thus in 1436 it was enacted that wheat might be exported without a
licence when the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence; and in
1463 it was enacted that no wheat should be imported if the price was
not above six shillings and eightpence the quarter. The legislature had
imagined that when the price was so low there could be no inconveniency
in exportation, but that when it rose higher it became prudent to allow
importation. Sixshillingsandeightpence, therefore, containingaboutthe
same quantity of silver as thirteen shillings and fourpence of our present
money (one third part less than the same nominal sum contained in the
time of Edward III), had in those times been considered as what is called
themoderateandreasonablepriceofwheat.
461 [12] In 1554, by the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary; and in 1558, by the
1st of Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the same manner pro-
hibited, whenever the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and
eight-pence, which didnot thencontain two pennyworthmore silverthan
thesamenominalsumdoesatpresent. Butithadsoonbeenfoundthatto

at this time, therefore, been considered as what is called the moderate
andreasonablepriceofwheat. Itagreesnearlywiththeestimationofthe
Northumberlandbookin1512.
462 [13] That in France the average price of grain was, in the same manner,
much lower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
145 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
century than in the two centuries preceding has been observed both by
Mr. Dupre de St. Maur, and by the elegant author of the Essay on the po- G.ed.p199
lice of grain. Its price, during the same period, had probably sunk in the
samemannerthroughthegreaterpartofEurope.
463 [14] Thisriseinthevalueofsilverinproportiontothatofcorn,mayeither

tionofthesupply;thegreaterpartofthemineswhichwerethenknownin
the world being much exhausted, and consequently the expense of work-
ingthemmuchincreased;oritmayhavebeenowingpartlytotheotherof
those two circumstances. In the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the
sixteenth centuries, the greater part of Europe was approaching towards
a more settled form of government than it had enjoyed for several ages
before. Theincreaseofsecuritywouldnaturallyincreaseindustryandim-
provement; and the demand for the precious metals, as well as for every
otherluxuryandornament,wouldnaturallyincreasewiththeincreaseof
riches. Agreaterannualproducewouldrequireagreaterquantityofcoin

too, that the greater part of the mines which then supplied the European
marketwithsilvermightbeagooddealexhausted,andhavebecomemore
expensiveintheworking. Theyhadbeenwroughtmanyofthemfromthe
timeoftheRomans.
464 [15] Ithasbeentheopinion,however,ofthegreaterpartofthosewhohave
writtenuponthepriceofcommoditiesinancienttimesthat,fromtheCon-
quest, perhaps from the invasion of Julius Caesar till the discovery of the
mines of America, the value of silver was continually diminishing. This
opiniontheyseemto have beenledinto, partlybytheobservationswhich G.ed.p200
they had occasion to make upon the prices both of corn and of some other
parts of the rude produce of land; and partly by the popular notion that
as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country with the in-
creaseofwealth,soitsvaluediminishesasitsquantityincreases.
465 [16] In their observations upon the prices of corn, three different circum-
stancesseemfrequentlytohavemisledthem.
466 [17] First, in ancient times almost all rents were paid in kind; in a certain
quantityofcorn,cattle,poultry,etc. Itsometimeshappened,however,that
thelandlordwouldstipulatethatheshouldbeatlibertytodemandofthe
tenant, either the annual payment in kind, or a certain sum of money in-
stead of it. The price at which the payment in kind was in this manner

mentofanassize,oftheaveragepriceofallthedifferentsortsofgrain,and
of all the different qualities of each, according to the actual market price
in every different county. This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for
thetenant,andmuchmoreconvenientforthelandlord,toconvert,asthey
call it, the corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of the
fiarsofeachyear,thanatanycertainfixedprice. Butthewriterswhohave
collected the prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to have mis- G.ed.p201
takenwhatiscalledinScotlandtheconversionpricefortheactualmarket
price. Fleetwood acknowledges, upon one occasion, that he had made this
mistake. As he wrote his book, however, for a particular purpose, he does
not think proper to make this acknowledgment till after transcribing this
conversion price fifteen times. The price is eight shillings the quarter of
wheat. This sum in 1423, the year at which he begins with it, contained
the same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings of our present money. But
in 1562, the year at which he ends with it, it contained no more than the
samenominalsumdoesatpresent.
467 [18] Secondly,theyhavebeenmisledbytheslovenlymannerinwhichsome
ancientstatutesofassizehadbeensometimestranscribedbylazycopiers;
andsometimesperhapsactuallycomposedbythelegislature.
468 [19] Theancientstatutesofassizeseemtohavebegunalwayswithdeterm-
ining what ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat
andbarleywereatthelowest,andtohaveproceededgraduallytodeterm-
ine what it ought to be, according as the prices of those two sorts of grain G.ed.p202
shouldgraduallyriseabovethislowestprice. Butthetranscribersofthose
statutes seem frequently to have thought it sufficient to copy the regu-
lation as far as the three or four first and lowest prices, saving in this
mannertheir ownlabour, andjudging, I suppose, that thiswas enoughto
showwhatproportionoughttobeobservedinallhigherprices.
469 [20] ThusintheAssizeofBreadandAle,ofthe51stofHenryIII,theprice
of bread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat, from
one shilling to twenty shillings the quarter, of the money of those times.
But in the manuscripts from which all the different editions of the stat-
utes, preceding that of Mr. Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had never
transcribed this regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings. Several
writers, therefore, being misled by this faulty transcription, very natur-
ally concluded that the middle price, or six shillings the quarter, equal to
abouteighteenshillingsofourpresentmoney,wastheordinaryoraverage
priceofwheatatthattime.
470 [21] In the Statute of Tumbrel and Pillory, enacted nearly about the same
time, the price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence rise in the
147 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
price of barley, from two shillings to four shillings the quarter. That four
shillings,however,wasnotconsideredasthehighestpricetowhichbarley
mightfrequentlyriseinthosetimes,andthatthesepriceswereonlygiven
as an example of the proportion which ought to be observed in all other
prices, whether higher or lower, we may infer from the last words of the
statute: et sic deinceps crescetur vel diminuetur per sex denarios. The
expression is very slovenly, but the meaning is plain enough: ‘That the
price of ale is in this manner to be increased or diminished according to
everysixpenceriseorfallinthepriceofbarley’. Inthecompositionofthis
statutethelegislatureitselfseemstohavebeenasnegligentasthecopiers
wereinthetranscriptionoftheother.
471 [22] InanancientmanuscriptoftheRegiamMajestatem,anoldScotchlaw
book,thereisastatuteofassizeinwhichthepriceofbreadisregulatedac-
cordingtoallthedifferentpricesofwheat,fromtenpencetothreeshillings
the Scotch boll, equal to about half an English quarter. Three shillings
Scotch,atthetimewhenthisassizeissupposedtohavebeenenactedwere
equaltoaboutnineshillingssterlingofourpresentmoney. Mr.Ruddiman G.ed.p203
seems3 to conclude from this, that three shillings was the highest price
to which wheat ever rose in those times, and that tenpence, a shilling, or
at most two shillings, were the ordinary prices. Upon consulting the ma-
nuscript, however, it appears evidently that all these prices are only set
down as examples of the proportion which ought to be observed between
the respective prices of wheat and bread. The last words of the statute
are: reliqua judicabis secundum proescripta habendo respectum ad pre-
tium bladi. ‘You shall judge of the remaining cases according to what is
abovewritten,havingarespecttothepriceofcorn.’
472 [23] Thirdly, they seem to have been misled, too, by the very low price at
which wheat was sometimes sold in very ancient times; and to have ima-
gined that as its lowest price was then much lower than in later times,
its ordinary price must likewise have been much lower. They might have
found, however, that in those ancient times its highest price was fully as
much above, as its lowest price was below anything that had even been
known in later times. Thus in 1270, Fleetwood gives us two prices of the
quarterofwheat. Theoneisfourpoundssixteenshillingsofthemoneyof
thosetimes,equaltofourteenpoundseightshillingsofthatofthepresent;
theotherissixpoundseightshillings,equaltonineteenpoundsfourshil-

473 [24] The reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat
whichhavebeencollectedbyFleetwoodfrom1202to1597,bothinclusive,
reduced to the money of the present times, and digested according to the
orderoftime,intosevendivisionsoftwelveyearseach. Attheendofeach
division, too, he will find the average price of the twelve years of which
it consists. In that long period of time, Fleetwood has been able to collect
the prices of no more than eighty years, so that four years are wanting to
makeoutthelasttwelveyears. Ihaveadded,therefore,fromtheaccounts
of Eton college, the prices of 1598, 1599, 1600, and 1601. It is the only
addition which I have made. The reader will see that from the beginning
ofthethirteenthtillafterthemiddleofthesixteenthcenturytheaverage
price of each twelve years grows gradually lower and lower; and that to-
wards the end of the sixteenth century it begins to rise again. The prices,
indeed,whichFleetwoodhasbeenabletocollect,seemtohavebeenthose
chiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary dearness or cheapness;
and I do not pretend that any very certain conclusion can be drawn from
them. So far, however, as they prove anything at all, they confirm the
accountwhichI havebeenendeavouring togive. Fleetwoodhimself, how-
ever, seems, with most other writers, to have believed that during all this
periodthevalueofsilver,inconsequenceofitsincreasingabundance,was
continuallydiminishing. Thepricesofcornwhichhehimselfhascollected
certainlydonotagreewiththisopinion. Theyagreeperfectlywiththatof
Mr. Dupre de St. Maur, and with that which I have been endeavouring to
explain. BishopFleetwoodandMr.DupredeSt.Maurarethetwoauthors G.ed.p205

474 [25] It is not, however, so much from the low price of corn as from that of
someotherpartsoftherudeproduceoflandthatthemostjudiciouswriters
have inferred the great value of silver in those very ancient times. Corn,
it has been said, being a sort of manufacture, was, in those rude ages,
muchdearerinproportionthanthegreaterpartofothercommodities;itis
meant, I suppose, than the greater part of unmanufactured commodities,
suchascattle,poultry,gameofallkinds,etc. Thatinthosetimesofpoverty
and barbarism these were proportionably much cheaper than corn is un-
149 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
doubtedly true. But this cheapness was not the effect of the high value
of silver, but of the low value of those commodities. It was not because
silver would in such times purchase or represent a greater quantity of la-
bour, but because such commodities would purchase or represent a much
smaller quantity than in times of more opulence and improvement. Sil-
ver must certainly be cheaper in Spanish America than in Europe; in the
country where it is produced than in the country to which it is brought,
attheexpenseofalongcarriagebothbylandandbysea, ofafreightand
an insurance. One-and-twenty pence halfpenny sterling, however, we are
told by Ulloa, was, not many years ago, at Buenos Ayres, the price of an
oxchosenfromaherdofthreeorfourhundred. Sixteenshillingssterling,
we are told by Mr. Byron was the price of a good horse in the capital of
Chili. In a country naturally fertile, but of which the far greater part is
altogetheruncultivated,cattle,poultry,gameofallkinds,etc.,astheycan
be acquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will purchase or
command but a very small quantity. The low money price for which they G.ed.p206
maybesoldisnoproofthattherealvalueofsilveristhereveryhigh,but
thattherealvalueofthosecommoditiesisverylow.
475 [26] Labour, it must always be remembered, and not any particular com-
modityorsetofcommodities,istherealmeasureofthevaluebothofsilver
andofallothercommodities.

sumptionoftheinhabitantsrequires. Insuchastateofthingsthesupply
commonly exceeds the demand. In different states of society, in different
stages of improvement, therefore, such commodities will represent, or be
equivalentto,verydifferentquantitiesoflabour.
477 [28] In every state of society, in every stage of improvement, corn is the
production of human industry. But the average produce of every sort of
industry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the average consump-
tion;theaveragesupplytotheaveragedemand. Ineverydifferentstageof
improvement, besides, the raising of equal quantities of corn in the same
soil and climate will, at an average, require nearly equal quantities of la-
bour;orwhatcomestothesamething,thepriceofnearlyequalquantities;
the continual increase of the productive powers of labour in an improving
state of cultivation being more or less counterbalanced by the continually
increasing price of cattle, the principal instruments of agriculture. Upon
all these accounts, therefore, we may rest assured that equal quantities
of corn will, in every state of society, in every stage of improvement, more
nearlyrepresent,orbeequivalentto,equalquantitiesoflabourthanequal
quantitiesofanyotherpartoftherudeproduceofland. Corn,accordingly,
it has already been observed, is, in all the different stages of wealth and
improvement, a more accurate measure of value than any other commod-
ity or set of commodities. In all those different stages, therefore, we can
150 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
judge better of the real value of silver by comparing it with corn than by
comparingitwithanyothercommodityorsetofcommodities.
478 [29] Corn, besides, orwhateverelseisthecommonandfavouritevegetable
foodofthepeople,constitutes,ineverycivilisedcountry,theprincipalpart
ofthesubsistenceofthelabourer. Inconsequenceoftheextensionofagri-
culture,thelandofeverycountryproducesamuchgreaterquantityofve- G.ed.p207
getablethanofanimalfood,andthelabourereverywhereliveschieflyupon
the wholesome food that is cheapest and most abundant. Butcher’s meat,
except in the most thriving countries, or where labour is most highly re-
warded,makesbutaninsignificantpartofhissubsistence;poultrymakes
a still smaller part of it, and game no part of it. In France, and even
in Scotland, where labour is somewhat better rewarded than in France,
the labouring poor seldom eat butcher’s meat, except upon holidays, and
other extraordinary occasions. The money price of labour, therefore, de-
pendsmuchmoreupontheaveragemoneypriceofcorn,thesubsistenceof
the labourer, than upon that of butcher’s meat, or of any other part of the
rudeproduceof land. Thereal value ofgoldandsilver, therefore, thereal
quantity of labour which they can purchase or command, depends much
moreuponthequantityofcornwhichtheycanpurchaseorcommandthan
uponthatofbutcher’smeat,oranyotherpartoftherudeproduceofland.
479 [30] Such slight observations, however, upon the prices either of corn or of
other commodities, would not probably have misled so many intelligent
authors had they not been influenced, at the same time, by the popular
notion, that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country
withtheincreaseofsoitsvaluediminishesasitsquantityincreases. This
notion,however,seemstobealtogethergroundless.
480 [31] The quantity of the precious metals may increase in any country from
two different causes; either, first, from the increased abundance of the
mines which supply it; or, secondly, from the increased wealth of the
people, from the increased produce of their annual labour. The first of
these causes is no doubt necessarily connected with the diminution of the
valueofthepreciousmetals,butthesecondisnot.
481 [32] When more abundant mines are discovered, a greater quantity of the
precious metals is brought to market, and the quantity of the necessaries
andconvenienciesoflifeforwhichtheymustbeexchangedbeingthesame
as before, equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller
quantitiesofcommodities. Sofar,therefore,astheincreaseofthequantity
ofthepreciousmetalsinanycountryarisesfromtheincreasedabundance
of the mines, it is necessarily connected with some diminution of their
value.
482 [33] When, on the contrary, the wealth of any country increases, when the
annual produce of its labour becomes gradually greater and greater, a G.ed.p208
greater quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater
quantityofcommodities;andthepeople,astheycanaffordit,astheyhave
more commodities to give for it, will naturally purchase a greater and a
151 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
greaterquantityofplate. Thequantityoftheircoinwillincreasefromne-
cessity;thequantityoftheirplatefromvanityandostentation,orfromthe
samereasonthatthequantityoffinestatues,pictures,andofeveryother
luxury and curiosity, is likely to increase among them. But as statuaries
and painters are not likely to be worse rewarded in times of wealth and
prosperity than in times of poverty and depression, so gold and silver are
notlikelytobeworsepaidfor.
483 [34] The price of gold and silver, when the accidental discovery of more
abundant mines does not keep it down, as it naturally rises with the
wealth of every country, so, whatever be the state of the mines, it is at
alltimesnaturallyhigherinarichthaninapoorcountry. Goldandsilver,
likeallothercommodities,naturallyseekthemarketwherethebestprice
is given for them, and the best price is commonly given for every thing
in the country which can best afford it. Labour, it must be remembered,
is the ultimate price which is paid for everything, and in countries where
labour is equally well regarded, the money price of labour will be in pro-
portion to that of the subsistence of the labourer. But gold and silver will
naturally exchange for a greater quantity of subsistence in a rich than
in a poor country, in a country which abounds with subsistence than in
one which is but indifferently supplied with it. If the two countries are
at a great distance, the difference may be very great; because though the
metals naturally fly from the worse to the better market, yet it may be
difficulttotransporttheminsuchquantitiesastobringtheirpricenearly
to a level in both. If the countries are near, the difference will be smaller,
and may sometimes be scarce perceptible; because in this case the trans-
portation will be easy. China is a much richer country than any part of
Europe, and the difference between the price of subsistence in China and
inEuropeisverygreat. RiceinChinaismuchcheaperthanwheatisany-
where in Europe. England is a much richer country than Scotland; but
the difference between the money-price of corn in those two countries is
much smaller, and is but just perceptible. In proportion to the quantity
or measure, Scotch corn generally appears to be a good deal cheaper than
English; but in proportion to its quality, it is certainly somewhat dearer.

484 [35] The difference between the money price of labour in China and in
Europe is still greater than that between the money price of subsistence;
because the real recompense of labour is higher in Europe than in China,

152 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
in England because the real recompense of labour is much lower; Scot-
land, though advancing to greater wealth, advancing much more slowly
than England. The frequency of emigration from Scotland, and the rarity
of it from England, sufficiently prove that the demand for labour is very
different in the two countries. The proportion between the real recom-
penseoflabourindifferentcountries,itmustberemembered,isnaturally
regulated not by their actual wealth or poverty, but by their advancing,

are rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and manufacturers; in
every sort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge labour; in ship-
ping, and in all the other instruments and means of carriage and com-
merce: but they are poor in corn, which, as it must be brought to them
from distant countries, must, by an addition to its price, pay for the car-
riage from those countries. It does not cost less labour to bring silver to
Amsterdam than to Dantzic; but it costs a great deal more to bring corn.
The real cost of silver must be nearly the same in both places; but that of
corn must be very different. Diminish the real opulence either of Holland

SECOND PERIOD
489 [1] But how various soever may have been the opinions of the learned con-
cerningtheprogressofthevalueofsilverduringthisfirstperiod,theyare
unanimousconcerningitduringthesecond.
490 [2] Fromabout1570toabout1640,duringaperiodofaboutseventyyears,
thevariationintheproportionbetweenthevalueofsilverandthatofcorn
held a quite opposite course. Silver sunk in its real value, or would ex-
change for a smaller quantity of labour than before; and corn rose in its
nominalprice,andinsteadofbeingcommonlysoldforabouttwoouncesof
silver the quarter, or about ten shillings of our present money, came to be
soldforsixandeightouncesofsilverthequarter,oraboutthirtyandforty
shillingsofourpresentmoney.
491 [3] ThediscoveryoftheabundantminesofAmericaseemstohavebeenthe
sole cause of this diminution in the value of silver in proportion to that of
corn. Itisaccountedforaccordinglyinthesamemannerbyeverybody;and
there never has been any dispute either about the fact or about the cause G.ed.p211
of it. The greater part of Europe was, during this period, advancing in
industry and improvement, and the demand for silver must consequently
have been increasing. But the increase of the supply had, it seems, so far
exceeded that of the demand, that the value of that metal sunk consider-
ably. The discovery of the mines of America, it is to be observed, does not
seemtohavehadanyverysensibleeffectuponthepricesofthingsinEng-
land till after 1570; though even the mines of Potosi had been discovered
morethantwentyyearsbefore.
492 [4] From 1595 to 1620, both inclusive, the average price of the quarter
of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market appears, from the
accounts of Eton College, to have been 2l.1s.6d. 9 . From which sum,
13
neglecting the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or 4s.7d.1, the price of
3
the quarter of eight bushels comes out to have been 1l.16s.10d.2. And
3
from this sum, neglecting likewise the fraction, and deducting a ninth, or
4s.1d.1, forthedifferencebetweenthepriceofthebestwheatandthatof

foregoing case, the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle
154 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
wheat comes out to have been 1l.19s.6d., or about seven ounces and two-
thirdsofanounceofsilver.
THIRD PERIOD
494 [1] Between 1630 and 1640, or about 1636, the effect of the discovery of the
minesofAmericainreducingthevalueofsilverappearstohavebeencom-
pleted, and the value of that metal seems never to have sunk lower in
proportion to that of corn than it was about that time. It seems to have
risen somewhat in the course of the present century, and it had probably
beguntodosoevensometimebeforetheendofthelast.
495 [2] From 1637 to 1700, both inclusive, being the sixty-four last years of
the last century, the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the
best wheat at Windsor market appears, from the same accounts, to have
been 2l.11s.0d.1; which is only 1s.0d.1 dearer than it had been during G.ed.p212
3 3
the sixteen years before. But in the course of these sixty-four years there
happenedtwoeventswhichmusthaveproducedamuchgreaterscarcityof
cornthanwhatthecourseoftheseasonswouldotherwisehaveoccasioned,
andwhich,therefore,withoutsupposinganyfurtherreductioninthevalue
ofsilver,willmuchmorethanaccountforthisverysmallenhancementof
price.
496 [3] The first of these events was the civil war, which, by discouraging till-
age and interrupting commerce, must have raised the price of corn much
abovewhatthecourseoftheseasonswouldotherwisehaveoccasioned. It
must have had this effect more or less at all the different markets in the
kingdom,butparticularlyatthoseintheneighbourhoodofLondon,which
require to be supplied from the greatest distance. In 1648, accordingly,
thepriceofthebestwheatatWindsormarketappears,fromthesameac-
counts,tohavebeen4l.5s.andin1649tohavebeen4l.thequarterofnine
bushels. The excess of those two years above 2l.10s. (the average price
of the sixteen years preceding 1637) is 3l.5s.; which divided among the
sixty-four last years of the last century will alone very nearly account for
thatsmallenhancementofpricewhichseemstohavetakenplaceinthem.
These, however, thoughthehighest, arebynomeanstheonlyhighprices
whichseemtohavebeenoccasionedbythecivilwars.
497 [4] Thesecondeventwasthebountyupontheexportationofcorngranted
in 1688. The bounty, it has been thought by many people, by encouraging
tillage, may, in a long course of years, have occasioned a greater abund-
ance, and consequently a greater cheapness of corn in the home-market
than what would otherwise have taken place there. How far the bounty
could produce this effect at any time, I shall examine hereafter; I shall
only observe at present that, between 1688 and 1700, it had not time to
produceanysucheffect. Duringthisshortperioditsonlyeffectmusthave
been,byencouragingtheexportationofthesurplusproduceofeveryyear,
155 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
and thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compensating the
scarcity of another, to raise the price in the home-market. The scarcity
which prevailed in England from 1693 to 1699, both inclusive, though no
doubt principally owing to the badness of the seasons, and, therefore, ex-
tendingthroughaconsiderablepartofEurope,musthavebeensomewhat G.ed.p213
enhanced by the bounty. In 1699, accordingly, the further exportation of
cornwasprohibitedforninemonths.
498 [5] There was a third event which occurred in the course of the same
period, and which, though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn, nor,
perhaps, any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usu-
ally paid for it, must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in
thenominalsum. Thiseventwasthegreatdebasementofthesilvercoin,
by clipping and wearing. This evil had begun in the reign of Charles II
and had gone on continually increasing till 1695; at which time, as we
may learn from Mr. Lowndes, the current silver coin was, at an average,
near five-and-twenty per cent below its standard value. But the nominal
sum which constitutes the market price of every commodity is necessar-
ily regulated, not so much by the quantity of silver, which, according to
the standard, ought to be contained in it, as by that which, it is found by
experience,actuallyiscontainedinit. Thisnominalsum,therefore,isne-
cessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and wearing
thanwhenneartoitsstandardvalue.
499 [6] Inthecourseofthepresentcentury,thesilvercoinhasnotatanytime
been more below its standard weight than it is at present. But though
very much defaced, its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin for
which it is exchanged. For though before the late recoinage, the gold coin
was a good deal defaced too, it was less so than the silver. In 1695, on
the contrary, the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold coin;
a guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty shillings of the worn and
cliptsilver. Beforethelaterecoinageofthegold,thepriceofsilverbullion
was seldom higher than five shillings and sevenpence an ounce, which is
but fivepence above the mint price. But in 1695, the common price of sil-
verbullionwassixshillingsandfivepenceanounce4,whichisfifteenpence
abovethemintprice. Evenbeforethelaterecoinageofthegold,therefore,
thecoin,goldandsilvertogether,whencomparedwithsilverbullion,was
not supposed to be more than eight per cent below its standard value. In G.ed.p214
1695,onthecontrary,ithadbeensupposedtobenearfive-and-twentyper
centbelowthatvalue. Butinthebeginningofthepresentcentury,thatis,
immediatelyafterthegreatrecoinageinKingWilliam’stime. thegreater
part of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to its stand-
ard weight than it is at present. In the course of the present century, too,

Andthoughthebounty,whichhastakenplacethroughthegreaterpartof
this century, must always raise the price of corn somewhat higher than it
otherwise would be in the actual state of tillage; yet as, in the course of
this century, the bounty has had full time to produce all the good effects
commonly imputed to it, to encourage tillage, and thereby to increase the
quantity of corn in the home market, it may, upon the principles of a sys-
temwhichIshallexplainandexaminehereafter,besupposedtohavedone
something to lower the price of that commodity the one way, as well as to
raise it the other. It is by many people supposed to have done more. In
the sixty-four first years of the present century accordingly the average
price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor market
appears, by the accounts of Eton College, to have been 2l.0s.6d.19, which
32
isabouttenshillingsandsixpence,ormorethanfive-and-twentypercent,
cheaper than it had been during the sixty-four last years of the last cen-

besupposedtohaveproduceditsfulleffect;andaboutoneshillingcheaper
than it had been in the twenty-six years preceding 1620, before that dis-
covery can well be supposed to have produced its full effect. According to
this account, the average price of middle wheat, during these sixty-four
firstyearsofthepresentcentury,comesouttohavebeenaboutthirty-two
shillingsthequarterofeightbushels.
500 [7] Thevalueofsilver,therefore,seemstohaverisensomewhatinpropor-
tion to that of corn during the course of the present century, and it had
probablybeguntodosoevensometimebeforetheendofthelast.
501 [8] In 1687, the price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at
Windsor market was 1l.5s.2d. the lowest price at which it had ever been
from1595.
502 [9] In1688,Mr.GregoryKing,amanfamousforhisknowledgeinmatters G.ed.p215
of this kind, estimated the average price of wheat in years of moderate
plentytobetothegrower3s.6d.thebushel,oreight-and-twentyshillings

issometimescalledthecontractprice, orthepriceatwhichafarmercon-
tractsforacertainnumberofyearstodeliveracertainquantityofcorntoa

of marketing, the contract price is generally lower than what is supposed
tobetheaveragemarketprice. Mr.Kinghadjudgedeight-and-twentyshil-
lingsthequartertobeatthattimetheordinarycontractpriceinyearsof
moderate plenty. Before the scarcity occasioned by the late extraordinary
course of bad seasons, it was, I have been assured, the ordinary contract
priceinallcommonyears.
503 [10] In 1688 was granted the Parliamentary bounty upon the exportation
of corn. The country gentlemen, who then composed a still greater pro-
portionofthelegislaturethantheydoatpresent,hadfeltthatthemoney
price of corn was falling. The bounty was an expedient to raise it artifi-
157 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ciallytothehighpriceatwhichithadfrequentlybeensoldinthetimesof
Charles I and II. It was to take place, therefore, till wheat was so high as
forty-eight shillings the quarter, that is, twenty shillings, or five-sevenths
dearerthanMr.Kinghadinthatveryyearestimatedthegrower’spriceto
be in times of moderate plenty. If his calculations deserve any part of the
reputationwhichtheyhaveobtainedveryuniversally,eight-and-fortyshil-
lings the quarter was a price which, without some such expedient as the
bounty,couldnotatthattimebeexpected,exceptinyearsofextraordinary
scarcity. But the government of King William was not then fully settled.
It was in no condition to refuse anything to the country gentlemen, from
whomitwasatthatverytimesolicitingthefirstestablishmentofthean-
nualland-tax.
504 [11] Thevalueofsilver,therefore,inproportiontothatofcorn,hadprobably
risen somewhat before the end of the last century; and it seems to have
continued to do so during the course of the greater part of the present;
though the necessary operation of the bounty must have hindered that
rise from being so sensible as it otherwise would have been in the actual G.ed.p216
stateoftillage.
505 [12] Inplentifulyearsthebounty,byoccasioninganextraordinaryexporta-
tion,necessarilyraisesthepriceofcornabovewhatitotherwisewouldbe
in those years. To encourage tillage, by keeping up the price of corn even
inthemostplentifulyears,wastheavowedendoftheinstitution.
506 [13] In years of great scarcity, indeed, the bounty has generally been sus-
pended. It must, however, have had some effect even upon the prices of
many of those years. By the extraordinary exportation which it occasions
in years of plenty, it must frequently hinder the plenty of one year from
compensatingthescarcityofanother.
507 [14] Both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity, therefore, the bounty
raises the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual
state of tillage. If, during the sixty-four first years of the present century,
therefore,theaveragepricehasbeenlowerthanduringthesixty-fourlast
years of the last century, it must, in the same state of tillage, have been
muchmoreso,haditnotbeenforthisoperationofthebounty.
508 [15] But without the bounty, it may be said, the state of tillage would not
have been the same. What may have been the effects of this institution
upon the agriculture of the country, I shall endeavour to explain here-
after, when I come to treat particularly of bounties. I shall only observe
atpresentthatthisriseinthevalueofsilver,inproportiontothatofcorn,
hasnotbeenpeculiartoEngland. Ithasbeenobservedtohavetakenplace
inFrance,duringthesameperiod,andnearlyinthesameproportiontoo,
by three very faithful, diligent, and laborious collectors of the prices of
corn,Mr.DuprèdeSt.Maur,Mr.Messance,andtheauthoroftheEssayon
the police of grain. But in France, till 1764, the exportation of grain was
by law prohibited; and it is somewhat difficult to suppose that nearly the
samediminutionofpricewhichtookplaceinonecountry,notwithstanding
158 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
this prohibition, should in another be owing to the extraordinary encour-
agementgiventoexportation.
509 [16] Itwouldbemoreproper,perhaps,toconsiderthisvariationintheaver-
agemoneypriceofcornastheeffectratherofsomegradualriseinthereal
valueofsilverintheEuropeanmarketthanofanyfallintherealaverage
value of corn. Corn, it has already been observed, is at distant periods
of time a more accurate measure of value than either silver, or perhaps
any other commodity. When, after the discovery of the abundant mines G.ed.p217
of America, corn rose to three and four times its former money price, this
change was universally ascribed, not to any rise in the real value of corn,
buttoafallintherealvalueofsilver. Ifduringthesixty-fourfirstyearsof
the present century, therefore, the average money price of corn has fallen
somewhat below what it had been during the greater part of the last cen-
tury,weshouldinthesamemannerimputethischange,nottoanyfallin

Europeanmarket.

bad seasons, though not a very common event, is by no means a singular
one; and whoever has inquired much into the history of the prices of corn
in former times will be at no loss to recollect several other examples of
the same kind. Ten years of extraordinary scarcity, besides, are not more
wonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty. The low price of corn
from 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very well be set in opposition to
itshighpriceduringtheselasteightortenyears. From1741to1750,the
average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at Windsor
market,itappearsfromtheaccountsofEtonCollege,wasonly1l.13s.9d.4,

which isnearly 6s.3d. below theaverage price ofthe sixty-four firstyears
of the present century. The average price of the quarter of eight bushels
ofmiddlewheatcomesout,accordingtothisaccount,tohavebeen,during
thesetenyears,only1l.6s.8d.
511 [18] Between 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have hindered the
priceofcornfromfallingsolowinthehomemarketasitnaturallywould
have done. During these ten years the quantity of all sorts of grain ex-
ported,itappearsfromthecustom-housebooks,amountedtonolessthan
eight millions twenty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty-six quarters
one bushel. The bounty paid for this amounted to 1,514,962l.17s.4d.1. In

1749accordingly,Mr.Pelham,atthattimePrimeMinister,observedtothe G.ed.p218
159 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
House of Commons that for the three years preceding a very extraordin-
arysumhadbeenpaidasbountyfortheexportationofcorn. Hehadgood
reason to make this observation, and in the following year he might have
had still better. In that single year the bounty paid amounted to no less
than 324,176l.10s.6d.5 It is unnecessary to observe how much this forced
exportation must have raised the price of corn above what it otherwise
wouldhavebeeninthehomemarket.
512 [19] Attheendoftheaccountsannexedtothischapterthereaderwillfind
the particular account of those ten years separated from the rest. He will
findthere, too, theparticularaccountoftheprecedingtenyears, ofwhich
the average is likewise below, though not so much below, the general av-
erage of the sixty-four first years of the century. The year 1740, however,
was a year of extraordinary scarcity. These twenty years preceding 1750
may very well be set in opposition to the twenty preceding 1770. As the

standingtheinterventionofoneortwodearyears;sothelatterhavebeen

ones, of 1759, for example. If the former have not been as much below
the general average as the latter have been above it, we ought probably
to impute it to the bounty. The change has evidently been too sudden to
be ascribed to any change in the value of silver, which is always slow and
gradual. Thesuddennessoftheeffectcanbeaccountedforonlybyacause
whichcanoperatesuddenly,theaccidentalvariationoftheseasons.
513 [20] The money price of labour in Great Britain has, indeed, risen during
the course of the present century. This, however, seems to be the effect,
notsomuchofanydiminutioninthevalueofsilverintheEuropeanmar- G.ed.p219
ket, as of an increase in the demand for labour in Great Britain, arising
fromthegreat,andalmostuniversalprosperityofthecountry. InFrance,

day-wagesofcommonlabouraretheresaidtohavebeenprettyuniformly
about the twentieth part of the average price of the septier of wheat, a
measure which contains a little more than four Winchester bushels. In
Great Britain the real recompense of labour, it has already been shown,
the real quantities of the necessaries and conveniencies of life which are
given to the labourer, has increased considerably during the course of the
present century. The rise in its money price seems to have been the ef-
fect, not of any diminution of the value of silver in the general market of
Europe,butofariseintherealpriceoflabourintheparticularmarketof
GreatBritain,owingtothepeculiarlyhappycircumstancesofthecountry.
514 [21] ForsometimeafterthefirstdiscoveryofAmerica,silverwouldcontinue

160 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
mining would for some time be very great, and much above their natural
rate. Those who imported that metal into Europe, however, would soon
find that the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at this
high price. Silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a smaller
quantity of goods. Its price would sink gradually lower and lower till it
fell to its natural price, or to what was just sufficient to pay, according to
their natural rates, the wages of the labour, the profits of the stock, and
therentoftheland,whichmustbepaidinordertobringitfromthemine

King of Spain, amounting to a tenth of the gross produce, eats up, it has
alreadybeenobserved,thewholerentoftheland. Thistaxwasoriginally
a half; it soon afterwards fell to a third, then to a fifth, and at last to a
tenth, at which rate it still continues. In the greater part of the silver
mines of Peru this, it seems, is all that remains after replacing the stock
of the undertaker of the work, together with its ordinary profits; and it
seems to be universally acknowledged that these profits, which were once
very high, are now as low as they can well be, consistently with carrying
ontheirworks.
515 [22] ThetaxoftheKingofSpainwasreducedtoafifthpartoftheregistered
silver in 15046, one-and-forty years before 1545, the date of the discovery G.ed.p220
of the mines of Potosi. In the course of ninety years, or before 1636, these
mines,themostfertileinallAmerica,hadtimesufficienttoproducetheir
full effect, or to reduce the value of silver in the European market as low
asitcouldwellfall,whileitcontinuedtopaythistaxtotheKingofSpain.
Ninety years is time sufficient to reduce any commodity, of which there is
no monopoly, to its natural price, or to the lowest price at which, while it
pays a particular tax, it can continue to be sold for any considerable time
together.
516 [23] The price of silver in the European market might perhaps have fallen
still lower, and it might have become necessary either to reduce the tax
upon it, not only to one tenth, as in 1736, but to one twentieth, in the
same manner as that upon gold, or to give up working the greater part
of the American mines which are now wrought. The gradual increase of
the demand for silver, or the gradual enlargement of the market for the
produce of the silver mines of America, is probably the cause which has
preventedthisfromhappening, andwhichhasnotonlykeptupthevalue

517 [24] Since the first discovery of America, the market for the produce of its
silvermineshasbeengrowinggraduallymoreandmoreextensive.
518 [25] First, the market of Europe has become gradually more and more ex-
tensive. Since the discovery of America, the greater part of Europe has
been much improved. England, Holland, France, and Germany; even
6[Smith]Solorzano,vol.ii.[Solorzano-Pereira,DeIndiarumJure(Madrid,1977),ii.883.]
161 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Sweden, Denmark, and Russia, have all advanced considerably both in
agricultureandinmanufactures. Italyseemsnottohavegonebackwards.
The fall of Italy preceded the conquest of Peru. Since that time it seems
rather to have recovered a little. Spain and Portugal, indeed, are sup-
posed to have gone backwards. Portugal, however, is but a very small
part of Europe, and the declension of Spain is not, perhaps, so great as
is commonly imagined. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain
wasaverypoorcountry, evenincomparisonwithFrance, whichhasbeen
so much improved since that time. It was the well known remark of the
Emperor Charles V, who had travelled so frequently through both coun-
tries, that everything abounded in France, but that everything was want-
inginSpain. Theincreasingproduceoftheagricultureandmanufactures

quires a continually augmenting supply of silver through a great contin-
ent where there never was any demand before. The greater part, too, of
the Spanish and Portuguese colonies are altogether new markets. New
Granada, the Yucatan, Paraguay, and the Brazils were, before discovered
by the Europeans, inhabited by savage nations who had neither arts nor
agriculture. A considerable degree of both has now been introduced into
all of them. Even Mexico and Peru, though they cannot be considered as
altogethernewmarkets,arecertainlymuchmoreextensiveonesthanthey
everwerebefore. Afterallthewonderfultaleswhichhavebeenpublished
concerningthesplendidstateofthosecountriesinancienttimes,whoever
reads, with any degree of sober judgment, the history of their first dis-
covery and conquest, will evidently discern that, in arts, agriculture, and
commerce, their inhabitants were much more ignorant than the Tartars
of the Ukraine are at present. Even the Peruvians, the more civilised na-
tion of the two, though they made use of gold and silver as ornaments,
had no coined money of any kind. Their whole commerce was carried on
by barter, and there was accordingly scarce any division of labour among
them. Those who cultivated the ground were obliged to build their own
houses, to make their own household furniture, their own cloaths, shoes,
and instruments of agriculture. The few artificers among them are said
to have been all maintained by the sovereign, the nobles, and the priests,
and were probably their servants or slaves. All the ancient arts of Mex-
icoandPeruhaveneverfurnishedonesinglemanufacturetoEurope. The
Spanish armies, though they scarce ever exceeded five hundred men, and
162 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
frequently did not amount to half that number, found almost everywhere
greatdifficultyinprocuringsubsistence. Thefamineswhichtheyaresaid
to have occasioned almost wherever they went, in countries, too, which
at the same time are represented as very populous and well cultivated,
sufficiently demonstrate that the story of this populousness and high cul-
tivation is in a great measure fabulous. The Spanish colonies are under
a government in many respects less favourable to agriculture, improve-
ment, and population than that of the English colonies. They seem, how- G.ed.p222
ever, to be advancing in all these much more rapidly than any country
in Europe. In a fertile soil and happy climate, the great abundance and

than fifty thousand. The difference in their accounts of the populousness
ofseveralotherprincipaltownsinChiliandPeruisnearlythesame; and
as there seems to be no reason to doubt of the good information of either,
it marks an increase which is scarce inferior to that of the English colon-
ies. America, therefore, is a new market for the produce of its own silver
mines, of which the demand must increase much more rapidly than that
ofthemostthrivingcountryinEurope.
520 [27] Thirdly,theEastIndiesisanothermarketfortheproduceofthesilver
mines of America, and a market which, from the time of the first discov-
eryofthosemines,hasbeencontinuallytakingoffagreaterandagreater
quantity of silver. Since that time, the direct trade between America and
the East Indies, which is carried on by means of the Acapulco ships, has
been continually augmenting, and the indirect intercourse by the way of
Europehasbeenaugmentinginastillgreaterproportion. Duringthesix-
teenth century, the Portuguese were the only European nation who car-
ried on any regular trade to the East Indies. In the last years of that
century the Dutch begun to encroach upon this monopoly, and in a few
yearsexpelledthemfromtheirprincipalsettlementsinIndia. Duringthe
greaterpartofthelastcenturythosetwonationsdividedthemostconsid-
erable part of the East India trade between them; the trade of the Dutch
continually augmenting in a still greater proportion than that of the Por- G.ed.p223
tuguese declined. The English and French carried on some trade with
India in the last century, but it has been greatly augmented in the course
ofthepresent. TheEastIndiatradeoftheSwedesandDanesbeganinthe
course of the present century. Even the Muscovites now trade regularly
with China by a sort of caravans which go overland through Siberia and
Tartary to Pekin. The East India trade of all these nations, if we except
thatoftheFrench,whichthelastwarhadwellnighannihilated,hadbeen
almostcontinuallyaugmenting. TheincreasingconsumptionofEastIndia
goods in Europe is, it seems, so great as to afford a gradual increase of
163 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
employment to them all. Tea, for example, was a drug very little used in
Europe before the middle of the last century. At present the value of the
tea annually imported by the English East India Company, for the use of
their own countrymen, amounts to more than a million and a half a year;
andeventhisisnotenough; agreatdealmorebeingconstantlysmuggled
into the country from the ports of Holland, from Gottenburgh in Sweden,
and from the coast of France too, as long as the French East India Com-
panywasinprosperity. TheconsumptionoftheporcelainofChina, ofthe
spiceriesoftheMoluccas,ofthepiecegoodsofBengal,andofinnumerable
otherarticles,hasincreasedverynearlyinalikeproportion. Thetonnage
accordinglyofalltheEuropeanshippingemployedintheEastIndiatrade,
at any one time during the last century, was not, perhaps, much greater
than that of the English East India Company before the late reduction of
theirshipping.
521 [28] But in the East Indies, particularly in China and Indostan, the value
of the precious metals, when the Europeans first began to trade to those
countries, was much higher than in Europe; and it still continues to be
so. In rice countries, which generally yield two, sometimes three crops in
the year, each of them more plentiful than any common crop of corn, the
abundanceoffoodmustbemuchgreaterthaninanycorncountryofequal
extent. Suchcountriesareaccordinglymuchmorepopulous. Inthem,too,
the rich, having a greater superabundance of food to dispose of beyond
whattheythemselvescanconsume,havethemeansofpurchasingamuch
greater quantity of the labour of other people. The retinue of a grandee
in China or Indostan accordingly is, by all accounts, much more numer-
ous and splendid than that of the richest subjects in Europe. The same
superabundance of food, of which they have the disposal, enables them to
give a greater quantity of it for all those singular and rare productions
which nature furnishes but in very small quantities; such as the precious G.ed.p224
metalsandthepreciousstones, thegreatobjectsofthecompetitionofthe
rich. Though the mines, therefore, which supplied the Indian market had
been as abundant as those which supplied the European, such commodit-
ies would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in India than
inEurope. ButthemineswhichsuppliedtheIndianmarketwiththepre-
ciousmetalsseemtohavebeenagooddeallessabundant,andthosewhich
supplied it with the precious stones a good deal more so, than the mines
which supplied the European. The precious metals, therefore, would nat-
urally exchange in India for somewhat a greater quantity of the precious
stones,andforamuchgreaterquantityoffoodthaninEurope. Themoney
price of diamonds, the greatest of all superfluities, would be somewhat
lower,andthatoffood,thefirstofallnecessaries,agreatdeallowerinthe
onecountrythanintheother. Buttherealpriceoflabour,therealquant-
ity of the necessaries of life which is given to the labourer, it has already
beenobserved,islowerbothinChinaandIndostan,thetwogreatmarkets

bouristhereloweruponadoubleaccount;uponaccountbothofthesmall
quantity of food which it will purchase, and of the low price of that food.
But in countries of equal art and industry, the money price of the greater
partofmanufactureswillbeinproportiontothemoneypriceoflabour;and
in manufacturing art and industry, China and Indostan, though inferior,
seemnottobemuchinferiortoanypartofEurope. Themoneypriceofthe
greater part of manufactures, therefore, will naturally be much lower in
those great empires than it is anywhere in Europe. Through the greater
partofEurope,too,theexpenseofland-carriageincreasesverymuchboth
the real and nominal price of most manufactures. It costs more labour,
andthereforemoremoney,tobringfirstthematerials,andafterwardsthe
complete manufacture to market. In China and Indostan the extent and
variety of inland navigation save the greater part of this labour, and con-
sequently of this money, and thereby reduce still lower both the real and
thenominalpriceofthegreaterpartoftheirmanufactures. Uponallthose
accounts the precious metals axe a commodity which it always has been,
andstillcontinuestobe,extremelyadvantageoustocarryfromEuropeto
India. There is scarce any commodity which brings a better price there;
or which, in proportion to the quantity of labour and commodities which
itcostsinEurope, willpurchaseorcommandagreaterquantityoflabour
and commodities in India. It is more advantageous, too, to carry silver
thitherthangold;becauseinChina,andthegreaterpartoftheothermar- G.ed.p225

oratmostastwelve, toone; whereasinEuropeitisasfourteenorfifteen

at most twelve, ounces of silver will purchase an ounce of gold; in Europe
itrequiresfromfourteentofifteenounces. Inthecargoes,therefore,ofthe
greater part of European ships which sail to India, silver has generally
been one of the most valuable articles. It is the most valuable article in
the Acapulco ships which sail to Manilla. The silver of the new continent
seemsinthismannertobeoneoftheprincipalcommoditiesbywhichthe
commerce between the two extremities of the old one is carried on, and it
isbymeansofit,inagreatmeasure,thatthosedistantpartsoftheworld
areconnectedwithoneanother.
522 [29] In order to supply so very widely extended a market, the quantity of
silverannuallybroughtfromtheminesmustnotonlybesufficienttosup-
port that continual increase both of coin and of plate which is required in
allthrivingcountries;buttorepairthatcontinualwasteandconsumption

523 [30] The continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing,
and in plate both by wearing and cleaning, is very sensible, and in com-
moditiesofwhichtheuseissoverywidelyextended,wouldalonerequirea
verygreatannualsupply. Theconsumptionofthosemetalsinsomepartic-
165 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ular manufactures, though it may not perhaps be greater upon the whole
than this gradual consumption, is, however, much more sensible, as it is
muchmorerapid. InthemanufacturesofBirminghamalonethequantity
of gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating, and thereby
disqualified from ever afterwards appearing in the shape of those metals,
is said to amount to more than fifty thousand pounds sterling. We may

in all the different parts of the world either in manufactures of the same
kind with those of Birmingham, or in laces, embroideries, gold and silver
stuffs, the gilding of books, furniture, etc. A considerable quantity, too,
must be annually lost in transporting those metals from one place to an-
other both by sea and by land. In the greater part of the governments of
Asia, besides, the almost universal custom of concealing treasures in the
bowels of the earth, of which the knowledge frequently dies with the per-
son who makes the concealment, must occasion the loss of a still greater
quantity.
524 [31] ThequantityofgoldandsilverimportedatbothCadizandLisbon(in-
cludingnotonlywhatcomesunderregister, butwhatmaybesupposedto

525 [32] According to Mr. Meggens7 the annual importation of the precious
metalsintoSpain,atanaverageofsixyears;viz. from1748to1753,both
inclusive;andintoPortugal,atanaverageofsevenyears,viz.,from1747to
1753,bothinclusive,amountedinsilverto1,101,107poundsweight;andin
gold to 49,940 pounds weight. The silver, at sixty-two shillings the pound
Troy, amounts to 3,413,431l.10s. sterling. The gold, at forty-four guineas
and a half the pound Troy, amounts to 2,333,446l.14s. sterling. Both to-
gether amount to 5,746,878l.4s. sterling. The account of what was impor-
ted under register he assures us is exact. He gives us the detail of the
particular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and of the

particular places from which the gold and silver were brought, and of the G.ed.p227
particular quantities of each metal which, according to the register, each

ity of gold annually imported from the Brazils into Lisbon by the amount
of the tax paid to the King of Portugal, which it seems is one-fifth of the
standard metal, we might value it at eighteen millions of cruzadoes, or
forty-five millions of French livres, equal to about two millions sterling.
On account of what may have been smuggled, however, we may safely,
he says, add to the sum an eighth more, or 250,000l. sterling, so that the
wholewillamountto2,250,000l.sterling. Accordingtothisaccount,there-

527 [34] Several other very well authenticated, though manuscript, accounts, I
havebeenassured,agreeinmakingthiswholeannualimportationamount
atanaveragetoaboutsixmillionssterling;sometimesalittlemore,some-
timesalittleless.
528 [35] The annual importation of the precious metals into Cadiz and Lisbon,
indeed, isnotequaltothewholeannualproduceoftheminesofAmerica.
SomepartissentannuallybytheAcapulcoshipstoManilla;somepartis
employedinthecontrabandtradewhichtheSpanishcoloniescarryonwith
those of other European nations; and some part, no doubt remains in the
country. TheminesofAmerica,besides,arebynomeanstheonlygoldand
silver mines in the world. They are, however, by far the most abundant.
The produce of all the other mines which are known is insignificant, it is
acknowledged,incomparisonwiththeirs;andthefargreaterpartoftheir
produce,itislikewiseacknowledged,isannuallyimportedintoCadizand
Lisbon. But the consumption of Birmingham alone, at the rate of fifty
thousandpoundsayear,isequaltothehundred-and-twentiethpartofthis
annual importation at the rate of six millions a year. The whole annual
consumption of gold and silver, therefore, in all the different countries of
theworldwherethosemetalsareused,mayperhapsbenearlyequaltothe G.ed.p228
whole annual produce. The remainder may be no more than sufficient to
supply the increasing demand of all thriving countries. It may even have
fallen so far short of time demand as somewhat to raise the price of those
metalsintheEuropeanmarket.
529 [36] The quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to the
market is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and silver. We
do not, however, upon this account, imagine that those coarse metals are
likelytomultiplybeyondthedemand,ortobecomegraduallycheaperand
cheaper. Whyshouldweimaginethatthepreciousmetalsarelikelytodo
so? Thecoarsemetals,indeed,thoughharder,areputtomuchharderuses,
and, as they are of less value, less care is employed in their preservation.
Thepreciousmetals,however,arenotnecessarilyimmortalanymorethan

530 [37] The price of all metals, though liable to slow and gradual variations,
varieslessfromyeartoyearthanthatofalmostanyotherpartoftherude

suddenvariationsthanthatofthecoarseones. Thedurablenessofmetals

mines of those two years; and the proportion between the masses of gold

VariationsintheProportionbetweentherespective
ValuesofGoldandSilver
531 [1] BeforethediscoveryoftheminesofAmerica,thevalueoffinegoldtofine
silver was regulated in the different mints of Europe between the propor-
tions of one to ten and one to twelve; that is, an ounce of fine gold was
supposed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine silver. About the G.ed.p229
middleofthelastcenturyitcametoberegulated,betweentheproportions
of one to fourteen and one to fifteen; that is, an ounce of fine gold came to
besupposedtobeworthbetweenfourteenandfifteenouncesoffinesilver.
Goldroseinitsnominalvalue,orinthequantityofsilverwhichwasgiven
for it. Both metals sunk in their real value, or in the quantity of labour
which they could purchase; but silver sunk more than gold. Though both
the gold and silver mines of America exceeded in fertility all those which
hadeverbeenknownbefore,thefertilityofthesilvermineshad,itseems,
beenproportionablystillgreaterthanthatofthegoldones.
532 [2] The great quantities of silver carried annually from Europe to India
have, in some of the English settlements, gradually reduced the value of
that metal in proportion to gold. In the mint of Calcutta an ounce of fine
goldissupposedtobeworthfifteenouncesoffinesilver,inthesameman-
ner as in Europe. It is in the mint perhaps rated too high for the value
168 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
whichitbearsinthemarketofBengal. InChina,theproportionofgoldto
silver still continues as one to ten, or one to twelve. In Japan it is said to
beasonetoeight.
533 [3] The proportion between the quantities of gold and silver annually
imported into Europe, according to Mr. Meggens’s account, is as one to
twenty-twonearly;thatis,foroneounceofgoldthereareimportedalittle
more than twenty-two ounces of silver. The great quantity of silver sent
annually to the East Indies reduces, he supposes, the quantities of those
metals which remain in Europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or fif-
teen, the proportion of their values. The proportion between their values,
he seems to think, must necessarily be the same as that between their
quantities, and would therefore be as one to twenty-two, were it not for
thisgreaterexportationofsilver.
534 [4] Buttheordinaryproportionbetweentherespectivevaluesoftwocom-
moditiesisnotnecessarilythesameasthatbetweenthequantitiesofthem
which are commonly in the market. The price of an ox, reckoned at ten
guineas, is about threescore times the price of a lamb, reckoned at 3s.6d.
Itwouldbeabsurd,however,toinferfromthencethattherearecommonly G.ed.p230
inthe market threescorelambsfor one ox: and itwouldbe justasabsurd
toinfer,becauseanounceofgoldwillcommonlypurchasefromfourteento
fifteen ounces of silver, that there are commonly in the market only four-
teenorfifteenouncesofsilverforoneounceofgold.
535 [5] The quantity of silver commonly in the market, it is probable is much
greater in proportion to that of gold than the value of a certain quantity
of gold is to that of an equal quantity of silver. The whole quantity of a
cheap commodity brought to market is commonly not only greater, but of
greater value, than the whole quantity of a dear one. The whole quantity
of bread annually brought to market is not only greater, but of greater
value than the whole quantity of butcher’s meat; the whole quantity of
butcher’smeat,thanthewholequantityofpoultry;andthewholequantity
ofwildfowl. Therearesomanymorepurchasersforthecheapthanforthe

can commonly be disposed of. The whole quantity, therefore, of the cheap
commoditymustcommonlybegreaterinproportiontothewholequantity
ofthedearonethanthevalueofacertainquantityofthedearoneistothe
valueofanequalquantityofthecheapone. Whenwecomparetheprecious
metals with oneanother, silver is a cheapand gold a dear commodity. We
ought naturally to expect, therefore, that there should always be in the
market not only a greater quantity, but a greater value of silver than of
gold. Let any man who has a little of both compare his own silver with
his gold plate, and he will probably find that, not only the quantity, but
the value of the former greatly exceeds that of the latter. Many people,
besides, have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate, which, even
with those who have it, is generally confined to watchcases, snuff-boxes,
andsuchliketrinkets,ofwhichthewholeamountisseldomofgreatvalue.
169 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
IntheBritishcoin,indeed,thevalueofthegoldpreponderatesgreatly,but
itisnotsointhatofallcountries. Inthecoinofsomecountriesthevalue
ofthetwometalsisnearlyequal. IntheScotchcoin,beforetheunionwith
England, the gold preponderated very little, though it did somewhat8 as
it appears by the accounts of the mint. In the coin of many countries the
silver preponderates. In France, the largest sums are commonly paid in
thatmetal,anditistheredifficulttogetmoregoldthanwhatisnecessary
to carry about in your pocket. The superior value, however, of the silver
plate above that of the gold, which takes place in all countries, will much
morethancompensatethepreponderancyofthegoldcoinabovethesilver, G.ed.p231
whichtakesplaceonlyinsomecountries.
536 [6] Though,inonesenseoftheword,silveralwayshasbeen,andprobably
always will be, much cheaper than gold; yet in another sense gold may,
perhaps, in the present state of the Spanish market, be said to be some-
what cheaper than silver. A commodity may be said to be dear or cheap,
notonlyaccordingtotheabsolutegreatnessorsmallnessofitsusualprice,
butaccordingas thatpriceis moreorless above thelowestfor whichitis
possibletobringittomarketforanyconsiderabletimetogether. Thislow-
est price is that which barely replaces, with a moderate profit, the stock
whichmustbeemployedinbringingthecommoditythither. Itistheprice
which affords nothing to the landlord, of which rent makes not any com-
ponent part, but which resolves itself altogether into wages and profit.
But, in the present state of the Spanish market, gold is certainly some-
what nearer to this lowest price than silver. The tax of the King of Spain
upongoldisonlyone-twentiethpartofthestandardmetal,orfivepercent;
whereas his tax upon silver amounts to one-tenth part of it, or to ten per
cent. In these taxes too, it has already been observed, consists the whole
rent of the greater part of the gold and silver mines of Spanish America;
and that upon gold is still worse paid than that upon silver. The profits
of the undertakers of gold mines too, as they more rarely make a fortune,
must, in general, be still more moderate than those of the undertakers of
silver mines. The price of Spanish gold, therefore, as it affords both less
rent and less profit, must, in the Spanish market, be somewhat nearer to
the lowest price for which it is possible to bring it thither than the price
of Spanish silver. When all expenses are computed, the whole quantity of
the one metal, it would seem, cannot, in the Spanish market, be disposed
of so advantageously as the whole quantity of the other. The tax, indeed,
of the King of Portugal upon the gold of the Brazils is the same with the
ancienttaxoftheKingofSpainuponthesilverofMexicoandPeru;orone-
fifthpartofthestandardmetal. Itmay,therefore,beuncertainwhetherto
the general market of Europe the whole mass of American gold comes at

538 [8] Thoughitisnotveryprobablethatanypartofatax,whichisnotonly
imposed upon one of the most proper subjects of taxation, a mere luxury
and superfluity, but which affords so very important a revenue as the tax
uponsilver,willeverbegivenupaslongasitispossibletopayit; yetthe
sameimpossibilityofpayingit,whichin1736madeitnecessarytoreduce
it from one-fifth to one-tenth, may in time make it necessary to reduce it
still further; in the same manner as it made it necessary to reduce the
tax upon gold to one-twentieth. That the silver mines of Spanish Amer-
ica,likeallothermines,becomegraduallymoreexpensiveintheworking,
on account of the greater depths at which it is necessary to carry on the
works,andofthegreaterexpenseofdrawingoutthewaterandofsupply-
ingthemwithfreshairatthosedepths,isacknowledgedbyeverybodywho
hasinquiredintothestateofthosemines.
539 [9] These causes, which are equivalent to a growing scarcity of silver (for
a commodity may be said to grow scarcer when it becomes more difficult
and expensive to collect a certain quantity of it) must, in time, produce
one or other of the three following events. The increase of the expense
musteither,first,becompensatedaltogetherbyaproportionableincrease
in the price of the metal; or, secondly, it must be compensated altogether
by a proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver; or, thirdly, it must
be compensated partly by the one, and partly by the other of those two
expedients. This third event is very possible. As gold rose in its price in
proportion to silver, notwithstanding a great diminution of the tax upon
gold, so silver might rise in its price in proportion to labour and commod-
ities,notwithstandinganequaldiminutionofthetaxuponsilver.
540 [10] Such successive reductions of the tax, however, though they may not
preventaltogether,mustcertainlyretard,moreorless,theriseofthevalue G.ed.p233
ofsilverintheEuropeanmarket. Inconsequenceofsuchreductionsmany
mines may be wrought which could not be wrought before, because they
could not afford to pay the old tax; and the quantity of silver annually
brought to market must always be somewhat greater, and, therefore, the
value of any given quantity somewhat less, than it otherwise would have
been. In consequence of the reduction in 1736, the value of silver in the
Europeanmarket,thoughitmaynotatthisdaybelowerthanbeforethat
reduction,is,probably,atleasttenpercentlowerthanitwouldhavebeen
hadtheCourtofSpaincontinuedtoexacttheoldtax.
541 [11] That, notwithstanding this reduction, the value of silver has, during
thecourseofthepresentcentury,beguntorisesomewhatintheEuropean
market, the facts and arguments which have been alleged above dispose
me to believe, or more properly to suspect and conjecture; for the best
opinion which I can form upon this subject scarce, perhaps, deserves the
nameofbelief. Therise,indeed,supposingtherehasbeenany,hashitherto
171 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
beensoverysmallthatafterallthathasbeensaiditmay,perhaps,appear
to many people uncertain, not only whether this event has actually taken
place;butwhetherthecontrarymaynothavetakenplace,orwhetherthe
valueofthesilvermaynotstillcontinuetofallintheEuropeanmarket.
542 [12] It must be observed, however, that whatever may be the supposed an-
nualimportationofgoldandsilver,theremustbeacertainperiodatwhich
the annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that annual im-
portation. Their consumption must increase as their mass increases, or
rather in a much greater proportion. As their mass increases, their value
diminishes. Theyaremoreusedandlesscaredfor,andtheirconsumption
consequently increases in a greater proportion than their mass. After a
certain period, therefore, the annual consumption of those metals must,
in this manner, become equal to their annual importation, provided that
importation is not continually increasing; which, in the present times, is
notsupposedtobethecase.
543 [13] If, when the annual consumption has become equal to the annual im-
portation, the annual importation should gradually diminish, the annual
consumptionmay,forsometime,exceedtheannualimportation. Themass
of those metals may gradually and insensibly diminish, and their value
gradually and insensibly rise, till the annual importation become again
stationary, the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly accom-
modateitselftowhatthatannualimportationcanmaintain.

Produce
547 [1] These different sorts of rude produce may be divided into three classes.
The first comprehends those which it is scarce in the power of human
industry to multiply at all. The second, those which it can multiply in
proportiontothedemand. Thethird,thoseinwhichtheefficacyofindustry G.ed.p235

ferent accidents render the efforts of human industry, in multiplying this
sortofrudeproduce,moreorlesssuccessful.
FirstSort
548 [1] The first sort of rude produce of which the price rises in the progress of
improvement is that which it is scarce in the power of human industry
to multiply at all. It consists in those things which nature produces only
in certain quantities, and which, being of a very perishable nature, it is
impossible to accumulate together the produce of many different seasons.
Such are the greater part of rare and singular birds and fishes, many dif-
ferent sorts of game, almost all wild-fowl, all birds of passage in partic-
ular, as well as many other things. When wealth and the luxury which
accompanies it increase, the demand for these is likely to increase with
them, and no effort of human industry may be able to increase the sup-
ply much beyond what it was before this increase of the demand. The
quantity of such commodities, therefore, remaining the same, or nearly
the same, while the competition to purchase them is continually increas-
173 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ing, their price may rise to any degree of extravagance, and seems not to
be limited by any certain boundary. If woodcocks should become so fash-
ionable as to sell for twenty guineas apiece, no effort of human industry
could increase the number of those brought to market much beyond what
it is at present. The high price paid by the Romans, in the time of their
greatest grandeur, for rare birds and fishes, may in this manner easily be
accounted for. These prices were not the effects of the low value of silver
inthosetimes,butofthehighvalueofsuchraritiesandcuriositiesashu-
man industry could not multiply at pleasure. The real value of silver was
higher at Rome, for some time before and after the fall of the republic,
than it is through the greater part of Europe at present. Three sestertii,
equaltoaboutsixpencesterling,wasthepricewhichtherepublicpaidfor
the modius or peck of the tithe wheat of Sicily. This price, however, was
probably below the average market price, the obligation to deliver their
wheat at this rate being considered as a tax upon the Sicilian farmers.
When the Romans, therefore, had occasion to order more corn than the G.ed.p236
titheofwheatamountedto,theywereboundbycapitulationtopayforthe
surplus at the rate of four sestertii, or eightpence sterling, the peck; and
thishadprobablybeenreckonedthemoderateandreasonable,thatis,the
ordinary or average contract price of those times; it is equal to about one-
and-twenty shillings the quarter. Eight-and-twenty shillings the quarter
was,beforethelateyearsofscarcity,theordinarycontractpriceofEnglish
wheat, which in quality is inferior to the Sicilian, and generally sells for
a lower price in the European market. The value of silver, therefore, in
thoseancienttimes,musthavebeentoitsvalueinthepresentasthreeto
four inversely; that is, three ounces of silver would then have purchased
the same quantity of labour and commodities which four ounces will do
at present. When we read in Pliny, therefore, that Seius9 bought a white
nightingale,asapresentfortheEmpressAgrippina,atapriceofsixthou-
sand sestertii, equal to about fifty pounds of our present money; and that
Asinius Celer10 purchased a surmullet at the price of eight thousand ses-
tertii, equal to about sixty-six pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence of
our present money, the extravagance of those prices, how much soever it
may surprise us, is apt, notwithstanding, to appear to us about one-third
less than it really was. Their real price, the quantity of labour and sub-
sistence which was given away for them, was about one-third more than
theirnominalpriceisapttoexpresstousinthepresenttimes. Seiusgave
for the nightingale the command of a quantity of labour and subsistence
equal to what 66l.13s.4d. would purchase in the present times; and Asin-
iusCelergaveforthesurmulletthecommandofaquantityequaltowhat
88l.17s91d. would purchase. What occasioned the extravagance of those

high prices was, not so much the abundance of silver as the abundance

SecondSort
549 [1] Thesecondsortofrudeprocedureofwhichthepricerisesintheprogressof
improvement is that which human industry can multiply in proportion to
the demand. It consists in those useful plants and animals which, in un-
cultivated countries, nature produces with such profuse abundance that
theyareoflittleornovalue,andwhich,ascultivationadvancesarethere-
fore forced to give place to some more profitable produce. During a long
periodintheprogressofimprovement,thequantityoftheseiscontinually
diminishing, while at the same time the demand for them is continually
increasing. Their real value, therefore, the real quantity of labour which
they will purchase or command, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high
as to render them as profitable a produce as anything else which human
industry can raise upon the most fertile and best cultivated land. When
it has got so high it cannot well go higher. If it did, more land and more
industrywouldsoonbeemployedtoincreasetheirquantity.
550 [2] When the price of cattle, for example, rises so high that it is as profit-

But it must always be late in the progress of improvement before tillage
can be so far extended as to raise the price of cattle to this height; and
till it has got to this height, if the country is advancing at all, their price
must be continually rising. There are, perhaps, some parts of Europe in
which the price of cattle has not yet got to this height. It had not got to
thisheightinanypartofScotlandbeforetheunion. HadtheScotchcattle

composethissecondsortofrudeproduce, cattleis, perhaps, thatofwhich

551 [3] Till the price of cattle, indeed, has got to this height, it seems scarce
possiblethatthegreaterpart,evenofthoselandswhicharecapableofthe
highest cultivation, can be completely cultivated. In all farms too distant
from any town to carry manure from it, that is, in the far greater part of
thoseofeveryextensivecountry,thequantityofwell-cultivatedlandmust
beinproportiontothequantityofmanurewhichthefarmitselfproduces;
andthisagainmustbeinproportiontothestockofcattlewhicharemain-
tained upon it. The land is manured either by pasturing the cattle upon
it, or by feeding them in the stable, and from thence carrying out their
dung to it. But unless the price of the cattle be sufficient to pay both the
rentandprofitofcultivatedland,thefarmercannotaffordtopasturethem

In these circumstances, therefore, no more cattle can, with profit, be fed
in the stable than what are necessary for tillage. But these can never af-

which they are capable of cultivating. What they afford being insufficient

kept constantly in good condition and fit for tillage. The rest will, the
greater part of them, be allowed to lie waste, producing scarce anything
but some miserable pasture, just sufficient to keep alive a few straggling,
half-starved cattle; the farm, though much understocked in proportion to G.ed.p239
whatwouldbenecessaryforitscompletecultivation,beingveryfrequently
overstocked in proportion to its actual produce. A portion of this waste
land,however,afterhavingbeenpasturedinthiswretchedmannerforsix
or seven years together, may be ploughed up, when it will yield, perhaps,
a poor crop or two of bad oats, or of some other coarse grain, and then,
being entirely exhausted, it must be rested and pastured again as before

If, notwithstanding a great rise in their price, it still continues to prevail
throughaconsiderablepartofthecountry, itisowing, inmanyplaces, no
doubt, to ignorance and attachment to old customs, but in most places to
the unavoidable obstructions which the natural course of things opposes
to the immediate or speedy establishment of a better system: first, to the
poverty of the tenants, to their not having yet had time to acquire a stock

price which would render it advantageous for them to maintain a greater
stock rendering it more difficult for them to acquire it; and, secondly, to
their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to maintain
this greater stock properly, supposing they were capable of acquiring it.
The increase of stock and the improvement of land are two events which
mustgohandinhand,andofwhichtheonecannowheremuchoutrunthe
other. Without some increase of stock there can be scarce any improve-
ment of land, but there can be no considerable increase of stock but in

pass away before the old system, which is wearing out gradually, can be
completely abolished through all the different parts of the country. Of all

552 [4] In all new colonies the great quantity of waste land, which can for
many years be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle, soon
renders them extremely abundant, and in everything great cheapness is
the necessary consequence of great abundance. Though all the cattle of
the European colonies in America were originally carried from Europe,
theysoonmultipliedsomuchthere,andbecameofsolittlevaluethateven
horseswereallowedtorunwildinthewoodswithoutanyownerthinkingit

the produce of cultivated land. The same causes, therefore, the want of
manure,andthedisproportionbetweenthestockemployedincultivation,
177 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
andthelandwhichitisdestinedtocultivate,arelikelytointroducethere
a system of husbandry not unlike that which still continues to take place
in so many parts of Scotland. Mr. Kalm, the Swedish traveller, when he
givesanaccountofthehusbandryofsomeoftheEnglishcoloniesinNorth
America, as he found it in 1749, observes, accordingly, that he can with
difficultydiscovertherethecharacteroftheEnglishnation,sowellskilled
inallthedifferentbranchesofagriculture. Theymakescarceanymanure
for their corn fields, he says; but when one piece of ground has been ex-
hausted by continual cropping, they clear and cultivate another piece of
fresh land; and when that is exhausted, proceed to the third. Their cattle G.ed.p241

years ago, and which is now so much mended through the greater part of

ent has been employed in some places, as by a more plentiful method of
feedingthem.
553 [5] Thoughitislate,therefore,intheprogressofimprovementbeforecattle
can bring such a price as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the
sake of feeding them; yet of all the different parts which compose this
second sort of rude produce, they are perhaps the first which bring this

in the course of which many other sorts of rude produce gradually arrive
at their highest price, some sooner and some later, according to different
circumstances.
556 [8] Thus in every farm the offals of the barn and stables will maintain a
certain number of poultry. These, as they are fed with what would oth-
erwise be lost, are a mere save-all; and as they cost the farmer scarce
anything, so he can afford to sell them for very little. Almost all that
he gets is pure gain, and their price can scarce be so low as to discour-
age him from feeding this number. But in countries ill cultivated, and
therefore but thinly inhabited, the poultry, which are thus raised without
expense, are often fully sufficient to supply the whole demand. In this
state of things, therefore, they are often as cheap as butcher’s meat, or
any other sort of animal food. But the whole quantity of poultry, which
the farmin this mannerproduces without expense, must always bemuch
smaller than the whole quantity of butcher’s meat which is reared upon
it; and in times of wealth and luxury what is rare, with only nearly equal
merit, is always preferred to what is common. As wealth and luxury in-
crease,therefore,inconsequenceofimprovementandcultivation,theprice
of poultry gradually rises above that of butcher’s meat, till at last it gets
so high that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the sake of feed-
ing them. When it has got to this height it cannot well go higher. If it
did,morelandwouldsoonbeturnedtothispurpose. Inseveralprovinces
of France, the feeding of poultry is considered as a very important article
in rural economy, and sufficiently profitable to encourage the farmer to
raise a considerable quantity of Indian corn and buck-wheat for this pur-
pose. A middling farmer will there sometimes have four hundred fowls
in his yard. The feeding of poultry seems scarce yet to be generally con-
sideredasamatterofsomuchimportanceinEngland. Theyarecertainly,
however, dearer in England than in France, as England receives consid-
erable supplies from France. In the progress of improvement, the period
atwhicheveryparticularsortofanimalfoodisdearestmustnaturallybe
that which immediately precedes the general practice of cultivating land
for the sake of raising it. For some time before this practice becomes gen-
eral,thescarcitymustnecessarilyraisetheprice. Afterithasbecomegen- G.ed.p243
eral, new methods of feeding are commonly fallen upon, which enable the
farmertoraiseuponthesamequantityofgroundamuchgreaterquantity
of that particular sort of animal food. The plenty not only obliges him to
sell cheaper, but in consequence of these improvements he can afford to
179 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
sell cheaper; for if he could not afford it, the plenty would not be of long
continuance. Ithasbeenprobablyinthismannerthattheintroductionof
clover, turnips, carrots, cabbage, etc., has contributed to sink the common
priceofbutcher’smeatintheLondonmarketsomewhatbelowwhatitwas
aboutthebeginningofthelastcentury.
557 [9] The hog, that finds his food among ordure and greedily devours many
things rejected by every other useful animal, is, like poultry, originally
keptasasave-all. Aslongasthenumberofsuchanimals,whichcanthus
be reared at little or no expense, is fully sufficient to supply the demand,
this sort of butcher’s meat comes to market at a much lower price than
any other. But when the demand rises beyond what this quantity can
supply, when it becomes necessary to raise food on purpose for feeding
andfatteninghogs,inthesamemannerasforfeedingandfatteningother
cattle, the price necessarily rises, and becomes proportionably higher or
lower than that of other butcher’s meat, according as the nature of the
country, and the state of its agriculture, happen to render the feeding of
hogsmoreorlessexpensivethanthatofothercattle. InFrance,according
toMr.Buffon,thepriceofporkisnearlyequaltothatofbeef. Inmostparts

558 [10] ThegreatriseinthepriceofbothhogsandpoultryhasinGreatBritain

other small occupiers of land; an event which has in every part of Europe
beentheimmediateforerunnerofimprovementandbettercultivation,but
which at the same time may have contributed to raise the price of those
articles both somewhat sooner and somewhat faster than it would other-
wise have risen. As the poorest family can often maintain a cat or a dog
withoutanyexpense,sothepoorestoccupiersoflandcancommonlymain-
tainafewpoultry,orasowandafewpigs,atverylittle. Thelittleoffalsof
their own table, their whey, skimmed milk, and buttermilk, supply those
animals with a part of their food, and they find the rest in the neighbour-
ing fields without doing any sensible damage to anybody. By diminishing G.ed.p244

provisions, which is thus produced at little or no expense, must certainly
havebeenagooddealdiminished,andtheirpricemustconsequentlyhave

Sooner or later, however, in the progress of improvement, it must at any
rate have risen to the utmost height to which it is capable of rising; or to
thepricewhichpaysthelabourandexpenseofcultivatingthelandwhich

559 [11] The business of the dairy, like the feeding of hogs and poultry, is ori-
ginallycarriedonasasave-all. Thecattlenecessarilykeptuponthefarm
produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young or the con-
sumption of the farmer’s family requires; and they produce most at one
particular season. But of all the productions of land, milk is perhaps the
180 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
most perishable. In the warm season, when it is most abundant, it will
scarce keep four-and-twenty hours. The farmer, by making it into fresh
butter,storesasmallpartofitforaweek: bymakingitintosaltbutter,for

employsomeofthemostfertileandbestcultivatedlandsinfeedingcattle

cannot well go higher. If it did, more land would soon be turned to this

The inferiority of the quality, indeed, compared with that of the produce
of English dairies, is fully equal to that of the price. But this inferiority
of quality is, perhaps, rather the effect of this lowness of price than the
cause of it. Though the quality was much better, the greater part of what

ity of wool or of raw hides, for example, which any country can afford is
necessarily limited by the number of great and small cattle that are kept

564 [3] The same causes which, in the progress of improvement, gradually
raise the price of butcher’s meat, should have the same effect, it may be
thought,uponthepricesofwoolandrawhides,andraisethem,too,nearly

565 [4] The market for butcher’s meat is almost everywhere confined to the
country which produces it. Ireland, and some part of British America in-
deed, carry on a considerable trade in salt provisions; but they are, I be-
lieve, the only countries in the commercial world which do so, or which
exporttoothercountriesanyconsiderablepartoftheirbutcher’smeat.
566 [5] Themarketforwoolandrawhides,onthecontrary,isintherudebegin-

any preparation, and raw hides with very little: and as they are the ma-

ernhalfoftheisland)hadgivensomevaluetothecattleoftheSpaniards,

568 [7] Thoughintheprogressofimprovementandpopulationthepriceofthe
whole beast necessarily rises, yet the price of the carcase is likely to be
much more affected by this rise than that of the wool and the hide. The
marketforthecarcase,beingintherudestateofsocietyconfinedalwaysto
thecountrywhichproducesit,mustnecessarilybeextendedinproportion
183 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to the improvement and population of that country. But the market for
the wool and the hides even of a barbarous country often extending to
the whole commercial world, it can very seldom be enlarged in the same
proportion. The state of the whole commercial world can seldom be much
affected by the improvement of any particular country; and the market
for such commodities may remain the same or very nearly the same after
such improvements as before. It should, however, in the natural course
of things rather upon the whole be somewhat extended in consequence of
them. Ifthemanufactures,especially,ofwhichthosecommoditiesarethe
materials should ever come to flourish in the country, the market, though
it might not be much enlarged, would at least be brought much nearer to
the place of growth than before; and the price of those materials might at
least be increased by what had usually been the expense of transporting
them to distant countries. Though it might not rise therefore in the same G.ed.p248
proportion as that of butcher’s meat, it ought naturally to rise somewhat,
anditoughtcertainlynottofall.
569 [8] InEngland,however,notwithstandingtheflourishingstateofitswool-
len manufacture, the price of English wool has fallen very considerably
since the time of Edward III. There are many authentic records which
demonstrate that during the reign of that prince (towards the middle of
the fourteenth century, or about 1339) what was reckoned the moderate
and reasonable price of the tod, or twenty-eight pounds of English wool,
was not less than ten shillings of the money of those times12, containing
at the rate of twentypence the ounce, six ounces of silver Tower weight,
equaltoaboutthirtyshillingsofourpresentmoney. Inthepresenttimes,
one-and-twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a good price for very
good English wool. The money-price of wool, therefore, in the time of Ed-
wardIII,wastoitsmoney-priceinthepresenttimesastentoseven. The
superiorityofitsrealpricewasstillgreater. Attherateofsixshillingsand

571 [10] I have not been able to find any such authentic records concerning the
price of raw hides in ancient times. Wool was commonly paid as a sub-
sidy to the king, and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains, at least in
somedegree,whatwasitsordinaryprice. Butthisseemsnottohavebeen
the case with raw hides. Fleetwood, however, from an account in 1425,
betweenthepriorofBurcesterOxfordandoneofhiscanons,givesustheir
price, at least as it was stated upon that particular occasion, viz., five ox
hidesattwelveshillings;fivecowhidesatsevenshillingsandthreepence;
thirty-six sheep skins of two years old at nine shillings; sixteen calves
skinsattwoshillings. In1425, twelveshillingscontainedaboutthesame
quantityofsilverasfour-and-twentyshillingsofourpresentmoney. Anox
hide, therefore, was in this account valued at the same quantity of silver
as 4s.4ths of our present money. Its nominal price was a good deal lower
5
thanatpresent. Butattherateofsixshillingsandeightpencethequarter,
twelveshillingswouldinthosetimeshavepurchasedfourteenbushelsand
four-fifths of a bushel of wheat, which, at three and sixpence the bushel,
would in the present times cost 51s.4d. An ox hide, therefore, would in
thosetimes havepurchasedas muchcorn asten shillings andthreepence G.ed.p250
would purchase at present. Its real value was equal to ten shillings and
threepence of our present money. In those ancient times, when the cattle
werehalfstarvedduringthegreaterpartofthewinter,wecannotsuppose
that they were of a very large size. An ox hide which weighs four stone
of sixteen pounds avoirdupois is not in the present times reckoned a bad
one;andinthoseancienttimeswouldprobablyhavebeenreckonedavery
good one. But at half-a-crown the stone, which at this moment (February
1773) I understand to be the common price, such a hide would at present
costonlytenshillings. Thoughitsnominalprice,therefore,ishigherinthe
present than it was in those ancient times, its real price, the real quant-
ityofsubsistencewhichitwillpurchaseorcommand, israthersomewhat
lower. The price of cow hides, as stated in the above account, is nearly in
the common proportion to that of ox hides. That of sheep skins is a good
deal above it. They had probably been sold with the wool. That of calves
skins, on the contrary, is greatly below it. In countries where the price of
cattle is very low, the calves, which are not intended to be reared in order
to keep up the stock, are generally killed very young; as was the case in
185 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Scotland twenty or thirty years ago. It saves the milk, which their price
wouldnotpayfor. Theirskins,therefore,arecommonlygoodforlittle.
572 [11] Thepriceofrawhidesisagooddealloweratpresentthanitwasafew
years ago, owing probably to the taking off the duty upon sealskins, and
to the allowing, for a limited time, the importation of raw hides from Ire-
landandfromtheplantationsdutyfree,whichwasdonein1769. Takethe
whole of the present century at an average, their real price has probably
been somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times. The nature of

of raw hides has, indeed, been prohibited, and declared a nuisance; but
theirimportationfromforeigncountrieshasbeensubjectedtoaduty;and
though this duty has been taken off from those of Ireland and the plant-

573 [12] Whatever regulations tend to sink the price either of wool or of raw
hides below what it naturally would be must, in an improved and cultiv-
atedcountry,havesometendencytoraisethepriceofbutcher’smeat. The
price both of the great and small cattle, which are fed on improved and
cultivatedland, must besufficienttopay therentwhich thelandlordand
the profit which the farmer has reason to expect from improved and cul-
tivatedland. Ifitisnot,theywillsoonceasetofeedthem. Whateverpart
of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid
by the carcase. The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid
fortheother. Inwhatmannerthispriceistobedivideduponthedifferent

therefore,wouldbethesameasbefore. Thewholepriceofcattlewouldfall, G.ed.p252
and along with it both the rent and the profit of all those lands of which
cattle was the principal produce, that is, of the greater part of the lands
ofthecountry. Theperpetualprohibitionoftheexportationofwool,which
is commonly, but very falsely, ascribed to Edward III, would, in the then
circumstances of the country, have been the most destructive regulation
whichcouldwellhavebeenthoughtof. Itwouldnotonlyhavereducedthe
actual value of the greater part of the lands of the kingdom, but by redu-
cing the price of the most important species of small cattle it would have

574 [13] The wool of Scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence
oftheunionwithEngland,bywhichitwasexcludedfromthegreatmarket
of Europe, and confined to the narrow one of Great Britain. The value of
the greater part of the lands in the southern counties of Scotland, which
are chiefly a sheep country, would have been very deeply affected by this
event,hadnottheriseinthepriceofbutcher’smeatfullycompensatedthe

575 [14] As the efficacy of human industry, in increasing the quantity either of
wool or of raw hides, is limited, so far as it depends upon the produce of
thecountrywhereitisexerted;soitisuncertainsofarasitdependsupon

they are altogether independent of domestic industry, so they necessarily

mostremotefromtheminesmustbemoreorlessaffectedbythisfertility G.ed.p254
or barrenness, on account of the easy and cheap transportation of those
metals, of their small bulk and great value. Their quantity in China and
188 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Indostan must have been more or less affected by the abundance of the
minesofAmerica.
580 [19] So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the
former of those two circumstances (the power of purchasing), their real
price,likethatofallotherluxuriesandsuperfluities,islikelytorisewith
the wealth and improvement of the country, and to fall with its poverty
anddepression. Countrieswhichhaveagreatquantityoflabourandsub-
sistence to spare can afford to purchase any particular quantity of those
metalsattheexpenseofagreaterquantityoflabourandsubsistencethan
countrieswhichhavelesstospare.
581 [20] So far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the
latter of those two circumstances (the fertility or barrenness of the mines
which happen to supply the commercial world), their real price, the real
quantity of labour and subsistence which they will purchase or exchange
for, will, no doubt, sink more or less in proportion to the fertility, and rise
inproportiontothebarrennessofthosemines.
582 [21] The fertility or barrenness of the mines, however, which may happen
at any particular time to supply the commercial world, is a circumstance
which, it is evident, may have no sort of connection with the state of in-
dustry in a particular country. It seems even to have no very necessary
connection with that of the world in general. As arts and commerce, in-
deed,graduallyspreadthemselvesoveragreaterandagreaterpartofthe
earth,thesearchfornewmines,beingextendedoverawidersurface,may
have somewhat a better chance for being successful than when confined
within narrower bounds. The discovery of new mines, however, as the old
ones come to be gradually exhausted, is a matter of the greatest uncer-
tainty,andsuchasnohumanskillorindustrycanensure. Allindications,
it is acknowledged, are doubtful, and the actual discovery and successful
workingofanewminecanaloneascertaintherealityofitsvalue,oreven
of its existence. In this search there seem to be no certain limits either to
the possible success or to the possible disappointment of human industry.
In the course of a century or two, it is possible that new mines may be
discovered more fertile than any that have ever yet been known; and it is
justequallypossiblethemostfertileminethenknownmaybemorebarren

but its real value, the real quantity of labour which it could purchase or

represent no more labour than a penny does at present; and a penny in
the other might represent as much as a shilling does now. But in the one
case he who had a shilling in his pocket would be no richer than he who

ConclusionoftheDigressionconcerningthe
VariationsintheValueofSilver
583 [1] The greater part of the writers who have collected the money prices of
things in ancient times seem to have considered the low money-price of
corn,andofgoodsingeneral,or,inotherwords,thehighvalueofgoldand
silver,asaproof,notonlyofthescarcityofthosemetals,butofthepoverty
andbarbarismofthecountryatthetimewhenittookplace. Thisnotionis
connectedwiththesystemofpoliticaleconomywhichrepresentsnational
wealthasconsistingintheabundance,andnationalpovertyinthescarcity
ofgoldandsilver; asystemwhichIshallendeavourtoexplainandexam-
ine at great length in the fourth book of this inquiry. I shall only observe
atpresentthatthehighvalueofthepreciousmetalscanbenoproofofthe
poverty or barbarism of any particular country at the time when it took
place. It is a proof only of the barrenness of the mines which happened
at that time to supply the commercial world. A poor country, as it cannot
affordtobuymore,soitcanaslittleaffordtopaydearerforgoldandsilver
thanarichone;andthevalueofthosemetals,therefore,isnotlikelytobe
higher in the former than in the latter. In China, a country much richer
than any part of Europe, the value of the precious metals is much higher
thaninanypartofEurope. AsthewealthofEurope,indeed,hasincreased
greatlysincethediscoveryoftheminesofAmerica,sothevalueofgoldand
silver has gradually diminished. This diminution of their value, however,
hasnotbeenowingtotheincreaseoftherealwealthofEurope,ofthean-
nualproduceofitslandandlabour,buttotheaccidentaldiscoveryofmore
abundant mines than any that were known before. The increase of the
quantityofgoldandsilverinEurope,andtheincreaseofitsmanufactures
andagriculture,aretwoeventswhich,thoughtheyhavehappenednearly
aboutthesametime,yethavearisenfromverydifferentcauses,andhave
scarce any natural connection with one another. The one has arisen from G.ed.p256
a mere accident, in which neither prudence nor policy either had or could
haveanyshare. Theotherfromthefallofthefeudalsystem,andfromthe

agement which it requires, some tolerable security that it shall enjoy the

eryofAmerica. Themoneypriceofcorn,however,hasrisen;therealvalue

190 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
partsofEurope. Theirquantity,therefore,musthaveincreasedthereasin
other places, and nearly in the same proportion to the annual produce of
itslandandlabour. Thisincreaseofthequantityofthosemetals,however,
has not, it seems, increased that annual produce, has neither improved
the manufactures and agriculture of the country, nor mended the circum-
stancesofitsinhabitants. SpainandPortugal,thecountrieswhichpossess
the mines, are, after Poland, perhaps, the two most beggarly countries in
Europe. Thevalueofthepreciousmetals,however,mustbelowerinSpain
and Portugal than in any other part of Europe; as they come from those
countries to all other parts of Europe, loaded, not only with a freight and
an insurance, but with the expense of smuggling, their exportation be-
ing either prohibited, or subjected to a duty. In proportion to the annual
produce of the land and labour, therefore, their quantity must be greater
inthosecountriesthaninanyotherpartofEurope. Thosecountries,how-
ever,arepoorerthanthegreaterpartofEurope. Thoughthefeudalsystem
has been abolished in Spain and Portugal, it has not been succeeded by a
muchbetter.
584 [2] As the low value of gold and silver, therefore, is no proof of the wealth
andflourishingstateofthecountrywhereittakesplace;soneitheristheir
highvalue,orthelowmoneypriceeitherofgoodsingeneral,orofcornin
particular,anyproofofitspovertyandbarbarism.
585 [3] But though the low money price either of goods in general, or of corn
in particular, be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times, the
low money price of some particular sorts of goods, such as cattle, poultry,
game of all kinds, etc., in proportion to that of corn, is a most decisive G.ed.p257
one. It clearly demonstrates, first, their great abundance in proportion
to that of corn, and consequently the great extent of the land which they
occupiedinproportiontowhatwasoccupiedbycorn;and,secondly,thelow
valueofthislandinproportiontothatofcornland, andconsequentlythe
uncultivated and unimproved state of the far greater part of the lands of
the country. It clearly demonstrates that the stock and population of the
countrydidnotbearthesameproportiontotheextentofitsterritorywhich
theycommonlydoincivilisedcountries,andthatsocietywasatthattime,
and in that country, but in its infancy. From the high or low money price
either of goods in general, or of corn in particular, we can infer only that
the mines which at that time happened to supply the commercial world
with gold and silver were fertile or barren, not that the country was rich
or poor. But from the high or low money price of some sorts of goods in
proportiontothatofothers,wecaninfer,withadegreeofprobabilitythat
approaches almost to certainty, that it was rich or poor, that the greater

586 [4] Any rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from
thedegradationofthevalueofsilverwouldaffectallsortsofgoodsequally,

191 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
according as silver happened to lose a third, or a fourth, or a fifth part of
itsformervalue. Buttheriseinthepriceofprovisions,whichhasbeenthe
subject of so much reasoning and conversation, does not affect all sorts of
provisionsequally. Takingthecourseofthepresentcenturyatanaverage,
the price of corn, it is acknowledged, even by those who account for this
risebythedegradationofthevalueofsilver,hasrisenmuchlessthanthat
ofsomeothersortsofprovisions. Theriseinthepriceofthoseothersorts
of provisions, therefore, cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of
the value of silver. Some other causes must be taken into the account,
and those which have been above assigned will, perhaps, without having
recourse to the supposed degradation of the value of silver, sufficiently
explain this rise in those particular sorts of provisions of which the price
hasactuallyriseninproportiontothatofcorn.
587 [5] As to the price of corn itself, it has, during the sixty-four first years
of the present century, and before the late extraordinary course of bad
seasons,beensomewhatlowerthanitwasduringthesixty-fourlastyears
of the preceding century. This fact is attested, not only by the accounts
of Windsor market, but by the public fiars of all the different counties of
Scotland,andbytheaccountsofseveraldifferentmarketsinFrance,which
havebeencollectedwithgreatdiligenceandfidelitybyMr.Messanceand
byMr.DuprédeSt.Maur. Theevidenceismorecompletethancouldwell G.ed.p258
have been expected in a matter which is naturally so very difficult to be
ascertained.
588 [6] As to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years, it
canbesufficientlyaccountedforfromthebadnessoftheseasons, without
supposinganydegradationinthevalueofsilver. G.ed.p
The opinion, therefore, that silver is continually sinking in its value,
seemsnottobefoundeduponanygoodobservations,eitherupontheprices
ofcorn,oruponthoseofotherprovisions.
589 [7] Thesamequantityofsilver,itmay,perhaps,besaid,willinthepresent
times,evenaccordingtotheaccountwhichhasbeenheregiven,purchase
a much smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would have
done during some part of the last century; and to ascertain whether this
change be owing to a rise in the value of those goods, or to a fall in the
value of silver, is only to establish a vain and useless distinction, which
can be of no sort of service to the man who has only a certain quantity of
silvertogotomarketwith,oracertainfixedrevenueinmoney. Icertainly
do not pretend that the knowledge of this distinction will enable him to
buycheaper. Itmaynot,however,uponthataccountbealtogetheruseless.
590 [8] It may be of some use to the public by affording an easy proof of the
prosperous condition of the country. If the rise in the price of some sorts
ofprovisionsbeowingaltogethertoafallinthevalueofsilver,itisowing
to a circumstance from which nothing can be inferred but the fertility of
the American mines. The real wealth of the country, the annual produce
of its land and labour, may, notwithstanding this circumstance, be either
192 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
graduallydeclining,asinPortugalandPoland;orgraduallyadvancing,as
in most other parts of Europe. But if this rise in the price of some sorts
of provisions be owing to a rise in the real value of the land which pro-
duces them, to its increased fertility, or, in consequence of more extended
improvementandgoodcultivation,toitshavingbeenrenderedfitforpro-
ducing corn; it is owing to a circumstance which indicates in the clearest
manner the prosperous and advancing state of the country. The land con-
stitutesbyfarthegreatest,themostimportant,andthemostdurablepart
of the wealth of every extensive country. It may surely be of some use, or,
at least, it may give some satisfaction to the public, to have so decisive a
proof of the increasing value of by far the greatest, the most important,
andthemostdurablepartofitswealth.
591 [9] It may, too, be of some use to the public in regulating the pecuniary
reward of some of its inferior servants. If this rise in the price of some
sortsofprovisionsbeowingtoafallinthevalueofsilver, theirpecuniary
reward,provideditwasnottoolargebefore,oughtcertainlytobeaugmen- G.ed.p259
ted in proportion to the extent of this fall. If it is not augmented, their
real recompense will evidently be so much diminished. But if this rise of
price is owing to the increased value, in consequence of the improved fer-
tilityofthelandwhichproducessuchprovisions,itbecomesamuchnicer
matter to judge either in what proportion any pecuniary reward ought to
be augmented, or whether it ought to be augmented at all. The extension
of improvement and cultivation, as it necessarily raises more or less, in
proportion to the price of corn, that of every sort of animal food, so it as
necessarily lowers that of, I believe, every sort of vegetable food. It raises
the price of animal food; because a great part of the land which produces
it, being rendered fit for producing corn, must afford to the landlord and
farmer the rent and profit of corn-land. It lowers the price of vegetable
food;because,byincreasingthefertilityoftheland,itincreasesitsabund-
ance. Theimprovementsofagriculture,too,introducemanysortsofveget-
ablefood,which,requiringlesslandandnotmorelabourthancorn,come
much cheaper to market. Such are potatoes and maize, or what is called
Indiancorn, thetwomostimportantimprovementswhichtheagriculture
ofEurope,perhaps,whichEuropeitselfhasreceivedfromthegreatexten-
sionofitscommerceandnavigation. Manysortsofvegetablefood,besides,
which in the rude state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen-garden,
and raised only by the spade, come in its improved state to be introduced
into common fields, and to be raised by the plough: such as turnips, car-
rots, cabbages, etc. If in the progress of improvement, therefore, the real
priceofonespeciesoffoodnecessarilyrises,thatofanotherasnecessarily
falls, and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far the rise in
the one may be compensated by the fall in the other. When the real price
of butcher’s meat has once got to its height (which, with regard to every
sort, except, perhaps, that of hogs’ flesh, it seems to have done through a
greatpartofEnglandmorethanacenturyago), anyrisewhichcanafter-
193 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

592 [10] In the present season of scarcity the high price of corn no doubt dis-
tresses the poor. But in times of moderate plenty, when corn is at its
ordinary or average price, the natural rise in the price of any other sort
of rude produce cannot much affect them. They suffer more, perhaps, by
the artificial rise which has been occasioned by taxes in the price of some
manufactured commodities; as of salt, soap, leather, candles, malt, beer, G.ed.p260
andale,etc.
Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon
the real Price of Manufactures
G.ed.p
It is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradu-
ally the real price of almost all manufactures. That of the manufacturing
workmanship diminishes, perhaps, in all of them without exception. In
consequenceofbettermachinery,ofgreaterdexterity,andofamoreproper
division and distribution of work, all of which are the natural effects of
improvement,amuchsmallerquantityoflabourbecomesrequisiteforex-
ecuting any particular piece of work, and though, in consequence of the
flourishingcircumstancesofthesociety,therealpriceoflabourshouldrise
very considerably, yet the great diminution of the quantity will generally
much more than compensate the greatest rise which can happen in the
price.
593 [1] There are, indeed, a few manufactures in which the necessary rise in
the real price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the
advantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the
work. In carpenters’ and joiners’ work, and in the coarser sort of cabinet
work,thenecessaryriseintherealpriceofbarrentimber,inconsequence
oftheimprovementofland,willmorethancompensatealltheadvantages
whichcanbederivedfromthebestmachinery, thegreatestdexterity, and
themostproperdivisionanddistributionofwork.
594 [2] But in all cases in which the real price of the rude materials either
does not rise at all, or does not rise very much, that of the manufactured
commoditysinksveryconsiderably.
595 [3] Thisdiminutionofpricehas,inthecourseofthepresentandpreceding
century, been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the ma-
terials are the coarser metals. A better movement of a watch, that about
the middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds,
may now perhaps be had for twenty shillings. In the work of cutiers and
194 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
locksmiths, in all the toys which are made of the coarser metals, and in
all those goods which are commonly known by the name of Birmingham
and Sheffield ware, there has been, during the same period, a very great
reductionofprice,thoughnotaltogethersogreatasinwatch-work. Ithas,
however, been sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part of
Europe,whoinmanycasesacknowledgethattheycanproducenoworkof
equal goodness for double, or even for triple the price. There are perhaps
nomanufacturesinwhichthedivisionoflabourcanbecarriedfurther, or
in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of improve- G.ed.p261
ments,thanthoseofwhichthematerialsarethecoarsermetals.
596 [4] In the clothing manufacture there has, during the same period, been
no such sensible reduction of price. The price of superfine cloth, I have
been assured, on the contrary, has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty
years, risen somewhat in proportion to its quality; owing, it was said, to
a considerable rise in the price of the material, which consists altogether
of Spanish wool. That of the Yorkshire cloth, which is made altogether of
English wool, is said indeed, during the course of the present century, to
have fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality. Quality, however, is
so very disputable a matter that I look upon all information of this kind
as somewhat uncertain. In the clothing manufacture, the division of la-
bour is nearly the same now as it was a century ago, and the machinery
employedisnotverydifferent. Theremay,however,havebeensomesmall
improvementsinboth,whichmayhaveoccasionedsomereductionofprice.
597 [5] But the reduction will appear much more sensible and undeniable if
we compare the price of this manufacture in the present times with what
it was in a much remoter period, towards the end of the fifteenth century,
when the labour was probably much less subdivided, and the machinery
employedmuchmoreimperfect,thanitisatpresent.
598 [6] In 1487, being the 4th of Henry VII, it was enacted that ‘whosoever
shall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained, or of other
grained cloth of the finest making, above sixteen shillings, shall forfeit
forty shillings for every yard so sold.’ Sixteen shillings, therefore, con-
taining about the same quantity of silver as four-and-twenty shillings of
ourpresentmoney, was, atthattime, reckonednotanunreasonableprice
for a yard of the finest cloth; and as this is a sumptuary law, such cloth,
it is probable, had usually been sold somewhat dearer. A guinea may be
reckoned the highest price in the present times. Even though the quality
of the cloths, therefore, should be supposed equal, and that of the present
timesismostprobablymuchsuperior,yet,evenuponthissupposition,the
moneypriceofthefinestclothappearstohavebeenconsiderablyreduced
since the end of the fifteenth century. But its real price has been much
morereduced. Sixshillingsandeightpencewasthen,andlongafterwards,
reckonedtheaveragepriceofaquarterofwheat. Sixteenshillings,there-
fore, was the price of two quarters and more than three bushels of wheat. G.ed.p262
Valuing a quarter of wheat in the present times at eight-and-twenty shil-
195 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
lings, the real price of a yard of fine cloth must, in those times, have been
equal to at least three pounds six shillings and sixpence of our present
money. The man who bought it must have parted with the command of a
quantityoflabourandsubsistenceequaltowhatthatsumwouldpurchase
inthepresenttimes.
599 [7] The reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture, though con-
siderable,hasnotbeensogreatasinthatofthefine.
600 [8] In1643,beingthe3rdofEdwardIV,itwasenactedthat‘noservantin
husbandry, nor common labourer, nor servant to any artificer inhabiting
out of a city or burgh shall use or wear in their clothing any cloth above
two shillings the broad yard.’ In the 3rd of Edward IV, two shillings con-
tainedverynearlythesamequantityofsilverasfourofourpresentmoney.
ButtheYorkshireclothwhichisnowsoldatfourshillingstheyardisprob-
ablymuchsuperiortoanythatwasthenmadeforthewearingofthevery
poorestorderofcommonservants. Eventhemoneypriceoftheirclothing,
therefore, may, in proportion to the quality, be somewhat cheaper in the
present than it was in those ancient times. The real price is certainly a
good deal cheaper. Tenpence was then reckoned what is called the mod-
erate and reasonable price of a bushel of wheat. Two shillings, therefore,
was the price of two bushels and near two pecks of wheat, which in the
present times, at three shillings and sixpence the bushel, would be worth
eight shillings and ninepence. For a yard of this cloth the poor servant
must have parted with the power of purchasing a quantity of subsistence
equaltowhateightshillingsandninepencewouldpurchaseinthepresent
times. This is a sumptuary law too, restraining the luxury and extravag-
anceofthepoor. Theirclothing,therefore,hadcommonlybeenmuchmore
expensive.
601 [9] Thesameorderofpeopleare,bythesamelaw,prohibitedfromwearing
hose, of which the price should exceed fourteenpence the pair, equal to
abouteight-and-twentypenceofourpresentmoney. Butfourteenpencewas
in those times the price of a bushel and near two pecks of wheat, which,
in the present times, at three and sixpence the bushel, would cost five
shillings and threepence. We should in the present times consider this as
a very high price for a pair of stockings, to a servant of the poorest and
lowestorder. Hemust,however,inthosetimeshavepaidwhatwasreally
equivalenttothispriceforthem.
602 [10] In the time of Edward IV the art of knitting stockings was probably
notknowninanypartofEurope. Theirhoseweremadeofcommoncloth,
whichmayhavebeenoneofthecausesoftheirdearness. Thefirstperson

receivedthemasapresentfromtheSpanishambassador.
603 [11] Bothinthecoarseandinthefinewoollenmanufacture,themachinery G.ed.p263
employed was much more imperfect in those ancient than it is in the
present times. It has since received three very capital improvements, be-
sides,probably,manysmalleronesofwhichitmaybedifficulttoascertain
196 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
either the number or the importance. The three capital improvements
are: first, the exchange of the rock and spindle for the spinning-wheel,
which, with the same quantity of labour, will perform more than double
thequantityofwork. Secondly,theuseofseveralveryingeniousmachines
which facilitate and abridge in a still greater proportion the winding of
theworstedandwoollenyarn,ortheproperarrangementofthewarpand
woof before they are put into the loom; an operation which, previous to
the invention of those machines, must have been extremely tedious and
troublesome. Thirdly, the employment of the fulling mill for thickening
the cloth, instead of treading it in water. Neither wind nor water mills of
anykindwereknowninEnglandsoearlyasthebeginningofthesixteenth
century,nor,sofarasIknow,inanyotherpartofEuropenorthoftheAlps.
TheyhadbeenintroducedintoItalysometimebefore.
604 [12] Theconsiderationofthesecircumstancesmay,perhaps,insomemeas-
ure explain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine
manufacturewassomuchhigherinthoseancientthanitisinthepresent
times. It cost a greater quantity of labour to bring the goods to market.
When they were brought thither, therefore, they must have purchased or
exchangedforthepriceofagreaterquantity.
605 [13] The coarse manufacture probably was, in those ancient times, carried
on in England, in the same manner as it always has been in countries
whereartsandmanufacturesareintheirinfancy. Itwasprobablyahouse-
holdmanufacture,inwhicheverydifferentpartoftheworkwasoccasion-
allyperformedbyallthedifferentmembersofalmosteveryprivatefamily;
but so as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do, and not
to be the principal business from which any of them derived the greater
part of their subsistence. The work which is performed in this manner, it
has already been observed, comes always much cheaper to market than
thatwhichistheprincipalorsolefundoftheworkman’ssubsistence. The
fine manufacture, on the other hand, was not in those times carried on in
England, but in the rich and commercial country of Flanders; and it was
probably conducted then, in the same manner as now, by people who de-
rived the whole, or the principal part of their subsistence from it. It was,
besides,aforeignmanufacture,andmusthavepaidsomeduty,theancient
custom of tonnage and poundage at least, to the king. This duty, indeed,
would not probably be very great. It was not then the policy of Europe G.ed.p264
to restrain, by high duties, the importation of foreign manufactures, but
rather to encourage it, in order that merchants might be enabled to sup-
ply,ataseasyarateaspossible,thegreatmenwiththeconveniencesand
luxuries which they wanted, and which the industry of their own country
couldnotaffordthem.
606 [14] The consideration of these circumstances may perhaps in some meas-
ure explain to us why, in those ancient times, the real price of the coarse
manufacture was, in proportion to that of the fine, so much lower than in
thepresenttimes.
197 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
CONCLUSION of the CHAPTER
G.ed.p
I shall conclude this very long chapter with observing that every im-
provement in the circumstances of the society tends either directly or in-
directly to raise the real rent of land, to increase the real wealth of the
landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the produce of the labour
ofotherpeople.
607 [1] Theextensionofimprovementandcultivationtendstoraiseitdirectly.
Thelandlord’sshareoftheproducenecessarilyincreaseswiththeincrease
oftheproduce.
608 [2] That rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land,
which is first the effect of extended improvement and cultivation, and af-
terwards the cause of their being still further extended, the rise in the
priceofcattle,forexample,tendstootoraisetherentoflanddirectly,and
in a still greater proportion. The real value of the landlord’s share, his
real command of the labour of other people, not only rises with the real
value of the produce, but the proportion of his share to the whole produce
riseswithit. Thatproduce,aftertheriseinitsrealprice,requiresnomore
labour to collect it than before. A smaller proportion of it will, therefore,
be sufficient to replace, with the ordinary profit, the stock which employs
that labour. A greater proportion of it must, consequently, belong to the
landlord.
609 [3] Allthoseimprovementsintheproductivepowersoflabour,whichtend
directly to reduce the real price of manufactures, tend indirectly to raise
therealrentofland. Thelandlordexchangesthatpartofhisrudeproduce,
whichisoverandabovehisownconsumption, orwhatcomestothesame
thing, the price of that part of it, for manufactured produce. Whatever
reduces the real price of the latter, raises that of the former. An equal
quantityoftheformerbecomestherebyequivalenttoagreaterquantityof G.ed.p265
the latter; and the landlord is enabled to purchase a greater quantity of
theconveniences,ornaments,orluxuries,whichhehasoccasionfor.
610 [4] Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the
quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the
real rent of land. A certain proportion of this labour naturally goes to the
land. Agreaternumberofmenandcattleareemployedinitscultivation,
theproduceincreaseswiththeincreaseofthestockwhichisthusemployed
inraisingit,andtherentincreaseswiththeproduce.
611 [5] The contrary circumstances, the neglect of cultivation and improve-
ment, the fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land,
theriseintherealpriceofmanufacturesfromthedecayofmanufacturing
art and industry, the declension of the real wealth of the society, all tend,
ontheotherhand,tolowertherealrentofland,toreducetherealwealth
198 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of the landlord, to diminish his power of purchasing either the labour, or
theproduceofthelabourofotherpeople.
612 [6] The whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or
what comes to the same thing, the whole price of that annual produce,
naturallydividesitself,ithasalreadybeenobserved,intothreeparts;the
rent of land, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and constitutes
a revenue to three different orders of people; to those who live by rent, to
those who live by wages, and to those who live by profit. These are the
threegreat,original,andconstituentordersofeverycivilisedsociety,from
whoserevenuethatofeveryotherorderisultimatelyderived.
613 [7] The interest of the first of those three great orders, it appears from
what has been just now said, is strictly and inseparably connected with
the general interest of the society. Whatever either promotes or obstructs
the one, necessarily promotes or obstructs the other. When the public de-
liberatesconcerninganyregulationofcommerceorpolice,theproprietors
of land never can mislead it, with a view to promote the interest of their
ownparticularorder;atleast,iftheyhaveanytolerableknowledgeofthat
interest. Theyare,indeed,toooftendefectiveinthistolerableknowledge.
Theyaretheonlyoneofthethreeorderswhoserevenuecoststhemneither
labournorcare,butcomestothem,asitwere,ofitsownaccord,andinde-
pendent of any plan or project of their own. That indolence, which is the
naturaleffectoftheeaseandsecurityoftheirsituation,rendersthemtoo
often, not only ignorant, but incapable of that application of mind which
is necessary in order to foresee and understand the consequences of any
publicregulation.
614 [8] The interest of the second order, that of those who live by wages, is as G.ed.p266
strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first. The
wagesofthelabourer,ithasalreadybeenshown,areneversohighaswhen
thedemandforlabouriscontinuallyrising,orwhenthequantityemployed
iseveryyearincreasingconsiderably. Whenthisrealwealthofthesociety
becomesstationary,hiswagesaresoonreducedtowhatisbarelyenoughto
enablehimtobringupafamily,ortocontinuetheraceoflabourers. When
thesocietydeclines,theyfallevenbelowthis. Theorderofproprietorsmay,
perhaps,gainmorebytheprosperityofthesocietythanthatoflabourers:
but there is no order that suffers so cruelly from its decline. But though
theinterestofthelabourerisstrictlyconnectedwiththatofthesociety,he
isincapableeitherofcomprehendingthatinterestorofunderstandingits
connection with his own. His condition leaves him no time to receive the
necessary information, and his education and habits are commonly such
as to render him unfit to judge even though he was fully informed. In the
public deliberations, therefore, his voice is little heard and less regarded,
exceptuponsomeparticularoccasions,whenhisclamourisanimated,set
on and supported by his employers, not for his, but their own particular
purposes.
615 [9] His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by
199 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
profit. Itisthestockthatisemployedforthesakeofprofitwhichputsinto
motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society. The plans
andprojectsoftheemployersofstockregulateanddirectallthemostim-
portant operations of labour, and profit is the end proposed by all those
plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages,
risewiththeprosperityandfallwiththedeclensionofthesociety. Onthe
contrary,itisnaturallylowinrichandhighinpoorcountries,anditisal-
wayshighestinthecountrieswhicharegoingfastesttoruin. Theinterest
of this third order, therefore, has not the same connection with the gen-
eralinterestofthesocietyasthatoftheothertwo. Merchantsandmaster
manufacturers are, in this order, the two classes of people who commonly
employ the largest capitals, and who by their wealth draw to themselves
thegreatestshareofthepublicconsideration. Asduringtheirwholelives
they are engaged in plans and projects, they have frequently more acute-
ness of understanding than the greater part of country gentlemen. As
theirthoughts,however,arecommonlyexercisedratherabouttheinterest
of their own particular branch of business, than about that of the society,
their judgment, even when given with the greatest candour (which it has
notbeenuponeveryoccasion)ismuchmoretobedependeduponwithre-
gardtotheformerofthosetwoobjectsthanwithregardtothelatter. Their
superiorityoverthecountrygentlemanisnotsomuchintheirknowledge G.ed.p267
of the public interest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own
interest than he has of his. It is by this superior knowledge of their own
interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and per-
suadedhimtogiveupbothhisowninterestandthatofthepublic,froma
verysimplebuthonestconvictionthattheirinterest,andnothis,wasthe
interest of the public. The interest of the dealers, however, in any partic-
ularbranchoftradeormanufactures,isalwaysinsomerespectsdifferent

market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public;
but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve
only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they natur-
ally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest
oftheirfellow-citizens. Theproposalofanynewlaworregulationofcom-
merce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with
greatprecaution,andoughtnevertobeadoptedtillafterhavingbeenlong
and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the

Of the Nature, Accumulation, and
Employment of Stock INTRODUCTION
616 [1] INthatrudestateofsocietyinwhichthereisnodivisionoflabour,inwhich
exchangesareseldommade, andinwhicheverymanprovideseverything
for himself, it is not necessary that any stock should be accumulated or
storedupbeforehandinordertocarryonthebusinessofthesociety. Every
man endeavours to supply by his own industry his own occasional wants
as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the forest to hunt; when his
coatiswornout, heclotheshimselfwiththeskinofthefirstlargeanimal
hekills: andwhenhishutbeginstogotoruin,herepairsit,aswellashe
can,withthetreesandtheturfthatarenearestit.
617 [2] But when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced,
the produce of a man’s own labour can supply but a very small part of
his occasional wants. The far greater part of them are supplied by the
produce of other men’s labour, which he purchases with the produce, or,
what is the same thing, with the price of the produce of his own. But this
purchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labour
has not only been completed, but sold. A stock of goods of different kinds,
therefore, must be stored up somewhere sufficient to maintain him, and
to supply him with the materials and tools of his work till such time, at
least, as both these events can be brought about. A weaver cannot apply
himselfentirelytohispeculiarbusiness,unlessthereisbeforehandstored G.ed.p277
upsomewhere,eitherinhisownpossessionorinthatofsomeotherperson,
a stock sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with the materials
andtoolsofhiswork,tillhehasnotonlycompleted,butsoldhisweb. This
accumulationmust,evidently,beprevioustohisapplyinghisindustryfor
solongatimetosuchapeculiarbusiness.
618 [3] Astheaccumulationofstockmust,inthenatureofthings,beprevious
tothedivisionoflabour,solabourcanbemoreandmoresubdividedinpro-
portiononlyasstockispreviouslymoreandmoreaccumulated. Thequant-
ityofmaterialswhichthesamenumberofpeoplecanworkup,increasesin
agreatproportionaslabourcomestobemoreandmoresubdivided;andas
theoperationsofeachworkmanaregraduallyreducedtoagreaterdegree
of simplicity, a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitat-
ing and abridging those operations. As the division of labour advances,
therefore, in order to give constant employment to an equal number of
workmen, an equal stock of provisions, and a greater stock of materials
andtoolsthanwhatwouldhavebeennecessaryinaruderstateofthings,
must be accumulated beforehand. But the number of workmen in every
branch of business generally increases with the division of labour in that TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
branch,orratheritistheincreaseoftheirnumberwhichenablesthemto
classandsubdividethemselvesinthismanner.
619 [4] As the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on
this great improvement in the productive powers of labour, so that accu-
mulation naturally leads to this improvement. The person who employs
his stock in maintaining labour, necessarily wishes to employ it in such
a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible. He en-
deavours, therefore, both to make among his workmen the most proper
distribution of employment, and to furnish them with the best machines
which he can either invent or afford to purchase. His abilities in both
these respects are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock, or to
thenumberofpeoplewhomitcanemploy. Thequantityofindustry,there-
fore, not only increases in every country with the increase of the stock
which employs it, but, in consequence of that increase, the same quantity
ofindustryproducesamuchgreaterquantityofwork.
620 [5] Such are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry
anditsproductivepowers.
621 [6] InthefollowingbookIhaveendeavouredtoexplainthenatureofstock,
the effects of its accumulation into capitals of different kinds, and the
effects of the different employments of those capitals. This book is di-
vided into five chapters. In the first chapter, I have endeavoured to show
whatarethedifferentpartsorbranchesintowhichthestock,eitherofan
individual, or of a great society, naturally divides itself. In the second, I G.ed.p278
haveendeavouredtoexplainthenatureandoperationofmoneyconsidered
asaparticularbranchofthegeneralstockofthesociety. Thestockwhich
is accumulated into a capital, may either be employed by the person to
whom it belongs, or it may be lent to some other person. In the third and
fourth chapters, I have endeavoured to examine the manner in which it
operates in both these situations. The fifth and last chapter treats of the
different effects which the different employments of capital immediately
produce upon the quantity both of national industry, and of the annual
produceoflandandlabour.
213 CHAPTER I
G.ed.p279
OF THE DIVISION OF STOCK
622 [1] WHENthestockwhichamanpossessesisnomorethansufficienttomain-
tain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any
revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and endeavours
by his labour to acquire something which may supply its place before it
be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived from his la-
bour only. This is the state of the greater part of the labouring poor in all
countries.
623 [2] But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or
years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part
ofit;reservingonlysomuchforhisimmediateconsumptionasmaymain-
tain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock, therefore,
is distinguished into two parts. That part which, he expects, is to afford
himthisrevenue,iscalledhiscapital. Theotheristhatwhichsupplieshis
immediateconsumption;andwhichconsistseither,first,inthatportionof
hiswholestockwhichwasoriginallyreservedforthispurpose;or,secondly,
inhisrevenue,fromwhateversourcederived,asitgraduallycomesin;or,
thirdly, in such things as had been purchased by either of these in former
years,andwhicharenotyetentirelyconsumed;suchasastockofclothes,
household furniture, and the like. In one, or other, or all of these three
articles,consiststhestockwhichmencommonlyreservefortheirownim-
mediateconsumption.
624 [3] Therearetwodifferentwaysinwhichacapitalmaybeemployedsoas
toyieldarevenueorprofittoitsemployer.
625 [4] First, it may be employed in raising, manufacturing, or purchasing
goods, and selling them again with a profit. The capital employed in this
manneryieldsnorevenueorprofittoitsemployer,whileiteitherremains
in his possession, or continues in the same shape. The goods of the mer-
chant yield him no revenue or profit till he sells them for money, and the
moneyyieldshimaslittletillitisagainexchangedforgoods. Hiscapitalis
continuallygoingfromhiminoneshape,andreturningtohiminanother,
and it is only by means of such circulation, or successive exchanges, that
itcanyieldhimanyprofit. Suchcapitals, therefore, mayveryproperlybe
calledcirculatingcapitals.
626 [5] Secondly, it may be employed in the improvement of land, in the pur- TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
chase of useful machines and instruments of trade, or in suchlike things
as yield a revenue or profit without changing masters, or circulating any
further. Such capitals, therefore, may very properly be called fixed capit-
als.
627 [6] Different occupations require very different proportions between the G.ed.p280
fixedandcirculatingcapitalsemployedinthem.
628 [7] Thecapitalofamerchant,forexample,isaltogetheracirculatingcap-
ital. He has occasion for no machines or instruments of trade, unless his
shop,orwarehouse,beconsideredassuch.
629 [8] Somepartofthecapitalofeverymasterartificerormanufacturermust
be fixed in the instruments of his trade. This part, however, is very small
insome,andverygreatinothers. Amastertailorrequiresnootherinstru-
mentsoftradebutaparcelofneedles. Thoseofthemastershoemakerare
alittle,thoughbutaverylittle,moreexpensive. Thoseoftheweaverrisea
gooddealabovethoseoftheshoemaker. Thefargreaterpartofthecapital
of all such master artificers, however, is circulated, either in the wages of
their workmen, or in the price of their materials, and repaid with a profit
bythepriceofthework.
630 [9] Inotherworksamuchgreaterfixedcapitalisrequired. Inagreatiron-
work,forexample,thefurnaceformeltingtheore,theforge,theslitt-mill,
are instruments of trade which cannot be erected without a very great
expense. Incoal-worksandminesofeverykind, themachinerynecessary
both for drawing out the water and for other purposes is frequently still
moreexpensive.
631 [10] That part of the capital of the farmer which is employed in the instru-
ments of agriculture is a fixed, that which is employed in the wages and
maintenance of his labouring servants, is a circulating capital. He makes
aprofitoftheonebykeepingitinhisownpossession,andoftheotherby
parting with it. The price or value of his labouring cattle is a fixed cap-
ital in the same manner as that of the instruments of husbandry. Their
maintenance is a circulating capital in the same manner as that of the
labouring servants. The farmer makes his profit by keeping the labour-
ingcattle, andby parting withtheirmaintenance. Both thepriceandthe
maintenance of the cattle which are brought in and fattened, not for la-
bour,butforsale,areacirculatingcapital. Thefarmermakeshisprofitby
parting with them. A flock of sheep or a herd of cattle that, in a breeding
country,isboughtin,neitherforlabour,norforsale,butinordertomakea
profitbytheirwool,bytheirmilk,andbytheirincrease,isafixedcapital.
The profit is made by keeping them. Their maintenance is a circulating
capital. Theprofitismadebypartingwithit;anditcomesbackwithboth
itsownprofitandtheprofituponthewholepriceofthecattle,intheprice
ofthewool,themilk,andtheincrease. Thewholevalueoftheseed,too,is G.ed.p281
properly a fixed capital. Though it goes backwards and forwards between
thegroundandthegranary, itneverchangesmasters, andthereforedoes
215 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
notproperlycirculate. Thefarmermakeshisprofit,notbyitssale,butby
itsincrease.
632 [11] Thegeneralstockofanycountryorsocietyisthesamewiththatofall
itsinhabitantsormembers,andthereforenaturallydividesitselfintothe
samethreeportions,eachofwhichhasadistinctfunctionoroffice.
633 [12] The first is that portion which is reserved for immediate consumption,
and of which the characteristic is, that it affords no revenue or profit. It
consistsinthestockoffood,clothes,householdfurniture,etc.,whichhave
beenpurchasedbytheirproperconsumers, butwhicharenotyetentirely
consumed. Thewholestockofmeredwelling-housestoo,subsistingatany
onetimeinthecountry,makeapartofthisfirstportion. Thestockthatis
laidoutinahouse,ifitistobethedwellinghouseoftheproprietor,ceases
from that moment to serve in the function of a capital, or to afford any
revenuetoitsowner. Adwellinghouse,assuch,contributesnothingtothe
revenue of its inhabitant; and though it is, no doubt, extremely useful to
him, itisashisclothesandhouseholdfurnitureareusefultohim, which,
however,makesapartofhisexpense,andnotofhisrevenue. Ifitistobe
let to a tenant for rent, as the house itself can produce nothing, the ten-
ant must always pay the rent out of some other revenue which he derives
eitherfromlabour,orstock,orland. Thoughahouse,therefore,mayyield
a revenue to its proprietor, and thereby serve in the function of a capital
to him, it cannot yield any to the public, nor serve in the function of a
capitaltoit,andtherevenueofthewholebodyofthepeoplecanneverbe
in the smallest degree increased by it. Clothes, and household furniture,
in the same manner, sometimes yield a revenue, and thereby serve in the
function of a capital to particular persons. In countries where masquer-
ades are common, it is a trade to let out masquerade dresses for a night.
Upholsterers frequently let furniture by the month or by the year. Un-
dertakers let the furniture of funerals by the day and by the week. Many
people let furnished houses, and get a rent, not only for the use of the
house, but for that of the furniture. The revenue, however, which is de-
rivedfromsuchthingsmustalwaysbeultimatelydrawnfromsomeother
sourceofrevenue. Ofallpartsofthestock, eitherofanindividual, orofa
society,reservedforimmediateconsumption,whatislaidoutinhousesis
most slowly consumed. A stock of clothes may last several years: a stock
of furniture half a century or a century: but a stock of houses, well built
andproperlytakencareof,maylastmanycenturies. Thoughtheperiodof

stock reserved for immediate consumption as either clothes or household
furniture.
634 [13] The second of the three portions into which the general stock of the
society divides itself, is the fixed capital, of which the characteristic is,
thatitaffordsarevenueorprofitwithoutcirculatingorchangingmasters.
Itconsistschieflyofthefourfollowingarticles:
216 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
635 [14] First, of all useful machines and instruments of trade which facilitate
andabridgelabour:
636 [15] Secondly, of all those profitable buildings which are the means of pro-
curing a revenue, not only to their proprietor who lets them for a rent,
but to the person who possesses them and pays that rent for them; such
as shops, warehouses, workhouses, farmhouses, with all their necessary
buildings; stables, granaries, etc. These are very different from mere
dwellinghouses. Theyareasortofinstrumentsoftrade,andmaybecon-
sideredinthesamelight:
637 [16] Thirdly, of the improvements of land, of what has been profitably laid
out in clearing, draining, enclosing, manuring, and reducing it into the
conditionmostproperfortillageandculture. Animprovedfarmmayvery
justlyberegardedinthesamelightasthoseusefulmachineswhichfacilit-
ateandabridgelabour,andbymeansofwhichanequalcirculatingcapital
can afford a much greater revenue to its employer. An improved farm is
equally advantageous and more durable than any of those machines, fre-
quently requiring no other repairs than the most profitable application of
thefarmer’scapitalemployedincultivatingit:
638 [17] Fourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or
members of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the mainten-
anceoftheacquirerduringhiseducation,study,orapprenticeship,always

639 [18] Thethirdandlastofthethreeportionsintowhichthegeneralstockof
the society naturally divides itself, is the circulating capital; of which the
characteristic is, that it affords a revenue only by circulating or changing
masters. Itiscomposedlikewiseoffourparts:

643 [22] Fourthly, and lastly, of the work which is made up and completed, but
which is still in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer, and not yet
disposed of or distributed to the proper consumers; such as the finished
work which we frequently find ready-made in the shops of the smith, the
217 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
cabinet-maker, the goldsmith, the jeweller, the china-merchant, etc. The
circulating capital consists in this manner, of the provisions, materials,
and finished work of all kinds that are in the hands of their respective
dealers,andofthemoneythatisnecessaryforcirculatinganddistributing
themtothosewhoarefinallytouseortoconsumethem.
644 [23] Of these four parts, three, provisions, materials, and finished work,
are,eitherannually,orinalongerorshorterperiod,regularlywithdrawn
from it, and placed either in the fixed capital or in the stock reserved for
immediateconsumption.
645 [24] Every fixed capital is both originally derived from, and requires to be
continuallysupportedbyacirculatingcapital. Allusefulmachinesandin-
strumentsoftradeareoriginallyderivedfromacirculatingcapital,which
furnishes the materials of which they are made, and the maintenance of
theworkmenwhomakethem. Theyrequire,too,acapitalofthesamekind
tokeeptheminconstantrepair.
646 [25] No fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating
capital. The most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce
nothing without the circulating capital which affords the materials they
are employed upon, and the maintenance of the workmen who employ
them. Land, however improved, will yield no revenue without a circu-
latingcapital,whichmaintainsthelabourerswhocultivateandcollectits
produce.

diateconsumptionisthesoleendandpurposebothofthefixedandcircu-
latingcapitals. Itisthisstockwhichfeeds,clothes,andlodgesthepeople.
Their riches or poverty depends upon the abundant or sparing supplies
which those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate
consumption.
648 [27] So great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn G.ed.p284
fromit,inordertobeplacedintheothertwobranchesofthegeneralstock
ofthesociety;itmustinitsturnrequirecontinualsupplies,withoutwhich
it would soon cease to exist. These supplies are principally drawn from
threesources,theproduceofland,ofmines,andoffisheries. Theseafford
continualsuppliesofprovisionsandmaterials,ofwhichpartisafterwards
wrought up into finished work, and by which are replaced the provisions,
materials, and finished work continually withdrawn from the circulating
capital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for maintaining and
augmenting that part of it which consists in money. For though, in the
ordinary course of business, this part is not, like the other three, neces-
sarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches
of the general stock of the society, it must, however, like all other things,
be wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too, be either lost or sent
abroad, and must, therefore, require continual, though, no doubt, much
smallersupplies.
649 [28] Land, mines, and fisheries, require all both a fixed and a circulating

capitaltocultivatethem;andtheirproducereplaceswithaprofit,notonly
those capitals, but all the others in the society. Thus the farmer annu-
ally replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had consumed
andthematerialswhichbehadwroughtuptheyearbefore;andtheman-
ufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had wasted
andwornoutinthesametime. Thisistherealexchangethatisannually
made between those two orders of people, though it seldom happens that
the rude produce of the one and the manufactured produce of the other,
are directly bartered for one another; because it seldom happens that the
farmersellshiscornandhiscattle,hisflaxandhiswool,totheverysame
person of whom he chooses to purchase the clothes, furniture, and instru-
ments of trade which he wants. He sells, therefore, his rude produce for
money,withwhichhecanpurchase,whereveritistobehad,themanufac-
turedproducehehasoccasionfor. Landevenreplaces,inpartatleast,the
capitals with which fisheries and mines are cultivated. It is the produce
of land which draws the fish from the waters; and it is the produce of the
surfaceoftheearthwhichextractsthemineralsfromitsbowels.
650 [29] The produce of land, mines, and fisheries, when their natural fertility
is equal, is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the cap-
itals employed about them. When the capitals are equal and equally well
applied,itisinproportiontotheirnaturalfertility.
651 [30] Inallcountrieswherethereistolerablesecurity,everymanofcommon
understandingwill endeavour toemploy whateverstock he cancommand G.ed.p285
in procuring either present enjoyment or future profit. If it is employed
in procuring present enjoyment, it is a stock reserved for immediate con-
sumption. Ifitisemployedinprocuringfutureprofit,itmustprocurethis

652 [31] In those unfortunate countries, indeed, where men are continually
afraid of the violence of their superiors, they frequently bury and conceal
a great part of their stock, in order to have it always at hand to carry
with them to some place of safety, in case of their being threatened with
any of those disasters to which they consider themselves as at all times
exposed. This is said to be a common practice in Turkey, in Indostan,
and, I believe, in most other governments of Asia. It seems to have been
a common practice among our ancestors during the violence of the feudal
government. Treasure-trovewasinthosetimesconsideredasnocontempt-
ible part of the revenue of the greatest sovereigns in Europe. It consisted

220 CHAPTER II
G.ed.p286
OF MONEY CONSIDERED AS A
PARTICULAR BRANCH OF THE GENERAL
STOCK OF THE SOCIETY, OR OF THE
EXPENSE OF MAINTAINING THE
NATIONAL CAPITAL
653 [1] IT has been shown in the first book, that the price of the greater part of
commodities resolves itself into three parts, of which one pays the wages
of the labour, another the profits of the stock, and a third the rent of the
landwhichhadbeenemployedinproducingandbringingthemtomarket:
thatthereare,indeed,somecommoditiesofwhichthepriceismadeupof
two of those parts only, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock: and
a very few in which it consists altogether in one, the wages of labour: but
thatthepriceofeverycommoditynecessarilyresolvesitselfintosomeone,
or other, or all of these three parts; every part of it which goes neither to
rentnortowages,beingnecessarilyprofittosomebody.
654 [2] Since this is the case, it has been observed, with regard to every par-
ticular commodity, taken separately, it must be so with regard to all the
commoditieswhichcomposethewholeannualproduceofthelandandla-
bour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or exchangeable
valueofthatannualproducemustresolveitselfintothesamethreeparts,
andbeparcelledoutamongthedifferentinhabitantsofthecountry,either
as the wages of their labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their
land.
655 [3] But though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and la-
bour of every country is thus divided among and constitutes a revenue to
its different inhabitants, yet as in the rent of a private estate we distin-
guish between the gross rent and the net rent, so may we likewise in the
revenueofalltheinhabitantsofagreatcountry.
656 [4] Thegrossrentofaprivateestatecomprehendswhateverispaidbythe
farmer; the net rent, what remains free to the landlord, after deducting
the expense of management, of repairs, and all other necessary charges;
or what, without hurting his estate, he can afford to place in his stock re-
served for immediate consumption, or to spend upon his table, equipage, TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the ornaments of his house and furniture, his private enjoyments and
amusements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his gross, but to
hisnetrent.
657 [5] The gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country compre-
hendsthewholeannualproduceoftheirlandandlabour;thenetrevenue,
what remains free to them after deducting the expense of maintaining;
first, their fixed, and, secondly, their circulating capital; or what, without
encroaching upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for
immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniencies, G.ed.p287
and amusements. Their real wealth, too, is in proportion, not to their
gross,buttotheirnetrevenue.
658 [6] The whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must evidently be
excludedfromthenetrevenueofthesociety. Neitherthematerialsneces-
sary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade, their
profitablebuildings,etc.,northeproduceofthelabournecessaryforfash-
ioning those materials into the proper form, can ever make any part of it.
The price of that labour may indeed make a part of it; as the workmen so
employedmayplacethewholevalueoftheirwagesintheirstockreserved
forimmediateconsumption. Butinothersortsoflabour,boththepriceand
theproducegotothisstock,thepricetothatoftheworkmen,theproduce
tothatofotherpeople,whosesubsistence,conveniences,andamusements,
areaugmentedbythelabourofthoseworkmen.
659 [7] The intention of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers
of labour, or to enable the same number of labourers to perform a much
greater quantity of work. In a farm where all the necessary buildings,
fences,drains,communications,etc.,areinthemostperfectgoodorder,the
same number of labourers and labouring cattle will raise a much greater
produce than in one of equal extent and equally good ground, but not fur-
nished with equal conveniencies. In manufactures the same number of
hands, assisted with the best machinery, will work up a much greater
quantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of trade. The
expense which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind, is al-
waysrepaidwithgreatprofit,andincreasestheannualproducebyamuch
greater value than that of the support which such improvements require.
This support, however, still requires a certain portion of that produce. A
certainquantityofmaterials,andthelabourofacertainnumberofwork-
men,bothofwhichmighthavebeenimmediatelyemployedtoaugmentthe
food,clothingandlodging,thesubsistenceandconvenienciesofthesociety,
arethusdivertedtoanotheremployment,highlyadvantageousindeed,but
stilldifferentfromthisone. Itisuponthisaccountthatallsuchimprove-
ments in mechanics, as enable the same number of workmen to perform
anequalquantityofwork, withcheaperandsimplermachinerythanhad
beenusualbefore,arealwaysregardedasadvantageoustoeverysociety. A
certainquantityofmaterials,andthelabourofacertainnumberofwork-
men, which had before been employed in supporting a more complex and
222 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
expensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to augment the quantity
of work which that or any other machinery is useful only for performing.

workmen. The quantityofthatwork, therefore, whichhismachinerywas
usefulonlyforperforming,willnaturallybeaugmented,andwithitallthe
advantageandconveniencywhichthesocietycanderivefromthatwork.
660 [8] The expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country may
very properly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate. The ex-
penseofrepairsmayfrequentlybenecessaryforsupportingtheproduceof
the estate, and consequently both the gross and the net rent of the land-
lord. When by a more proper direction, however, it can be diminished
without occasioning any diminution of produce, the gross rent remains at
leastthesameasbefore,andthenetrentisnecessarilyaugmented.
661 [9] But though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is thus
necessarilyexcludedfromthenetrevenueofthesociety,itisnotthesame
case with that of maintaining the circulating capital. Of the four parts
ofwhichthislattercapitaliscomposed,money,provisions,materials,and
finished work, the three last, it has already been observed, are regularly
withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital of the society, or
in their stock reserved for immediate consumption. Whatever portion of
thoseconsumablegoodsisemployedinmaintainingtheformer,goesallto
thelatter,andmakesapartofthenetrevenueofthesociety. Themainten-
anceofthosethreepartsofthecirculatingcapital,therefore,withdrawsno
portion of the annual produce from the net revenue of the society, besides
whatisnecessaryformaintainingthefixedcapital.
662 [10] Thecirculatingcapitalofasocietyisinthisrespectdifferentfromthat
ofanindividual. Thatofanindividualistotallyexcludedfrommakingany
part of his net revenue, which must consist altogether in his profits. But
though the circulating capital of every individual makes a part of that of
thesocietytowhichhebelongs,itisnotuponthataccounttotallyexcluded

forimmediateconsumption,theymayinthatofotherpeople,who,froma
revenue derived from other funds, may regularly replace their value to
him, together with its profits, without occasioning any diminution either
ofhiscapitaloroftheirs.
663 [11] Money, therefore, is the only part of the circulating capital of a soci-
ety, of which the maintenance can occasion any diminution in their net
revenue.
664 [12] Thefixedcapital,andthatpartofthecirculatingcapitalwhichconsists
inmoney,sofarastheyaffecttherevenueofthesociety,bearaverygreat
resemblancetooneanother.
223 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
665 [13] First, as those machines and instruments of trade, etc., require a cer-
tain expense, first to erect them, and afterwards to support them, both
whichexpenses,thoughtheymakeapartofthegross,aredeductionsfrom G.ed.p289
the net revenue of the society; so the stock of money which circulates in
any country must require a certain expense, first to collect it, and after-
wards to support it, both which expenses, though they make a part of the
gross, are, in the same manner, deductions from the net revenue of the
society. Acertainquantityofveryvaluablematerials,goldandsilver,and
of very curious labour, instead of augmenting the stock reserved for im-
mediateconsumption, thesubsistence, conveniencies, andamusementsof
individuals, is employed in supporting that great but expensive instru-
ment of commerce, by means of which every individual in the society has
his subsistence, conveniencies, and amusements regularly distributed to
himintheirproperproportions.
666 [14] Secondly,asthemachinesandinstrumentsofatrade,etc.,whichcom-
pose the fixed capital either of an individual or of a society, make no part
either of the gross or of the net revenue of either; so money, by means
of which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among
all its different members, makes itself no part of that revenue. The great
wheel of circulation is altogether different from the goods which are cir-
culated by means of it. The revenue of the society consists altogether in
those goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them. In computing
either the gross or the net revenue of any society, we must always, from
theirwholeannualcirculationofmoneyandgoods,deductthewholevalue
of the money, of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of
either.
667 [15] It is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition
appear either doubtful or paradoxical. When properly explained and un-
derstood,itisalmostself-evident.
668 [16] When we talk of any particular sum of money, we sometimes mean
nothing but the metal pieces of which it is composed; and sometimes we
include in our meaning some obscure reference to the goods which can be
hadinexchangeforit,ortothepowerofpurchasingwhichthepossession
ofitconveys. ThuswhenwesaythatthecirculatingmoneyofEnglandhas
been computed at eighteen millions, we mean only to express the amount
of the metal pieces, which some writers have computed, or rather have
supposed to circulate in that country. But when we say that a man is
worthfiftyorahundredpoundsayear,wemeancommonlytoexpressnot
only the amount of the metal pieces which are annually paid to him, but
the value of the goods which he can annually purchase or consume. We
meancommonlytoascertainwhatisoroughttobehiswayofliving,orthe
quantity and quality of the necessaries and conveniencies of life in which
hecanwithproprietyindulgehimself.
669 [17] When, by any particular sum of money, we mean not only to express G.ed.p290
the amount of the metal pieces of which it is composed, but to include in
224 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
its signification some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in
exchange for them, the wealth or revenue which it in this case denotes,
isequalonlytooneofthetwovalueswhicharethusintimatedsomewhat
ambiguouslybythesameword,andtothelattermoreproperlythantothe
former,tothemoney’sworthmoreproperlythantothemoney.
670 [18] Thusifaguineabetheweeklypensionofaparticularperson,hecanin
the course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of subsistence,
conveniencies,andamusements. Inproportionasthisquantityisgreator
small, soarehisrealriches, hisrealweeklyrevenue. Hisweeklyrevenue
is certainly not equal both to the guinea, and to what can be purchased
withit,butonlytooneorotherofthosetwoequalvalues;andtothelatter
moreproperlythantotheformer,totheguinea’sworthratherthantothe
guinea.
671 [19] If the pension of such a person was paid to him, not in gold, but in a
weekly bill for a guinea, his revenue surely would not so properly consist
in the piece of paper, as in what he could get for it. A guinea may be
consideredasabillforacertainquantityofnecessariesandconveniencies
upon all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood. The revenue of the person
to whom it is paid, does not so properly consist in the piece of gold, as in
what he can get for it, or in what he can exchange it for. If it could be
exchangedfornothing,itwould,likeabilluponabankrupt,beofnomore
valuethanthemostuselesspieceofpaper.
672 [20] Though the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants
of any country, in the same manner, may be, and in reality frequently is
paidtotheminmoney,theirrealriches,however,therealweeklyoryearly
revenue of all of them taken together, must always be great or small in
proportiontothequantityofconsumablegoodswhichtheycanallofthem
purchasewiththismoney. Thewholerevenueofallofthemtakentogether
is evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable goods; but
only to one or other of those two values, and to the latter more properly
thantotheformer.
673 [21] Though we frequently, therefore, express a person’s revenue by the
metal pieces which are annually paid to him, it is because the amount of
those pieces regulates the extent of his power of purchasing, or the value
ofthegoodswhichhecanannuallyaffordtoconsume. Westillconsiderhis
revenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming, and not
inthepieceswhichconveyit.
674 [22] Butifthisissufficientlyevidentevenwithregardtoanindividual,itis
stillmoresowithregardtoasociety. Theamountofthemetalpieceswhich
areannuallypaidtoanindividual,isoftenpreciselyequaltohisrevenue, G.ed.p291
andisuponthataccounttheshortestandbestexpressionofitsvalue. But
the amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a society can never be
equal to the revenue of all its members. As the same guinea which pays
theweeklypensionofonemanto-day,maypaythatofanotherto-morrow,
andthatofathirdthedaythereafter,theamountofthemetalpieceswhich
225 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
annuallycirculateinanycountrymustalwaysbeofmuchlessvaluethan
the whole money pensions annually paid with them. But the power of
purchasing,orthegoodswhichcansuccessivelybeboughtwiththewhole
of those money pensions as they are successively paid, must always be
precisely of the same value with those pensions; as must likewise be the
revenue of the different persons to whom they are paid. That revenue,
therefore, cannot consist in those metal pieces, of which the amount is so
much inferior to its value, but in the power of purchasing, in the goods
which can successively be bought with them as they circulate from hand
tohand.
675 [23] Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument
of commerce, like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part
and a very valuable part of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of
the society to which it belongs; and though the metal pieces of which it
is composed, in the course of their annual circulation, distribute to every
mantherevenuewhichproperlybelongstohim,theymakethemselvesno
partofthatrevenue.
676 [24] Thirdly, and lastly, the machines and instruments of trade, etc., which
compose the fixed capital, bear this further resemblance to that part of
the circulating capital which consists in money; that as every saving in
the expense of erecting and supporting those machines, which does not
diminish the productive powers of labour, is an improvement of the net
revenue of the society, so every saving in the expense of collecting and
supporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money, is
animprovementofexactlythesamekind.
677 [25] Itissufficientlyobvious,andithaspartly,too,beenexplainedalready, G.ed.p292
inwhatmannereverysavingintheexpenseofsupportingthefixedcapital
is an improvement of the net revenue of the society. The whole capital
of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided between his fixed
and his circulating capital. While his whole capital remains the same,
the smaller the one part, the greater must necessarily be the other. It is
thecirculatingcapitalwhichfurnishesthematerialsandwagesoflabour,
and puts industry into motion. Every saving, therefore, in the expense
of maintaining the fixed capital, which does not diminish the productive
powersoflabour,mustincreasethefundwhichputsindustryintomotion,
andconsequentlytheannualproduceoflandandlabour,therealrevenue
ofeverysociety.
678 [26] Thesubstitutionofpaperintheroomofgoldandsilvermoney,replaces
a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and
sometimesequallyconvenient. Circulationcomestobecarriedonbyanew
wheel, which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one.
But in what manner this operation is performed, and in what manner it
tends to increase either the gross or the net revenue of the society, is not
altogethersoobvious,andmaythereforerequiresomefurtherexplication.
679 [27] There are several different sorts of paper money; but the circulating
226 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
notesofbanksandbankersarethespecieswhichisbestknown,andwhich
seemsbestadaptedforthispurpose.
680 [28] Whenthepeopleofanyparticularcountryhavesuchconfidenceinthe
fortune, probity, and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that
he is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissory notes as
are likely to be at any time presented to him; those notes come to have
thesamecurrencyasgoldandsilvermoney,fromtheconfidencethatsuch
moneycanatanytimebehadforthem.
681 [29] A particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory
notes, to the extent, we shall suppose, of a hundred thousand pounds.
As those notes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the
same interest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the
sourceofhisgain. Thoughsomeofthosenotesarecontinuallycomingback
upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months and
years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore, notes
to the extent of a hundred thousand pounds, twenty thousand pounds in
gold and silver may frequently be a sufficient provision for answering oc- G.ed.p293
casional demands. By this operation, therefore, twenty thousand pounds
in gold and silver perform all the functions which a hundred thousand
could otherwise have performed. The same exchanges may be made, the
same quantity of consumable goods may be circulated and distributed to
theirproperconsumers,bymeansofhispromissorynotes,tothevalueofa
hundred thousand pounds, as by an equal value of gold and silver money.
Eightythousandpoundsofgoldandsilver,therefore,can,inthismanner,
be spared from the circulation of the country; and if different operations
of the same kind should, at the same time, be carried on by many differ-
entbanksandbankers,thewholecirculationmaythusbeconductedwith
a fifth part only of the gold and silver which would otherwise have been
requisite.
682 [30] Letussuppose, forexample, thatthewholecirculatingmoneyofsome
particularcountryamounted,ataparticulartime,toonemillionsterling,
thatsumbeingthensufficientforcirculatingthewholeannualproduceof
their land and labour. Let us suppose, too, that some time thereafter, dif-
ferent banks and bankers issued promissory notes, payable to the bearer,
totheextentofonemillion,reservingintheirdifferentcofferstwohundred

therefore,incirculation,eighthundredthousandpoundsingoldandsilver,
andamillionofbanknotes,oreighteenhundredthousandpoundsofpaper
andmoneytogether. Buttheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthe
country had before required only one million to circulate and distribute it
to its proper consumers, and that annual produce cannot be immediately
augmentedbythoseoperationsofbanking. Onemillion,therefore,willbe
sufficienttocirculateitafterthem. Thegoodstobeboughtandsoldbeing
preciselythesameasbefore,thesamequantityofmoneywillbesufficient
forbuyingandsellingthem. Thechannelofcirculation,ifImaybeallowed
227 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
suchanexpression,willremainpreciselythesameasbefore. Onemillion
we have supposed sufficient to fill that channel. Whatever, therefore, is
poured into it beyond this sum cannot run in it, but must overflow. One
millioneighthundredthousandpoundsarepouredintoit. Eighthundred G.ed.p294
thousandpounds,therefore,mustoverflow,thatsumbeingoverandabove
what can be employed in the circulation of the country. But though this
sum cannot be employed at home, it is too valuable to be allowed to lie
idle. Itwill, therefore, besentabroad,inordertoseekthatprofitableem-
ployment which it cannot find at home. But the paper cannot go abroad;
becauseatadistancefromthebankswhichissueit,andfromthecountry
inwhichpaymentofitcanbeexactedbylaw,itwillnotbereceivedincom-
monpayments. Goldandsilver,therefore,totheamountofeighthundred
thousandpoundswillbesentabroad,andthechannelofhomecirculation
will remain filled with a million of paper, instead of the million of those
metalswhichfilleditbefore.
683 [31] Butthoughsogreataquantityofgoldandsilveristhussentabroad,we
mustnotimaginethatitissentabroadfornothing,orthatitsproprietors
make a present of it to foreign nations. They will exchange it for foreign
goods of some kind or another, in order to supply the consumption either
ofsomeotherforeigncountryoroftheirown.
684 [32] Iftheyemployitinpurchasinggoodsinoneforeigncountryinorderto
supplytheconsumptionofanother,orinwhatiscalledthecarryingtrade,
whatever profit they make will be an addition to the net revenue of their
own country. It is like a new fund, created for carrying on a new trade;
domestic business being now transacted by paper, and the gold and silver
beingconvertedintoafundforthisnewtrade.
685 [33] If they employ it in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption,
theymayeither,first,purchasesuchgoodsasarelikelytobeconsumedby
idlepeoplewhoproducenothing, suchasforeignwines, foreignsilks, etc.;
or, secondly, they may purchase an additional stock of materials, tools,
and provisions, in order to maintain and employ an additional number of
industriouspeople,whoreproduce,withaprofit,thevalueoftheirannual
consumption.
686 [34] So far as it is employed in the first way, it promotes prodigality, in-
creasesexpenseandconsumptionwithoutincreasingproduction,orestab-
lishing any permanent fund for supporting that expense, and is in every
respecthurtfultothesociety.
687 [35] So far as it is employed in the second way, it promotes industry; and
thoughitincreasestheconsumptionofthesociety,itprovidesapermanent G.ed.p295
fund for supporting that consumption, the people who consume reprodu-
cing,withaprofit,thewholevalueoftheirannualconsumption. Thegross
revenue of the society, the annual produce of their land and labour, is in-

materials upon which they are employed; and their net revenue by what
228 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

688 [36] Thatthegreaterpartofthegoldandsilverwhich,beingforcedabroad
bythoseoperationsofbanking,isemployedinpurchasingforeigngoodsfor
home consumption, is and must be employed in purchasing those of this
second kind, seems not only probable but almost unavoidable. Though
some particular men may sometimes increase their expense very consid-
erably though their revenue does not increase at all, we may be assured
that no class or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles

they always influence that of the majority of every class or order. But the
revenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot, in the smal-
lestdegree,beincreasedbythoseoperationsofbanking. Theirexpensein
general,therefore,cannotbemuchincreasedbythem,thoughthatofafew
individualsamongthemmay,andinrealitysometimesis. Thedemandof
idlepeople,therefore,forforeigngoodsbeingthesame,orverynearlythe
same,asbefore,averysmallpartofthemoney,whichbeingforcedabroad
bythoseoperationsofbanking,isemployedinpurchasingforeigngoodsfor
home consumption, is likely to be employed in purchasing those for their
use. The greater part of it will naturally be destined for the employment
ofindustry,andnotforthemaintenanceofidleness.
689 [37] When we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating cap-
ital of any society can employ, we must always have regard to those parts
of it only which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work: the
other, which consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those
three, must always be deducted. In order to put industry into motion,
threethingsarerequisite;materialstoworkupon,toolstoworkwith,and
thewagesorrecompenseforthesakeofwhichtheworkisdone. Moneyis
neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the
wages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real rev-
enue,likethatofallothermen,consists,notinmoney,butinthemoney’s
worth;notinthemetalpieces,butinwhatcanbegotforthem.
690 [38] Thequantityofindustrywhichanycapitalcanemploymust,evidently,
be equal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials,
tools, and a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work. Money may
berequisiteforpurchasingthematerialsandtoolsofthework,aswellas
the maintenance of the workmen. But the quantity of industry which the
whole capital can employ is certainly not equal both to the money which G.ed.p296
purchases, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are pur-
chased with it; but only to one or other of those two values, and to the
lattermoreproperlythantotheformer.
691 [39] When paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the
quantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole circu-
latingcapitalcansupply,maybeincreasedbythewholevalueofgoldand
silver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole value
229 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the goods
which are circulated and distributed by means of it. The operation, in
somemeasure,resemblesthatoftheundertakerofsomegreatwork,who,
inconsequenceofsomeimprovementinmechanics,takesdownhisoldma-
chinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new to
hiscirculatingcapital, tothefundfromwhichhefurnishesmaterialsand

692 [40] What is the proportion which the circulating money of any country
bears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it,
it is, perhaps, impossible to determine. It has been computed by different
authorsatafifth,atatenth,atatwentieth,andatathirtiethpartofthat
value. But how small soever the proportion which the circulating money
may bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and
frequentlybutasmallpart,ofthatproduce,iseverdestinedforthemain-
tenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable proportion
to that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper, the gold and
silver necessary for circulation is reduced to, perhaps, a fifth part of the
formerquantity,ifthevalueofonlythegreaterpartoftheotherfour-fifths

and,consequently,tothevalueoftheannualproduceoflandandlabour.
693 [41] An operation of this kind has, within these five-and-twenty or thirty
years,beenperformedinScotland,bytheerectionofnewbankingcompan-
ies in almost every considerable town, and even in some country villages.
The effects of it have been precisely those above described. The business
ofthecountryisalmostentirelycarriedonbymeansofthepaperofthose
differentbankingcompanies,withwhichpurchasesandpaymentsofkinds
are commonly made. Silver very seldom appears except in the change of
atwentyshillingsbanknote,andgoldstillseldomer. Butthoughthecon-
duct of all those different companies has not been unexceptionable, and
has accordingly required an act of Parliament to regulate it, the country,
notwithstanding, has evidently derived great benefit from their trade. I
have heard it asserted, that the trade of the city of Glasgow doubled in
aboutfifteenyearsafterthefirsterectionofthebanksthere;andthatthe
tradeofScotlandhasmorethanquadrupledsincethefirsterectionofthe
twopublicbanksatEdinburgh, ofwhichtheone, calledtheBankofScot-
land, was established by act of Parliament in 1695; the other, called the
Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727. Whether the trade, either of Scot-
land in general, or the city of Glasgow in particular, has really increased
insogreataproportion,duringsoshortaperiod,Idonotpretendtoknow.
If either of them has increased in this proportion, it seems to be an effect
too great to be accounted for by the sole operation of this cause. That the
tradeandindustryofScotland,however,haveincreasedveryconsiderably
duringthisperiod,andthatthebankshavecontributedagooddealtothis
increase,cannotbedoubted.

694 [42] The value of the silver money which circulated in Scotland before the G.ed.p298
union,in1707,andwhich,immediatelyafterit,wasbroughtintotheBank
of Scotland in order to be recoined, amounted to 411,117l.10s.9d. sterling.
Noaccounthasbeengotofthegoldcoin;butitappearsfromtheancientac-
counts of the mint of Scotland, that the value of the gold annually coined
somewhat exceeded that of the silver1. There were a good many people,
too,uponthisoccasion,who,fromadiffidenceofrepayment,didnotbring
their silver into the Bank of Scotland: and there was, besides, some Eng-
lish coin which was not called in. The whole value of the gold and silver,
therefore, which circulated in Scotland before the union, cannot be estim-
atedatlessthanamillionsterling. Itseemstohaveconstitutedalmostthe
whole circulation of that country; for though the circulation of the Bank
of Scotland, which had then no rival, was considerable, it seems to have
made but a very small part of the whole. In the present times the whole
circulation of Scotland cannot be estimated at less than two millions, of
which that part which consists in gold and silver most probably does not
amount to half a million. But though the circulating gold and silver of
Scotland have suffered so great a diminution during this period, its real
riches and prosperity do not appear to have suffered any. Its agriculture,
manufactures, and trade, on the contrary, the annual produce of its land
andlabour,haveevidentlybeenaugmented.
695 [43] It is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange, that is, by advancing
money upon them before they are due, that the greater part of banks and
bankersissuetheirpromissorynotes. Theydeductalways,uponwhatever
sum they advance, the legal interest till the bill shall become due. The
paymentofthebill,whenitbecomesdue,replacestothebankthevalueof
what had been advanced, together with a clear profit of the interest. The
banker who advances to the merchant whose bill he discounts, not gold
and silver, but his own promissory notes, has the advantage of being able
todiscounttoagreateramount,bythewholevalueofhispromissorynotes, G.ed.p299
which he finds by experience are commonly in circulation. He is thereby
enabledtomakehiscleargainofinterestonsomuchalargersum.

more inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were estab-
lished,andthosecompanieswouldhavehadbutlittletradehadtheycon-
finedtheirbusinesstothediscountingofbillsofexchange. Theyinvented,
therefore, another method of issuing their promissory notes; by granting
what they called cash accounts, that is by giving credit to the extent of a

believe, commonly granted by banks and bankers in all different parts of
the world. But the easy terms upon which the Scotch banking companies
acceptofrepaymentare,sofarasIknow,peculiartothem,andhave,per-
haps, beentheprincipalcause, bothofthegreattradeofthosecompanies
andofthebenefitwhichthecountryhasreceivedfromit.
697 [45] Whoeverhasacreditofthiskindwithoneofthosecompanies,andbor-
rows a thousand pounds upon it, for example, may repay this sum piece-
meal, by twenty and thirty pounds at a time, the company discounting a
proportionablepartoftheinterestofthegreatsumfromthedayonwhich
eachofthosesmallsumsispaidintillthewholebeinthismannerrepaid.
All merchants, therefore, and almost all men of business, find it conveni-
ent to keep such cash accounts with them, and are thereby interested to
promote the trade of those companies, by readily receiving their notes in
all payments, and by encouraging all those with whom they have any in-
fluencetodothesame. Thebanks,whentheircustomersapplytothemfor
money,generallyadvanceittothemintheirownpromissorynotes. These
the merchants pay away to the manufacturers for goods, the manufactur-
ers to the farmers for materials and provisions, the farmers to their land-
lordsforrent, thelandlordsrepaythemtothemerchantsfortheconveni-

place what they may have borrowed of them; and thus almost the whole
moneybusinessofthecountryistransactedbymeansofthem. Hencethe
greattradeofthosecompanies.
698 [46] By means of those cash accounts every merchant can, without im-
prudence, carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do. If there
are two merchants, one in London and the other in Edinburgh, who em- G.ed.p300
ploy equal stocks in the same branch of trade, the Edinburgh merchant
can, without imprudence, carry on a greater trade and give employment
to a greater number of people than the London merchant. The London
merchant must always keep by him a considerable sum of money, either
in his own coffers, or in those of his banker, who gives him no interest
for it, in order to answer the demands continually coming upon him for
payment of the goods which he purchases upon credit. Let the ordinary
amount of this sum be supposed five hundred pounds. The value of the
goods in his warehouse must always be less by five hundred pounds than
it would have been had he not been obliged to keep such a sum unem-
ployed. Letussupposethathegenerallydisposesofhiswholestockupon
hand, or of goods to the value of his whole stock upon hand, once in the
year. By being obliged to keep so great a sum unemployed, he must sell
in a year five hundred pounds’ worth less goods than he might otherwise
havedone. Hisannualprofitsmustbelessbyallthathecouldhavemade
by the sale of five hundred pounds worth more goods; and the number of
people employed in preparing his goods for the market must be less by
all those that five hundred pounds more stock could have employed. The
232 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
merchant in Edinburgh, on the other hand, keeps no money unemployed
for answering such occasional demands. When they actually come upon
him,hesatisfiesthemfromhiscashaccountwiththebank,andgradually
replaces the sum borrowed with the money or paper which comes in from
the occasional sales of his goods. With the same stock, therefore, he can,
without imprudence, have at all times in his warehouse a larger quantity
ofgoodsthantheLondonmerchant;andcantherebybothmakeagreater
profit himself, and give constant employment to a greater number of in-
dustriouspeoplewhopreparethosegoodsforthemarket. Hencethegreat
benefitwhichthecountryhasderivedfromthistrade.
699 [47] The facility of discounting bills of exchange it may be thought indeed,
gives the English merchants a conveniency equivalent to the cash ac-
counts of the Scotch merchants. But the Scotch merchants, it must be
remembered, can discount their bills of exchange as easily as the English
merchants;andhave,besides,theadditionalconveniencyoftheircashac-
counts.
700 [48] Thewholepapermoneyofeverykindwhichcaneasilycirculateinany
country never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it sup-
plies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would
circulate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes, for
example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of
that currency which can easily circulate there cannot exceed the sum of
gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual ex-
changes of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within
that country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, G.ed.p301
as the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circu-
lation of the country, it must immediately return upon the banks to be
exchanged for gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive
thattheyhadmoreofthispaperthanwasnecessaryfortransactingtheir
business at home, and as they could not send it abroad, they would im-
mediately demand payment of it from the banks. When this superfluous
paper was converted into gold and silver, they could easily find a use for
it by sending it abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the
shape of paper. There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the
banks to the whole extent of this superfluous paper, and, if they showed
any difficulty or backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the
alarmwhichthiswouldoccasionnecessarilyincreasingtherun.
701 [49] Over and above the expenses which are common to every branch of
trade; such as the expense of house-rent, the wages of servants, clerks,
accountants, etc.; the expenses peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in two
articles: first, in the expense of keeping at all times in its coffers, for an-
swering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes, a large sum
of money, of which it loses the interest; and, secondly, in the expense of
replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied by answering such
occasionaldemands.
233 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
702 [50] Abankingcompany,whichissuesmorepaperthancanbeemployedin
the circulation of the country, and of which the excess is continually re-
turninguponthemforpayment,oughttoincreasethequantityofgoldand

to this excessive increase of their circulation, but in a much greater pro-
portion;theirnotesreturninguponthemmuchfasterthaninproportionto
the excess of their quantity. Such a company, therefore, ought to increase
the first article of their expense, not only in proportion to this forced in-
creaseoftheirbusiness,butinamuchgreaterproportion.
703 [51] Thecoffersofsuchacompanytoo,thoughtheyoughttobefilledmuch
fuller, yet must empty themselves much faster than if their business was
confined within more reasonable bounds, and must require, not only a
more violent, but a more constant and uninterrupted exertion of expense
in order to replenish them. The coin too, which is thus continually drawn
insuchlargequantitiesfromtheircoffers,cannotbeemployedinthecircu-
lationofthecountry. Itcomesinplaceofapaperwhichisoverandabove

what can be employed in it too. But as that coin will not be allowed to lie
idle,itmust,inoneshapeoranother,besentabroad,inordertofindthat
profitable employment which it cannot find at home; and this continual G.ed.p302
exportation of gold and silver, by enhancing the difficulty, must necessar-
ily enhance still further the expense of the bank, in finding new gold and
silver in order to replenish those coffers, which empty themselves so very
rapidly. Such a company, therefore, must, in proportion to this forced in-
crease of their business, increase the second article of their expense still
morethanthefirst.
704 [52] Let us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank, which the cir-
culation of the country can easily absorb and employ, amounts exactly to
forty thousand pounds; and that for answering occasional demands, this
bank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in
goldandsilver. Shouldthisbankattempttocirculateforty-fourthousand
pounds,thefourthousandpoundswhichareoverandabovewhatthecir-

705 [53] Had every particular banking company always understood and atten-
ded to its own particular interest, the circulation never could have been
overstockedwithpapermoney. Buteveryparticularbankingcompanyhas

706 [54] By issuing too great a quantity of paper, of which the excess was con-
tinually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, the Bank
of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the ex-
tent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a year; or
at an average, about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds. For this
great coinage the bank (in consequence of the worn and degraded state
intowhichthegoldcoinhadfallenafewyearsago)wasfrequentlyobliged
to purchase gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce, which
it soon after issued in coin at 3l.17s.101d. an ounce, losing in this man-
2
nerbetweentwoandahalfandthreepercentuponthecoinageofsovery
large a sum. Though the bank therefore paid no seignorage, though the
government was properly at the expense of the coinage, this liberality of
governmentdidnotpreventaltogethertheexpenseofthebank.
707 [55] The Scotch banks, in consequence of an excess of the same kind, were G.ed.p303
all obliged to employ constantly agents at London to collect money for
them, at an expense which was seldom below one and a half or two per
cent. Thismoneywassentdownbythewaggon,andinsuredbythecarri-
ers at an additional expense of three quarters per cent or fifteen shillings
on the hundred pounds. Those agents were not always able to replenish
the coffers of their employers so fast as they were emptied. In this case
the resource of the banks was to draw upon their correspondents in Lon-
don bills of exchange to the extent of the sum which they wanted. When
those correspondents afterwards drew upon them for the payment of this
sum, together with the interest and a commission, sonic of those banks,
from the distress into which their excessive circulation had thrown them,
hadsometimesnoothermeansofsatisfyingthisdraughtbutbydrawinga

708 [56] ThegoldcoinwhichwaspaidouteitherbytheBankofEngland,orby
the Scotch banks, in exchange for that part of their paper which was over
andabovewhatcouldbeemployedinthecirculationofthecountry, being
likewise over and above what could be employed in that circulation, was
sometimes sent abroad in the shape of coin, sometimes melted down and
sent abroad in the shape of bullion, and sometimes melted down and sold
to the Bank of England at the high price of four pounds an ounce. It was
the newest, the heaviest, and the best pieces only which were carefully
picked out of the whole coin, and either sent abroad or melted down. At
home, and while they remained in the shape of coin, those heavy pieces
wereofnomorevaluethanthelight. Buttheywereofmorevalueabroad,
or when melted down into bullion, at home. The Bank of England, not-
235 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
withstandingtheirgreatannualcoinage,foundtotheirastonishmentthat
there was every year the same scarcity of coin as there had been the year
before; and that notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new coin
which was every year issued from the bank, the state of the coin, instead
of growing better and better, became every year worse and worse. Every
yeartheyfoundthemselvesunderthenecessityofcoiningnearlythesame
quantityofgoldastheyhadcoinedtheyearbefore,andfromthecontinual
rise in the price of gold bullion, in consequence of the continual wearing
and clipping of the coin, the expense of this great annual coinage became
everyyeargreaterandgreater. TheBankofEngland,itistobeobserved,
by supplying its own coffers with coin, is indirectly obliged to supply the G.ed.p304
whole kingdom, into which coin is continually flowing from those coffers
in a great variety of ways. Whatever coin therefore was wanted to sup-
port this excessive circulation both of Scotch and English paper money,
whatever vacuities this excessive circulation occasioned in the necessary
coin of the kingdom, the Bank of England was obliged to supply them.
The Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own
imprudence and inattention. But the Bank of England paid very dearly,
not only for its own imprudence, but for the much greater imprudence of
almostalltheScotchbanks.
709 [57] The overtrading of some bold projectors in both parts of the United
Kingdom was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper
money.

considerable part of that capital; but that part of it only which he would

it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced,
together with the interest. The coffers of the bank, so far as its dealings
areconfinedtosuchcustomers,resembleawaterpond,fromwhich,though
astreamiscontinuallyrunningout,yetanotheriscontinuallyrunningin,
fully equal to that which runs out; so that, without any further care or
attention, the pond keeps always equally, or very near equally full. Little
or no expense can ever be necessary for replenishing the coffers of such a
bank.
236 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
712 [60] A merchant, without overtrading, may frequently have occasion for a
sumofreadymoney,evenwhenhehasnobillstodiscount. Whenabank, G.ed.p305
besides discounting his bills, advances him likewise upon such occasions
such sums upon his cash account, and accepts of a piecemeal repayment
asthemoneycomesinfromtheoccasionalsaleofhisgoods,upontheeasy
termsofthebankingcompaniesofScotland;itdispenseshimentirelyfrom
the necessity of keeping any part of his stock by him unemployed and in
ready money for answering occasional demands. When such demands ac-
tually come upon him, he can answer them sufficiently from his cash ac-
count. The bank, however, in dealing with such customers, ought to ob-
serve with great attention, whether in the course of some short period (of
four, five, six, or eight months for example) the sum of the repayments
which it commonly receives from them is, or is not, fully equal to that of
the advances which it commonly makes to them. If, within the course of
such short periods, the sum of the repayments from certain customers is,
uponmostoccasions,fullyequaltothatoftheadvances,itmaysafelycon-
tinue to deal with such customers. Though the stream which is in this
casecontinuallyrunningoutfromitscoffersmaybeverylarge,thatwhich
is continually running into them must be at least equally large; so that
without any further care or attention those coffers are likely to be always
equallyorverynearequallyfull;andscarceevertorequireanyextraordin-
ary expense to replenish them. If, on the contrary, the sum of the repay-
mentsfromcertainothercustomersfallscommonlyverymuchshortofthe
advances which it makes to them, it cannot with any safety continue to
deal with such customers, at least if they continue to deal with it in this
manner. Thestreamwhichisinthiscasecontinuallyrunningoutfromits
coffers is necessarily much larger than that which is continually running
in;sothat,unlesstheyarereplenishedbysomegreatandcontinualeffort
ofexpense,thosecoffersmustsoonbeexhaustedaltogether.
713 [61] The banking companies of Scotland, accordingly, were for a long time
verycarefultorequirefrequentandregularrepaymentsfromalltheircus-
tomers, and did not care to deal with any person, whatever might be his
fortuneorcredit,whodidnotmake,whattheycalled,frequentandregular
operationswiththem. Bythisattention,besidessavingalmostentirelythe
extraordinaryexpenseofreplenishingtheircoffers,theygainedtwoother
veryconsiderableadvantages.
714 [62] First,bythisattentiontheywereenabledtomakesometolerablejudg-
ment concerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors,
withoutbeingobligedtolookoutforanyotherevidencebesideswhattheir
own books afforded them; men being for the most part either regular or
irregularintheirrepayments,accordingastheircircumstancesareeither
thriving or declining. A private man who lends out his money to perhaps
half a dozen or a dozen of debtors, may, either by himself or his agents,
observe and inquire both constantly and carefully into the conduct and G.ed.p306
situation of each of them. But a banking company, which lends money to
237 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
perhaps five hundred different people, and of which the attention is con-
tinually occupied by objects of a very different kind, can have no regular
informationconcerningtheconductandcircumstancesofthegreaterpart
of its debtors beyond what its own books afford it. In requiring frequent
and regular repayments from all their customers, the banking companies
ofScotlandhadprobablythisadvantageinview.
715 [63] Secondly, by this attention they secured themselves from the possibil-
ity of issuing more paper money than what the circulation of the country
could easily absorb and employ. When they observed that within moder-
ate periods of time the repayments of a particular customer were upon
most occasions fully equal to the advances which they had made to him,
they might be assured that the paper money which they had advanced to
him had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which
he would otherwise have been obliged to keep by him for answering occa-
sionaldemands;andthat,consequently,thepapermoney,whichtheyhad
circulatedbyhismeans,hadnotatanytimeexceededthequantityofgold
and silver which would have circulated in the country had there been no
paper money. The frequency, regularity, and amount of his repayments
would sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their advances had at
no time exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwise have
been obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answer-
ing occasional demands; that is, for the purpose of keeping the rest of his
capital in constant employment. It is this part of his capital only which,
withinmoderateperiodsoftime,iscontinuallyreturningtoeverydealerin
theshapeofmoney,whetherpaperorcoin,andcontinuallygoingfromhim
in the same shape. If the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded
this part of his capital, the ordinary amount of his repayments could not,
within moderate periods of time, have equalled the ordinary amount of
its advances. The stream which, by means of his dealings, was continu-
allyrunningintothecoffersofthebank, couldnothavebeenequaltothe
streamwhich,bymeansofthesamedealings,wascontinuallyrunningout.
Theadvancesofthebankpaper,byexceedingthequantityofgoldandsil-
verwhich,hadtherebeennosuchadvances,hewouldhavebeenobligedto

thewholequantityofgoldandsilverwhich(thecommercebeingsupposed

money; and consequently to exceed the quantity which the circulation of
the country could easily absorb and employ; and the excess of this paper

wasnotperhapssowellunderstoodbyallthedifferentbankingcompanies

and in ready money for answering occasional demands, they can reason-
ablyexpectnofartherassistancefrombanksandbankers,who,whenthey
havegonethusfar,cannot,consistentlywiththeirowninterestandsafety,
go farther. A bank cannot, consistently with its own interest, advance to
a trader the whole or even the greater part of the circulating capital with
which he trades; because, though that capital is continually returning to
him in the shape of money, and going from him in the same shape, yet
the whole of the returns is too distant from the whole of the outgoings,
and the sum of his repayments could not equal the sum of its advances
within such moderate periods of time as suit the conveniency of a bank.
Still less, could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his
fixed capital; of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge, for ex-
ample, employs in erecting his forge and smelting-house, his workhouses
and warehouses, the dwelling-houses of his workmen, etc.; of the capital

the easy terms of the banking companies of Scotland, would, no doubt,
be a very convenient creditor to such traders and undertakers. But such
traders and undertakers would, surely, be most inconvenient debtors to
suchabank.

sued by the different banking companies of Scotland was fully equal, or

and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks, which did not, they
said,extendtheircreditsinproportiontotheextensionofthetradeofthe
country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension of that trade the extension
of their own projects beyond what they could carry on, either with their
own capital, or with what they had credit to borrow of private people in
theusualwayofbondormortgage. Thebanks,theyseemtohavethought,
wereinhonourboundtosupplythedeficiency,andtoprovidethemwithall
thecapitalwhichtheywantedtotradewith. Thebanks, however, wereof
a different opinion, and upon their refusing to extend their credits, some
of those traders had recourse to an expedient which, for a time, served
theirpurpose,thoughatamuchgreaterexpense,yetaseffectuallyasthe
utmost extension of bank credits could have done. This expedient was no
other than the well-known shift of drawing and redrawing; the shift to
which unfortunate traders have sometimes recourse when they are upon
thebrinkofbankruptcy. Thepracticeofraisingmoneyinthismannerhad
been long known in England, and during the course of the late war, when
thehighprofitsoftradeaffordedagreattemptationtoovertrading,issaid
to have carried on to a very great extent. From England it was brought
into Scotland, where, in proportion to the very limited commerce, and to
theverymoderatecapitalofthecountry, itwassooncarriedontoamuch
greaterextentthaniteverhadbeeninEngland.
718 [66] The practice of drawing and redrawing is so well known to all men of
business that it may perhaps be thought unnecessary to give any account G.ed.p309

to bills of exchange that money is more readily advanced upon them than

723 [71] The paper which was issued upon those circulating bills of exchange,
amounted, upon many occasions, to the whole fund destined for carrying
on some vast and extensive project of agriculture, commerce, or manufac-
tures; and not merely to that part of it which, had there been no paper
money,theprojectorwouldhavebeenobligedtokeepbyhim,unemployed
and in ready money for answering occasional demands. The greater part
of this paper was, consequently, over and above the value of the gold and
silver which would have circulated in the country, had there been no pa-
per money. It was over and above, therefore, what the circulation of the
country could easily absorb and employ, and upon that account, immedi-
atelyreturneduponthebanksinordertobeexchangedforgoldandsilver,

it for their interest to assist one another in this method of raising money,
and to render it, upon that account, as difficult as possible to distinguish
between a real and fictitious bill of exchange; between a bill drawn by a
real creditor upon a real debtor, and a bill for which there was properly
no realcreditor butthe bankwhich discountedit, nor any real debtorbut
the projector who made use of the money. When a banker had even made
this discovery, he might sometimes make it too late, and might find that
hehadalreadydiscountedthebillsofthoseprojectorstosogreatanextent
that, by refusing to discount any more, he would necessarily make them
allbankrupts,andthus,byruiningthem,mightperhapsruinhimself. For
his own interest and safety, therefore, he might find it necessary, in this
very perilous situation, to go on for some time, endeavouring, however, to
withdrawgradually,anduponthataccountmakingeverydaygreaterand
greater difficulties about discounting, in order to force those projectors by
degrees to have recourse, either to other bankers, or to other methods of
raising money; so that he himself might, as soon as possible, get out of
thecircle. Thedifficulties,accordingly,whichtheBankofEngland,which
theprincipalbankersinLondon,andwhicheventhemoreprudentScotch
banksbegan, afteracertaintime, andwhenallofthemhadalreadygone
too far, to make about discounting, not only alarmed, but enraged in the
243 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
highestdegreethoseprojectors. Theirowndistress,ofwhichthisprudent
andnecessaryreserveofthebankswas,nodoubt,theimmediateoccasion,
they called the distress of the country; and this distress of the country,
they said, was altogether owing to the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad
conduct of the banks, which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to the
spirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to beau-
tify, improve, and enrich the country. It was the duty of the banks, they
seemed to think, to lend for as long a time, and to as great an extent as
they might wish to borrow. The banks, however, by refusing in this man-
ner to give more credit to those to whom they had already given a great
deal too much, took the only method by which it was now possible to save
eithertheirowncreditorthepubliccreditofthecountry.
725 [73] In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established G.ed.p313
in Scotland for the express purpose of relieving the distress of the coun-
try. The design was generous; but the execution was imprudent, and the
nature and causes of the distress which it meant to relieve were not, per-
haps,wellunderstood. Thisbankwasmoreliberalthananyotherhadever
been,bothingrantingcashaccounts,andindiscountingbillsofexchange.
With regard to the latter, it seems to have made scarce any distinction
between real and circulating bills, but to have discounted all equally. It
wastheavowedprincipleofthisbanktoadvance,uponanyreasonablese-
curity,thewholecapitalwhichwastobeemployedinthoseimprovements
of which the returns are the most slow and distant, such as the improve-
ments of land. To promote such improvements was even said to be the
chiefofthepublic-spiritedpurposesforwhichitwasinstituted. Byitslib-
erality in granting cash accounts, and in discounting bills of exchange, it,
no doubt, issued great quantities of its bank notes. But those bank notes
being,thegreaterpartofthem,overandabovewhatthecirculationofthe
country could easily absorb and employ, returned upon it, in order to be
exchangedforgoldandsilverasfastastheywereissued. Itscofferswere
never well filled. The capital which had been subscribed to this bank at
two different subscriptions, amounted to one hundred and sixty thousand
pounds,ofwhicheightypercentonlywaspaidup. Thissumoughttohave

had the coffers of this bank been filled ever so well, its excessive circula-
tionmusthaveemptiedthemfasterthantheycouldhavebeenreplenished
by any other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing upon London, and G.ed.p314
when the bill became due, paying it, together with interest and commis-
sion, by another draft upon the same place. Its coffers having been filled
244 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
so very ill, it is said to have been driven to this resource within a very
few months after it began to do business. The estates of the proprietors
of this bank were worth several millions, and by their subscription to the
originalbondorcontractofthebank,werereallypledgedforansweringall
itsengagements. Bymeansofthegreatcreditwhichsogreatapledgene-
cessarilygaveit,itwas,notwithstandingitstooliberalconduct,enabledto
carryonbusinessformorethantwoyears. Whenitwasobligedtostop,it
hadinthecirculationabouttwohundredthousandpoundsinbanknotes.
In order to support the circulation of those notes which were continually
returning upon it as fast they were issued, it had been constantly in the
practice of drawing bills of exchange upon London, of which the number
and value were continually increasing, and, when it stopped, amounted
to upwards of six hundred thousand pounds. This bank, therefore, had,
in little more than the course of two years, advanced to different people
upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds at five per cent. Upon the
two hundred thousand pounds which it circulated in bank notes, this five
per cent might, perhaps, be considered as clear gain, without any other
deduction besides the expense of management. But upon upwards of six
hundredthousandpounds,forwhichitwascontinuallydrawingbillsofex-
changeuponLondon,itwaspaying,inthewayofinterestandcommission,
upwards of eight per cent, and was consequently losing more than three
percentuponmorethanthree-fourthsofallitsdealings.

ite to those which were intended by the particular persons who planned
anddirectedit. Theyseemtohaveintendedtosupportthespiritedunder-
takings, for as such they considered them, which were at that time carry-

thewholebankingbusinesstothemselves,tosupplantalltheotherScotch G.ed.p315
banks, particularly those established in Edinburgh, whose backwardness
in discounting bills of exchange had given some offence. This bank, no
doubt, gave some temporary relief to those projectors, and enabled them
tocarryontheirprojectsforabouttwoyearslongerthantheycouldother-
wise have done. But it thereby only enabled them to get so much deeper
into debt, so that, when ruin came, it fell so much the heavier both upon
them and upon their creditors. The operations of this bank, therefore, in-
steadofrelieving,inrealityaggravatedinthelong-runthedistresswhich
those projectors had brought both upon themselves and upon their coun-
try. It would have been much better for themselves, their creditors, and
their country, had the greater part of them been obliged to stop two years
sooner than they actually did. The temporary relief, however, which this
bank afforded to those projectors, proved a real and permanent relief to
the other Scotch banks. All the dealers in circulating bills of exchange,
which those other banks had become so backward in discounting, had re-
coursetothisnewbank,wheretheywerereceivedwithopenarms. Those
other banks, therefore, were enabled to get very easily out of that fatal
245 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
circle, from which they could not otherwise have disengaged themselves
without incurring a considerable loss, and perhaps too even some degree
ofdiscredit.
727 [75] Inthelong-run,therefore,theoperationsofthisbankincreasedthereal
distress of the country which it meant to relieve; and effectually relieved
fromaverygreatdistressthoserivalswhomitmeanttosupplant.
728 [76] At the first setting out of this bank, it was the opinion of some people
that how fast soever its coffers might be emptied, it might easily replen-
ish them by raising money upon the securities of those to whom it had
advanced its paper. Experience, I believe, soon convinced them that this
method of raising money was by much too slow to answer their purpose;

as fast as they wanted it, yet, instead of making a profit, they must have
suffered a loss by every such operation; so that in the long-run they must
haveruinedthemselvesasamercantilecompany,though,perhaps,notso
soon as by the more expensive practice of drawing and redrawing. They
could still have made nothing by the interest of the paper, which, being
over and above what the circulation of the country could absorb and em-
ploy, returned upon them, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver, as

no stream was continually running, but who proposed to keep it always

it.
729 [77] But though this operation had proved not only practicable but prof-
itable to the bank as a mercantile company, yet the country could have
derivednobenefitfromit; but,onthecontrary,musthavesufferedavery
considerable loss by it. This operation could not augment in the smal-
lest degree the quantity of money to be lent. It could only have erected
this bank into a sort of general loan office for the whole country. Those
who wanted to borrow must have applied to this bank instead of apply-
ing to the private persons who had lent it their money. But a bank which
lends money perhaps to five hundred different people, the greater part of
whom its directors can know very little about, is not likely to be more ju-
246 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
dicious in the choice of its debtors than a private person who lends out
his money among a few people whom he knows, and in whose sober and
frugal conduct he thinks he has good reason to confide. The debtors of
such a bank as that whose conduct I have been giving some account of
werelikely,thegreaterpartofthem,tobechimericalprojectors,thedraw-
ers and re-drawers ofcirculating bills of exchange, who would employ the
money in extravagant undertakings, which, with all the assistance that
could be given them, they would probably never be able to complete, and
which, if they should be completed, would never repay the expense which
they had really cost, would never afford a fund capable of maintaining a
quantityoflabourequaltothatwhichhadbeenemployedaboutthem. The
soberandfrugaldebtorsofprivatepersons,onthecontrary,wouldbemore
likely to employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were G.ed.p317
proportioned to their capitals, and which, though they might have less of
the grand and the marvellous, would have more of the solid and the prof-
itable, which would repay with a large profit whatever had been laid out
upon them, and which would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a
muchgreaterquantityoflabourthanthatwhichhadbeenemployedabout
them. The success of this operation, therefore, without increasing in the
smallest degree the capital of the country, would only have transferred a
greatpartofitfromprudentandprofitabletoimprudentandunprofitable
undertakings.
730 [78] That the industry of Scotland languished for want of money to employ
it was the opinion of the famous Mr. Law. By establishing a bank of a
particular kind, which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to
theamountofthewholevalueofallthelandsinthecountry,heproposed
to remedy this want of money. The Parliament of Scotland, when he first
proposedhisproject,didnotthinkpropertoadoptit. Itwasafterwardsad-
opted, with some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at that time Regent
of France. The idea of the possibility of multiplying paper to almost any
extent was the real foundation of what is called the Mississippi scheme,
the most extravagant project both of banking and stock-jobbing that, per-
haps, the world ever saw. The different operations of this scheme are ex-
plained so fully, so clearly, and with so much order and distinctness, by
Mr. Du Verney, in his Examination of the Political Reflections upon Com-
merce and Finances of Mr. Du Tot, that I shall not give any account of
them. TheprinciplesuponwhichitwasfoundedareexplainedbyMr.Law
himself, in a discourse concerning money and trade, which he published
inScotlandwhenhefirstproposedhisproject. Thesplendidbutvisionary
ideaswhicharesetforthinthatandsomeotherworksuponthesameprin-
ciples still continue to make an impression upon many people, and have,
perhaps, in part, contributed to that excess of banking which has of late G.ed.p318
beencomplainedofbothinScotlandandinotherplaces.
731 [79] The Bank of England is the greatest bank of circulation in Europe. It
wasincorporated,inpursuanceofanactofParliament,byacharterunder
247 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the Great Seal, dated the 27th of July, 1694. It at that time advanced to
government the sum of one million two hundred thousand pounds, for an
annuity of one hundred thousand pounds; or for 96,000l. a year interest,
attherateofeightpercent,and4.000l.ayearfortheexpenseofmanage-
ment. The credit of the new government, established by the Revolution,
wemaybelieve,musthavebeenverylow,whenitwasobligedtoborrowat
sohighaninterest.
732 [80] In 1697 the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock by an en-
graftmentof1,001,171l.10s.Itswholecapitalstocktherefore,amountedat
this time to 2,201,171l.10s. This engraftment is said to have been for the
support of public credit. In 1696, tallies had been at forty, and fifty, and
sixty per cent discount, and bank notes at twenty per cent3. During the
greatrecoinageofthesilver,whichwasgoingonatthistime,thebankhad
thought proper to discontinue the payment of its notes, which necessarily
occasionedtheirdiscredit.
733 [81] In pursuance of the 7th Anne, c.vii., the bank advanced and paid into
the exchequer the sum of 400,000l.; making in all the sum of 1,600,000l.
which it had advanced upon its original annuity of 96,000l. interest and
4,000l. for expense of management. In 1708, therefore, the credit of gov- G.ed.p319
ernmentwasasgoodasthatofprivatepersons,sinceitcouldborrowatsix
percentinterestthecommonlegalandmarketrateofthosetimes. Inpur-
suance of the same act, the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the amount
of 1,775,027l.17s.101d. at six per cent interest, and was at the same time
2
allowed to take in subscriptions for doubling its capital. In 1708, there-
fore, the capital of the bank amounted to 4,402,343l.; and it had advanced
togovernmentthesumof3,375,027l.17s.101d.
2
734 [82] By a call of fifteen per cent in 1709, there was paid in and made stock
656,204l.1s.9d.; and by another of ten per cent in 1710, 501,448l.12s.11d.
Inconsequenceofthosetwocalls,therefore,thebankcapitalamountedto
5,559,995l.14s.8d.
735 [83] In pursuance of the 3rd George I, c.8, the bank delivered up two mil-
lions of exchequer bills to be cancelled. It had at this time, therefore, ad-
vancedtogovernment5,375,027l.17s.10d.Inpursuanceofthe8thGeorgeI,
c.21, the bank purchased of the South Sea Company stock to the amount
of 4,000,000l.; and in 1722, in consequence of the subscriptions which it
had taken in for enabling it to make this purchase, its capital stock was
increased by 3,400,000l. At this time, therefore, the bank had advanced
to the public 9,375,027l.17s.101d.; and its capital stock amounted only to
2
8,959,995l.14s.8d. It was upon this occasion that the sum which the bank
had advanced to the public, and for which it received interest, began first
to exceed its capital stock, or the sum for which it paid a dividend to the
proprietors of bank stock; or, in other words, that the bank began to have
an undivided capital, over and above its divided one. It has continued

to have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since. In 1746, the

its divided capital had been raised by different calls and subscriptions to
10,780,000l.Thestateofthosetwosumshascontinuedtobethesameever

to government for the renewal of its charter 110,000l. without interest or
repayment. Thissum,therefore,didnotincreaseeitherofthosetwoother

736 [84] The dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in the

This rate of interest has gradually been reduced from eight to three per G.ed.p320

percent.

creditorscansustainanyloss. NootherbankingcompanyinEnglandcan
be established by act of Parliament, or can consist of more than six mem-
bers. It acts, not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state.
It receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to
the creditors of the public, it circulates exchequer bills, and it advances
to government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes, which are
frequently not paid up till some years thereafter. In those different oper-
ations, its duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it, without any
faultofitsdirectors,tooverstockthecirculationwithpapermoney. Itlike-
wisediscountsmerchants’bills,andhas,uponseveraldifferentoccasions,
supported the credit of the principal houses, not only of England, but of
Hamburg and Holland. Upon one occasion, in 1763, it is said to have ad-
vanced for this purpose, in one week, about 1,600,000l.; a great part of it
in bullion. I do not, however, pretend to warrant either the greatness of
the sum, or the shortness of the time. Upon other occasions, this great
companyhasbeenreducedtothenecessityofpayinginsixpences.
738 [86] It is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a
greaterpartofthatcapitalactiveandproductivethanwouldotherwisebe
so,thatthemostjudiciousoperationsofbankingcanincreasetheindustry
ofthecountry. Thatpartofhiscapitalwhichadealerisobligedtokeepby
him unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands,
is so much dead stock, which, so long as it remains in this situation, pro-
duces nothing either to him or to his country. The judicious operations of
banking enable him to convert this dead stock into active and productive
stock; into materials to work upon, into tools to work with, and into pro-
visions and subsistence to work for; into stock which produces something
both to himself and to his country. The gold and silver money which cir-
culatesinanycountry, andbymeansofwhichtheproduceofitslandand
labour is annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers, is,
249 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
inthesamemannerasthereadymoneyofthedealer,alldeadstock. Itis
a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing G.ed.p321
tothecountry. Thejudiciousoperationsofbanking,bysubstitutingpaper
in the room of a great part of this gold and silver, enables the country to
convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock;
into stock which produces something to the country. The gold and silver
money which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to
a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass
and corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either. The ju-
dicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent
a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to
convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pastures and
corn-fields, and thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce
ofitslandandlabour. Thecommerceandindustryofthecountry,however,

the capital, and consequently of that treasure which supported the credit

where the whole circulation was carried on by paper, than in one where
the greater part of it was carried on by gold and silver. The usual instru-
ment of commerce having lost its value, no exchanges could be made but
eitherbybarteroruponcredit. Alltaxeshavingbeenusuallypaidinpaper

state in which he can most easily defend them, ought, upon this account,
to guard, not only against that excessive multiplication of paper money
whichruinstheverybankswhichissueit;butevenagainstthatmultiplic-
ation of it which enables them to fill the greater part of the circulation of
thecountrywithit.
740 [88] Thecirculationofeverycountrymaybeconsideredasdividedintotwo G.ed.p322
different branches: the circulation of the dealers with one another, and
the circulation between the dealers and the consumers. Though the same
pieces of money, whether paper or metal, may be employed sometimes
in the one circulation and sometimes in the other, yet as both are con-
stantly going on at the same time, each requires a certain stock of money
of one kind or another to carry it on. The value of the goods circulated
between the different dealers, never can exceed the value of those circu-
250 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
lated between the dealers and the consumers; whatever is bought by the
dealers, being ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers. The circu-
lationbetweenthedealers,asitiscarriedonbywholesale,requiresgener-
allyaprettylargesumforeveryparticulartransaction. Thatbetweenthe
dealersandtheconsumers,onthecontrary,asitisgenerallycarriedonby
retail, frequently requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a half-
penny, being often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster than
largeones. Ashillingchangesmastersmorefrequentlythanaguinea,and
ahalfpennymorefrequentlythanashilling. Thoughtheannualpurchases
of all the consumers, therefore, are at least equal in value to those of all
the dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much smaller quant-
ity of money; the same pieces, by a more rapid circulation, serving as the
instrumentofmanymorepurchasesoftheonekindthanoftheother.
741 [89] Paper money may be so regulated as either to confine itself very much
tothecirculationbetweenthedifferentdealers,ortoextenditselflikewise
to a great part of that between the dealers and the consumers. Where no
bank notes are circulated under ten pounds value, as in London, paper
money confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers.
When a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer, he is
generally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has occasion to
purchase five shillings’ worth of goods, so that it often returns into the
hands of a dealer before the consumer has spent the fortieth part of the
money. Wherebanknotesareissuedforsosmallsumsastwentyshillings,
as in Scotland, paper money extends itself to a considerable part of the
circulationbetweendealersandconsumers. BeforetheActofParliament,
whichputastoptothecirculationoftenandfiveshillingnotes, itfilleda
still greater part of that circulation. In the currencies of North America,
paper was commonly issued for so small a sum as a shilling, and filled
almostthewholeofthatcirculation. InsomepapercurrenciesofYorkshire,
itwasissuedevenforsosmallasumasasixpence.

743 [91] It were better, perhaps, that no bank notes were issued in any part of
thekingdomforasmallersumthanfivepounds. Papermoneywouldthen,
probably, confine itself, in every part of the kingdom, to the circulation
between the different dealers, as much as it does at present in London,
wherenobanknotesareissuedundertenpounds’value;fivepoundsbeing,
in most parts of the kingdom, a sum which, though it will purchase, little
251 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
more than half the quantity of goods, is as much considered, and is as
seldom spent all at once, as ten pounds are amidst the profuse expense of
London.
744 [92] Where paper money, it is to be observed, is pretty much confined to
thecirculationbetweendealersanddealers,asatLondon,thereisalways
plenty of gold and silver. Where it extends itself to a considerable part
ofthecirculationbetweendealersandconsumers,asinScotland,andstill
moreinNorthAmerica,itbanishesgoldandsilveralmostentirelyfromthe

thus carried on by paper. The suppression of ten and five shilling bank

suppression of twenty shilling notes would probably relieve it still more.

havebeenmoreabundantbeforetheinstitutionofthosecurrencies.
745 [93] Thoughpapermoneyshouldbeprettymuchconfinedtothecirculation
between dealers and dealers, yet banks and bankers might still be able
to give nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the
country as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole cir-
culation. The ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him, for
answering occasional demands, is destined altogether for the circulation
between himself and other dealers of whom he buys goods. He has no
occasion to keep any by him for the circulation between himself and the
consumers, who are his customers, and who bring ready money to him,
instead of taking any from him. Though no paper money, therefore, was
allowed to be issued but for such sums as would confine it pretty much
to the circulation between dealers and dealers, yet, partly by discounting G.ed.p324
real bills of exchange, and partly by lending upon cash accounts, banks

746 [94] To restrain private people, it may be said, from receiving in payment
the promissory notes of a banker, for any sum whether great or small,
whentheythemselvesarewillingtoreceivethem, ortorestrainabanker
from issuing such notes, when all his neighbours are willing to accept of
them, is a manifest violation of that natural liberty which it is the proper
business of law not to infringe, but to support. Such regulations may, no
doubt,beconsideredasinsomerespectsaviolationofnaturalliberty. But
those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might
endangerthesecurityofthewholesociety,are,andoughttobe,restrained
by the laws of all governments, of the most free as well as of the most
despotical. The obligation of building party walls, in order to prevent the
252 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
communication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty exactly of the same
kindwiththeregulationsofthebankingtradewhicharehereproposed.
747 [95] Apapermoneyconsistinginbanknotes,issuedbypeopleofundoubted
credit, payable upon demand without any condition, and in fact always
readily paid as soon as presented, is, in every respect, equal in value to
goldandsilvermoney;sincegoldandsilvermoneycanatanytimebehad
for it. Whatever is either bought or sold for such paper must necessarily
beboughtorsoldascheapasitcouldhavebeenforgoldandsilver.
748 [96] The increase of paper money, it has been said, by augmenting the
quantity, and consequently diminishing the value of the whole currency,
necessarily augments the money price of commodities. But as the quant-
ity of gold and silver, which is taken from the currency, is always equal
to the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does not ne-
cessarilyincreasethequantityofthewholecurrency. Fromthebeginning
of the last century to the present time, provisions never were cheaper in
Scotland than in 1759, though, from the circulation of ten and five shil-
ling bank notes, there was then more paper money in the country than
atpresent. TheproportionbetweenthepriceofprovisionsinScotlandand

ingcompaniesinScotland. Cornis,uponmostoccasions,fullyascheapin

land, and scarce any in France. In 1751 and in 1752, when Mr. Hume
published hisPolitical Discourses, and soon after the greatmultiplication
of paper money in Scotland, there was a very sensible rise in the price of
provisions, owing, probably, to the badness of the seasons, and not to the
multiplicationofpapermoney.
749 [97] Itwouldbeotherwise,indeed,withapapermoneyconsistinginpromis-
sory notes, of which the immediate payment depended, in any respect,
either upon the good will of those who issued them, or upon a condition
whichtheholderofthenotesmightnotalwayshaveitinhispowertoful-
fil; orofwhichthepaymentwasnotexigibletillafteracertainnumberof
years, and which in the meantime bore no interest. Such a paper money
would, no doubt, fall more or less below the value of gold and silver, ac-
cording as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate payment
was supposed to be greater or less; or according to the greater or less dis-
tanceoftimeatwhichpaymentwasexigible.
750 [98] SomeyearsagothedifferentbankingcompaniesofScotlandwereinthe
practice of inserting into their bank notes, what they called an Optional
Clause, by which they promised payment to the bearer, either as soon as
thenoteshouldbepresented,or,intheoptionofthedirectors,sixmonths
after such presentment, together with the legal interest for the said six
months. The directors of some of those banks sometimes took advantage
of this optional clause, and sometimes threatened those who demanded
gold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their notes that
they Would take advantage of it, unless such demanders would content
253 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
themselves with a part of what they demanded. The promissory notes
of those banking companies constituted at that time the far greater part
ofthecurrencyofScotland,whichthisuncertaintyofpaymentnecessarily
degradedbelowthevalueofgoldandsilvermoney. Duringthecontinuance
of this abuse (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763, and 1764), while the G.ed.p326
exchange between London and Carlisle was at par, that between London
andDumfrieswouldsometimesbefourpercentagainstDumfries,though
this town is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle. But at Carlisle, bills
werepaidingoldandsilver;whereasatDumfriestheywerepaidinScotch
banknotes,andtheuncertaintyofgettingthosebanknotesexchangedfor
goldandsilvercoinhadthusdegradedthemfourpercentbelowthevalue
of that coin. The same Act of Parliament which suppressed ten and five
shilling bank notes suppressed likewise this optional clause, and thereby
restored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural rate,
ortowhatthecourseoftradeandremittancesmighthappentomakeit.
751 [99] In the paper currencies of Yorkshire, the payment of so small a sum
as a sixpence sometimes depended upon the condition that the holder of
the note should bring the change of a guinea to the person who issued it;
a condition which the holders of such notes might frequently find it very
difficult to fulfil, and which must have degraded this currency below the
valueofgoldandsilvermoney. AnActofParliamentaccordinglydeclared
allsuchclausesunlawful,andsuppressed,inthesamemannerasinScot-
land, all promissory notes, payable to the bearer, under twenty shillings
value.
752 [100] The paper currencies of North America consisted, not in bank notes
payable to the bearer on demand, but in government paper, of which the
paymentwasnotexigibletillseveralyearsafteritwasissued;andthough
the colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper, they
declaredittobe,andinfactrenderedit,alegaltenderofpaymentforthe
full value for which it was issued. But allowing the colony security to be
perfectlygood,ahundredpoundspayablefifteenyearshence,forexample,
in a country where interest at six per cent, is worth little more than forty
pounds ready money. To oblige a creditor, therefore, to accept of this as
full payment for a debt of a hundred pounds actually paid down in ready
money was an act of such violent injustice as has scarce, perhaps, been
attempted by the government of any other country which pretended to be
free. It bears the evident marks of having originally been, what the hon-
est and downright Doctor Douglas assures us it was, a scheme of fraud-
ulent debtors to cheat their creditors. The government of Pennsylvania,
indeed, pretended, upon their first emission of paper money, in 1722, to
render their paper of equal value with gold and silver by enacting penal- G.ed.p327
ties against all those who made any difference in the price of their goods
whentheysoldthemforacolonypaper,andwhentheysoldthemforgold
and silver; a regulation equally tyrannical, but much less effectual than
that which it was meant to support. A positive law may render a shil-
254 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ling a legal tender for guinea, because it may direct the courts of justice
to discharge the debtor who has made that tender. But no positive law
can oblige a person who sells goods, and who is at liberty to sell or not to
sell as he pleases, to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea in the
price of them. Notwithstanding any regulation of this kind, it appeared
bythecourseofexchangewithGreatBritain,thatahundredpoundsster-
ling was occasionally considered as equivalent, in some of the colonies, to
a hundred and thirty pounds, and in others to so great a sum as eleven
hundredpoundscurrency;thisdifferenceinthevaluearisingfromthedif-
ferenceinthequantityofpaperemittedinthedifferentcolonies,andinthe
distanceandprobabilityofthetermofitsfinaldischargeandredemption.
753 [101] No law, therefore, could be more equitable than the Act of Parliament,
so unjustly complained of in the colonies, which declared that no paper
currency to be emitted there in time coming should be a legal tender of
payment.
754 [102] Pennsylvania was always more moderate in its emissions of paper
money than any other of our colonies. Its paper currency, accordingly, is
said never to have sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was
current in the colony before the first emission of its paper money. Before
thatemission,thecolonyhadraisedthedenominationofitscoin,andhad,
by act of assembly, ordered five shillings sterling to pass in the colony for
sixandthreepence,andafterwardsforsixandeightpence. Apoundcolony
currency,therefore,evenwhenthatcurrencywasgoldandsilver,wasmore

called the Agio of the bank of Amsterdam, or for the superiority of bank
moneyovercurrentmoney;thoughthisbankmoney,astheypretend,can-
not be taken out of the bank at the will of the owner. The greater part of
foreignbillsofexchangemustbepaidinbankmoney,thatis,byatransfer
in the books of the bank; and the directors of the bank, they allege, are
carefultokeepthewholequantityofbankmoneyalwaysbelowwhatthis
use occasions a demand for. It is upon this account, they say, that bank
money sells for a premium, or bears an agio of four or five per cent above

which is necessary in order to bring a certain quantity of gold and silver
to market, and that which is necessary in order to bring thither a certain
quantityofanyothersortofgoods.
758 [106] If bankers are restrained from issuing any circulating bank notes, or
notes payable to the bearer, for less than a certain sum, and if they are
subjectedtotheobligationofanimmediateandunconditionalpaymentof
such bank notes as soon as presented, their trade may, with safety to the
public, berenderedinallotherrespectsperfectlyfree. Thelatemultiplic-
ationofbankingcompaniesinbothpartsoftheUnitedKingdom,anevent
by which many people have been much alarmed, instead of diminishing,
increases the security of the public. It obliges all of them to be more cir-
cumspectintheirconduct,and,bynotextendingtheircurrencybeyondits

runs which the rivalship of so many competitors is always ready to bring
uponthem. Itrestrainsthecirculationofeachparticularcompanywithin

By dividing the whole circulation into a greater number of parts, the fail-
ure of any one company, an accident which, in the course of things, must
sometimes happen, becomes of less consequence to the public. This free
competition, too, obliges all bankers to be more liberal in their dealings
withtheircustomers,lesttheirrivalsshouldcarrythemaway. Ingeneral,
if any branch of trade, or any division of labour, be advantageous to the
256 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
public, the freer and more general the competition, it will always be the
moreso.
257 CHAPTER III
G.ed.p330
OF THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, OR
OF PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE
LABOUR
759 [1] THERE is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject upon
whichitisbestowed: thereisanotherwhichhasnosucheffect. Theformer,
asitproducesavalue,maybecalledproductive; thelatter,unproductive1
labour. Thus thelabour ofa manufactureradds, generally, tothe valueof
the materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance, and of
hismaster’sprofit. Thelabourofamenialservant,onthecontrary,addsto
thevalueofnothing. Thoughthemanufacturerhashiswagesadvancedto
him by his master, he, in reality, costs him no expense, the value of those
wages being generally restored, together with a profit, in the improved
value of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed. But the mainten-
anceofamenialservantneverisrestored. Amangrowsrichbyemploying
a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor by maintaining a multitude
of menial servants. The labour of the latter, however, has its value, and
deserves its reward as well as that of the former. But the labour of the
manufacturer fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject or vend-
iblecommodity,whichlastsforsometimeatleastafterthatlabourispast.
It is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up to be
employed, if necessary, upon some other occasion. That subject, or what
is the same thing, the price of that subject, can afterwards, if necessary,
put into motion a quantity of labour equal to that which had originally
produced it. The labour of the menial servant, on the contrary, does not
fix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible commodity. His
servicesgenerallyperishintheveryinstantoftheirperformance,andsel-
dom leave any trace or value behind them for which an equal quantity of
servicecouldafterwardsbeprocured.
760 [2] Thelabourofsomeofthemostrespectableordersinthesocietyis,like
thatofmenialservants,unproductiveofanyvalue,anddoesnotfixorreal-
izeitselfinanypermanentsubject;orvendiblecommodity,whichendures

after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of labour could
afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with all the officers G.ed.p331
both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole army and navy,
are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public, and are
maintainedbyapartoftheannualproduceoftheindustryofotherpeople.
Their service, how honourable, how useful, or how necessary soever, pro-
duces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can afterwards be
procured. The protection, security, and defence of the commonwealth, the
effect of their labour this year will not purchase its protection, security,
anddefencefortheyeartocome. Inthesameclassmustberanked,some
both of the gravest and most important, and some of the most frivolous
professions: churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters of all kinds;
players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc. The la-
bour of the meanest of these has a certain value, regulated by the very
sameprincipleswhichregulatethatofeveryothersortoflabour;andthat
of the noblest and most useful, produces nothing which could afterwards
purchase or procure an equal quantity of labour. Like the declamation of
theactor,theharangueoftheorator,orthetuneofthemusician,thework
ofallofthemperishesintheveryinstantofitsproduction.
761 [3] Both productive and unproductive labourers, and those who do not la- G.ed.p332
bour at all, are all equally maintained by the annual produce of the land
and labour of the country. This produce, how great soever, can never be
infinite, but must have certain limits. According, therefore, as a smaller
orgreaterproportionofitisinanyoneyearemployedinmaintainingun-
productive hands, the more in the one case and the less in the other will
remain for the productive, and the next year’s produce will be greater or
smaller accordingly; the whole annual produce, if we except the spontan-
eousproductionsoftheearth,beingtheeffectofproductivelabour.
762 [4] Thoughthewholeannualproduceofthelandandlabourofeverycoun-
try is, no doubt, ultimately destined for supplying the consumption of its
inhabitants, and for procuring a revenue to them, yet when it first comes
either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, it
naturally divides itself into two parts. One of them, and frequently the
largest, is, in the first place, destined for replacing a capital, or for re-
newingtheprovisions,materials,andfinishedwork,whichhadbeenwith-
drawn from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue either to the
ownerofthiscapital,astheprofitofhisstock,ortosomeotherperson,as
the rent of his land. Thus, of the produce of land, one part replaces the
capital of the farmer; the other pays his profit and the rent of the land-
lord; and thus constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this capital, as
the profits of his stock; and to some other person, as the rent of his land.
Oftheproduceofagreatmanufactory,inthesamemanner,onepart,and
thatalwaysthelargest,replacesthecapitaloftheundertakerofthework;
the other pays his profit, and thus constitutes a revenue to the owner of
thiscapital.
259 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
763 [5] That part of the annual produce of the land and labour of any country
which replaces a capital never is immediately employed to maintain any
but productive hands. It pays the wages of productive labour only. That
which is immediately destined for constituting a revenue, either as profit
or as rent, may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive
hands.
764 [6] Whatever part of his stock a man employs as a capital, he always ex-
pects is to be replaced to him with a profit. He employs it, therefore, in
maintaining productive bands only; and after having served in the func-
tion of a capital to him, it constitutes a revenue to them. Whenever he
employs any part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind,
thatpartis,fromthatmoment,withdrawnfromhiscapital,andplacedin

765 [7] Unproductive labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all G.ed.p333
maintained by revenue; either, first, by that part of the annual produce
which is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular
persons, either as the rent of land or as the profits of stock; or, secondly,
by that part which, though originally destined for replacing a capital and
for maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it comes into their
hands whatever part of it is over and above their necessary subsistence

but even the common workman, if his wages are considerable, may main-

and so contribute his share towards maintaining one set of unproductive
labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus help to maintain another

of the annual produce, however, which had been originally destined to re-
place a capital, is ever directed towards maintaining unproductive hands

one. It is his spare revenue only, of which productive labourers have sel-
domagreatdeal. Theygenerallyhavesome,however;andinthepayment

his capital he maintains industrious people only, yet by his expense, that
260 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is, by the employment of his revenue, he feeds commonly the very same
sortasthegreatlord.
766 [8] The proportion, therefore, between the productive and unproductive
hands, depends very much in every country upon the proportion between G.ed.p334
that part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from
the ground or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined for
replacing a capital, and that which is destined for constituting a revenue,
either as rent or as profit. This proportion is very different in rich from
whatitisinpoorcountries.
767 [9] Thus, at present, in the opulent countries of Europe, a very large, fre-
quentlythelargestportionoftheproduceofthelandisdestinedforrepla-
cing the capital of the rich and independent farmer; the other for paying
his profits and the rent of the landlord. But anciently, during the preval-
ency of the feudal government, a very small portion of the produce was
sufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation. It consisted com-
monlyinafewwretchedcattle,maintainedaltogetherbythespontaneous
produceofuncultivatedland,andwhichmight,therefore,beconsideredas
apartofthatspontaneousproduce. Itgenerally,too,belongedtotheland-
lord, and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the land. All the rest
of the produce properly belonged to him too, either as rent for his land,
or as profit upon this paltry capital. The occupiers of land were generally
bondmen,whosepersonsandeffectswereequallyhisproperty. Thosewho
were not bondmen were tenants at will, and though the rent which they
paid was often nominally little more than a quit-rent, it really amounted
to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could at all times command
their labour in peace and their service in war. Though they lived at a
distancefromhishouse,theywereequallydependentuponhimashisre-
tainers who lived in it. But the whole produce of the land undoubtedly
belongstohimwhocandisposeofthelabourandserviceofallthosewhom
it maintains. In the present state of Europe, the share of the landlord
seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce
of the land. The rent of land, however, in all the improved parts of the
country, has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient times; and
this third or fourth part of the annual produce is, it seems, three or four
timesgreaterthanthewholehadbeenbefore. Intheprogressofimprove-
ment, rent, though it increases in proportion to the extent, diminishes in
proportiontotheproduceoftheland.
768 [10] In the opulent countries of Europe, great capitals are at present em-
ployed in trade and manufactures. In the ancient state, the little trade
thatwasstirring,andthefewhomelyandcoarsemanufacturesthatwere
carried on, required but very small capitals. These, however, must have
yielded very large profits. The rate of interest was nowhere less than ten
per cent, and their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great G.ed.p335
interest. At present the rate of interest, in the improved parts of Europe,
is nowhere higher than six per cent, and in some of the most improved it
261 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is so low as four, three, and two per cent. Though that part of the rev-
enueoftheinhabitantswhichisderivedfromtheprofitsofstockisalways
muchgreaterinrichthaninpoorcountries,itisbecausethestockismuch
greater: inproportiontothestocktheprofitsaregenerallymuchless.
769 [11] That part of the annual produce, therefore, which, as soon as it comes
either from the ground or from the hands of the productive labourers, is
destined for replacing a capital, is not only much greater in rich than in
poor countries, but bears a much greater proportion to that which is im-
mediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as profit.
The funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour are not only
muchgreaterintheformerthaninthelatter,butbearamuchgreaterpro-
portion to those which, though they may be employed to maintain either
productive or unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for the
latter.
770 [12] The proportion between those different funds necessarily determines
in every country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry
or idleness. We are more industrious than our forefathers; because in
the present times the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are
muchgreaterinproportiontothosewhicharelikelytobeemployedinthe
maintenance of idleness than they were two or three centuries ago. Our
ancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry.
It is better, says the proverb, to play for nothing than to work for noth-
ing. In mercantile and manufacturing towns, where the inferior ranks of
people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital, they are in
general industrious, sober, and thriving; as in many English, and in most
Dutch towns. In those towns which are principally supported by the con-
stant or occasional residence of a court, and in which the inferior ranks
of people are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue, they are in
general idle, dissolute, and poor; as at Rome, Versailles, Compiegne, and
Fontainebleu. If you except Rouen and Bordeaux, there is little trade or
industry in any of the parliament towns of France; and the inferior ranks
of people, being elderly maintained by the expense of the members of the
courts of justice, and of those who come to plead before them, are in gen-
eral idle and poor. The great trade of Rouen and Bordeaux seems to be
altogether the effect of their situation. Rouen is necessarily the entrepot
ofalmostallthegoodswhicharebroughteitherfromforeigncountries,or
from the maritime provinces of France, for the consumption of the great G.ed.p336
city of Paris. Bordeaux is in the same manner the entrepot of the wines
which grow upon the banks of the Garonne, and of the rivers which run
into it, one of the richest wine countries in the world, and which seems
to produce the wine fittest for exportation, or best suited to the taste of
foreign nations. Such advantageous situations necessarily attract a great
capitalbythegreatemploymentwhichtheyaffordit;andtheemployment
of this capital is the cause of the industry of those two cities. In the other
parliamenttownsofFrance,verylittlemorecapitalseemstobeemployed
262 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
thanwhatisnecessaryforsupplyingtheirownconsumption;thatis,little
morethanthesmallestcapitalwhichcanbeemployedinthem. Thesame
thingmaybesaidofParis,Madrid,andVienna. Ofthosethreecities,Paris
is by far the most industrious; but Paris itself is the principal market of
allthemanufacturesestablishedatParis,anditsownconsumptionisthe
principal object of all the trade which it carries on. London, Lisbon, and
Copenhagen, are, perhaps, the only three cities in Europe which are both
the constant residence of a court, and can at the same time be considered
as trading cities, or as cities which trade not only for their own consump-
tion, but for that of other cities and countries. The situation of all the
three is extremely advantageous, and naturally fits them to be the entre-
pots of a great part of the goods destined for the consumption of distant
places. Inacitywhereagreatrevenueisspent,toemploywithadvantage
acapitalforanyotherpurposethanforsupplyingtheconsumptionofthat
city is probably more difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of
people have no other maintenance but what they derive from the employ-
ment of such a capital. The idleness of the greater part of the people who
are maintained by the expense of revenue corrupts, it is probable, the in-
dustryofthosewhooughttobemaintainedbytheemploymentofcapital,
and renders it less advantageous to employ a capital there than in other
places. There was little trade or industry in Edinburgh before the union.
When the Scotch Parliament was no longer to be assembled in it, when it
ceased to be the necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry
ofScotland,itbecameacityofsometradeandindustry. Itstillcontinues,

Glasgow, of which the inhabitants are chiefly maintained by the employ-
ment of capital. The inhabitants of a large village, it has sometimes been
observed, afterhavingmadeconsiderableprogressinmanufactures, have
become idle and poor in consequence of a great lord having taken up his
residenceintheirneighbourhood.
771 [13] The proportion between capital and revenue, therefore, seems every- G.ed.p337
wheretoregulatetheproportionbetweenindustryandidleness. Wherever
capital predominates, industry prevails: wherever revenue, idleness.
Every increase or diminution of capital, therefore, naturally tends to in-
creaseordiminishtherealquantityofindustry,thenumberofproductive
hands, andconsequentlytheexchangeablevalueoftheannualproduceof
the land and labour of the country, the real wealth and revenue of all its
inhabitants.
772 [14] Capitals are increased by parsimony, and diminished by prodigality
andmisconduct.
773 [15] Whatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and
eitheremploysithimselfinmaintaininganadditionalnumberofproduct-

interest, that is, for a share of the profits. As the capital of an individual
can be increased only by what he saves from his annual revenue or his
annualgains,sothecapitalofasociety,whichisthesamewiththatofall
theindividualswhocomposeit,canbeincreasedonlyinthesamemanner.
774 [16] Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of
capital. Industry, indeed, provides the subject which parsimony accumu-
lates. Butwhateverindustrymightacquire,ifparsimonydidnotsaveand
storeup,thecapitalwouldneverbethegreater.
775 [17] Parsimony, by increasing the fund which is destined for the mainten-
ance of productive hands, tends to increase the number of those hands
whoselabouraddstothevalueofthesubjectuponwhichitisbestowed. It
tends,therefore,toincreasetheexchangeablevalueoftheannualproduce
of the land and labour of the country. It puts into motion an additional
quantity of industry, which gives an additional value to the annual pro-
duce.
776 [18] What is annually saved is as regularly consumed as what is annually
spent,andnearlyinthesametimetoo;butitisconsumedbyadifferentset G.ed.p338

His revenue, we shall suppose, is paid him in money. Had he spent the
whole, the food, clothing, and lodging, which the whole could have pur-
chased, would have been distributed among the former set of people. By

No part of it can ever afterwards be employed to maintain any but pro-
ductive hands without an evident loss to the person who thus perverts it
fromitsproperdestination.
778 [20] The prodigal perverts it in this manner. By not confining his expense G.ed.p339
withinhisincome,heencroachesuponhiscapital. Likehimwhoperverts
264 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes, he pays the
wages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his forefathers
had, as it were, consecrated to the maintenance of industry. By dimin-
ishing the funds destined for the employment of productive labour, he ne-
cessarily diminishes, so far as it depends upon him, the quantity of that
labour which adds a value to the subject upon which it is bestowed, and,
consequently,thevalueoftheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthe

igalityofsomewasnotcompensatedbythefrugalityofothers,theconduct
of every prodigal, by feeding the idle with the bread of the industrious,
tendsnotonlytobeggarhimself,buttoimpoverishhiscountry.
779 [21] Thoughtheexpenseoftheprodigalshouldbealtogetherinhome-made,
and no part of it in foreign commodities, its effect upon the productive
funds of the society would still be the same. Every year there would still
be a certain quantity of food and clothing, which ought to have main-
tained productive, employed in maintaining unproductive hands. Every
year,therefore,therewouldstillbesomediminutioninwhatwouldother-
wise have been the value of the annual produce of the land and labour of
thecountry.
780 [22] This expense, it may be said indeed, not being in foreign goods, and
not occasioning any exportation of gold and silver, the same quantity of
money would remain in the country as before. But if the quantity of food
and clothing, which were thus consumed by unproductive, had been dis-
tributed among productive hands, they would have reproduced, together
with a profit, the full value of their consumption. The same quantity of
moneywouldinthiscaseequallyhaveremainedinthecountry,andthere
would besides have been a reproduction of an equal value of consumable
goods. Therewouldhavebeentwovaluesinsteadofone.
781 [23] Thesame quantityof money, besides, cannot longremainin anycoun-
try in which the value of the annual produce diminishes. The sole use of
moneyistocirculateconsumablegoods. Bymeansofit,provisions,materi-
als,andfinishedwork,areboughtandsold,anddistributedtotheirproper
consumers. The quantity of money, therefore, which can be annually em- G.ed.p340
ployedinanycountrymustbedeterminedbythevalueoftheconsumable
goods annually circulated within it. These must consist either in the im-
mediate produce of the land and labour of the country itself, or in some-
thing which had been, purchased with some part of that produce. Their
value, therefore, must diminish as the value of that produce diminishes,
and along with it the quantity of money which can be employed in circu-
latingthem. Butthemoneywhichbythisannualdiminutionofproduceis
annuallythrownoutofdomesticcirculationwillnotbeallowedtolieidle.
The interest of whoever possesses it requires that it should be employed.
But having no employment at home, it will, in spite of all laws and pro-
hibitions, be sent abroad, and employed in purchasing consumable goods
which may be of some use at home. Its annual exportation will in this
265 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
manner continue for some time to add something to the annual consump-
tion of the country beyond the value of its own annual produce. What in
the days of its prosperity had been saved from that annual produce, and
employedinpurchasinggoldandsilver,willcontributeforsomelittletime
tosupportitsconsumptioninadversity. Theexportationofgoldandsilver
is,inthiscase,notthecause,buttheeffectofitsdeclension,andmayeven,
forsomelittletime,alleviatethemiseryofthatdeclension.
782 [24] The quantity of money, on the contrary, must in every country natur-
ally increase as the value of the annual produce increases. The value of
theconsumablegoodsannuallycirculatedwithinthesocietybeinggreater
will require a greater quantity of money to circulate them. A part of the
increased produce, therefore, will naturally be employed in purchasing,
wherever it is to be had, the additional quantity of gold and silver ne-
cessary for circulating the rest. The increase of those metals will in this
case be the effect, not the cause, of the public prosperity. Gold and silver
are purchased everywhere in the same manner. The food, clothing, and
lodging,therevenueandmaintenanceofallthosewhoselabourorstockis

topaywillneverbelongwithoutthequantityofthosemetalswhichithas

nooccasionfor.
783 [25] Whatever, therefore, we may imagine the real wealth and revenue of
a country to consist in, whether in the value of the annual produce of its
landandlabour,asplainreasonseemstodictate;orinthequantityofthe

784 [26] The effects of misconduct are often the same as those of prodigality.
Everyinjudiciousandunsuccessfulprojectinagriculture,mines,fisheries, G.ed.p341
trade, or manufactures, tends in the same manner to diminish the funds
destined for the maintenance of productive labour. In every such project,
though the capital is consumed by productive hands only, yet, as by the
injudiciousmannerinwhichtheyareemployedtheydonotreproducethe
full value of their consumption, there must always be some diminution in
whatwouldotherwisehavebeentheproductivefundsofthesociety.

Buttheprinciplewhichpromptstosaveisthedesireofbetteringourcon-

266 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave. In
the whole interval which separates those two moments, there is scarce
perhaps a single instant in which any man is so perfectly and completely
satisfied with his situation as to be without any wish of alteration or im-
provementofanykind. Anaugmentationoffortuneisthemeansbywhich
the greater part of men propose and wish to better their condition. It is
themeansthemostvulgarandthemostobvious;andthemostlikelyway G.ed.p342
of augmenting their fortune is to save and accumulate some part of what
they acquire, either regularly and annually, or upon some extraordinary
occasions. Though the principle of expense, therefore, prevails in almost
allmenuponsomeoccasions, andinsomemenuponalmostalloccasions,
yet in the greater part of men, taking the whole course of their life at an
average, the principle of frugality seems not only to predominate, but to
predominateverygreatly.
787 [29] With regard to misconduct, the number of prudent and successful un-
dertakings is everywhere much greater than that of injudicious and un-
successfulones. Afterallourcomplaintsofthefrequencyofbankruptcies,
theunhappymenwhofallintothismisfortunemakebutaverysmallpart
of the whole number engaged in trade, and all other sorts of business;
not much more perhaps than one in a thousand. Bankruptcy is perhaps
the greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befall an innocent
man. The greater part of men, therefore, are sufficiently careful to avoid
it. Some,indeed,donotavoidit;assomedonotavoidthegallows.
788 [30] Great nations are never impoverished by private, though they some-
times are by public prodigality and misconduct. The whole, or almost the
wholepublicrevenue,isinmostcountriesemployedinmaintainingunpro-

Such people, as they themselves produce nothing, are all maintained by
the produce of other men’s labour. When multiplied, therefore, to an un-
necessarynumber,theymayinaparticularyearconsumesogreatashare
of this produce, as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the product-
ivelabourers,whoshouldreproduceitnextyear. Thenextyear’sproduce,
therefore, will be less than that of the foregoing, and if the same disorder
should continue, that of the third year will be still less than that of the
second. Those unproductive hands, who should be maintained by a part
only of the spare revenue of the people, may consume so great a share of
their whole revenue, and thereby oblige so great a number to encroach
upon their capitals, upon the funds destined for the maintenance of pro-
ductive labour, that all the frugality and good conduct of individuals may
notbeabletocompensatethewasteanddegradationofproduceoccasioned
bythisviolentandforcedencroachment.
789 [31] This frugality and good conduct, however, is upon most occasions, it
267 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
appears from experience, sufficient to compensate, not only the private G.ed.p343
prodigality and misconduct of individuals, but the public extravagance
of government. The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every
mantobetterhiscondition, theprinciplefromwhichpublicandnational,
as well as private opulence is originally derived, is frequently powerful
enough to maintain the natural progress of things towards improvement,

790 [32] The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be in-
creased in its value by no other means but by increasing either the num-

ferent periods, and find, that the annual produce of its land and labour is
evidently greater at the latter than at the former, that its lands are bet-
tercultivated,itsmanufacturesmorenumerousandmoreflourishing,and
its trade more extensive, we may be assured that its capital must have
increased during the interval between those two periods, and that more
must have been added to it by the good conduct of some than had been
taken from it either by the private misconduct of others or by the public
extravagance of government. But we shall find this to have been the case
of almost all nations, in all tolerably quiet and peaceable times, even of
those who have not enjoyed the most prudent and parsimonious govern-
ments. Toformarightjudgmentofit, indeed, wemustcomparethestate
of the country at periods somewhat distant from one another. The pro-
gress is frequently so gradual that, at near periods, the improvement is

791 [33] The annual produce of the land and labour of England, for example,
268 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is certainly much greater than it was, a little more than a century ago,
at the restoration of Charles II. Though, at present, few people, I believe,
doubt of this, yet during this period, five years have seldom passed away
inwhichsomebookorpamphlethasnotbeenpublished,written,too,with
such abilities as to gain some authority with the public, and pretending
to demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was fast declining, that the
country was depopulated, agriculture neglected, manufactures decaying,
and trade undone. Nor have these publications been all party pamphlets,
thewretchedoffspringoffalsehoodandvenality. Manyofthemhavebeen
writtenbyverycandidandveryintelligentpeople,whowrotenothingbut
whattheybelieved,andfornootherreasonbutbecausetheybelievedit.
792 [34] TheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofEngland,again,wascer-
tainly much greater at the Restoration, than we can suppose it to have
beenaboutanhundredyearsbefore,attheaccessionofElizabeth. Atthis
period, too, we have all reason to believe, the country was much more ad-
vanced in improvement than it had been about a century before, towards
the close of the dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster.
Even then it was, probably, in a better condition than it had been at the
NormanConquest,andattheNormanConquestthanduringtheconfusion
oftheSaxonHeptarchy. Evenatthisearlyperiod,itwascertainlyamore

antswerenearlyinthesamestatewiththesavagesinNorthAmerica.
793 [35] In each of those periods, however, there was not only much private
and public profusion, many expensive and unnecessary wars, great per-
version of the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain
unproductivehands;butsometimes,intheconfusionofcivildiscord,such
absolute waste and destruction of stock, as might be supposed, not only
to retard, as it certainly did, the natural accumulation of riches, but to
have left the country, at the end of the period, poorer than at the begin-
ning. Thus, in the happiest and most fortunate period of them all, that
which has passed since the Restoration, how many disorders and misfor-
tunes have occurred, which, could they have been foreseen, not only the
impoverishment,butthetotalruinofthecountrywouldhavebeenexpec-
tedfromthem? ThefireandtheplagueofLondon,thetwoDutchwars,the

a share of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country has,

ing an extraordinary number of unproductive hands. But had not those
wars given this particular direction to so large a capital, the greater part
ofitwouldnaturallyhavebeenemployedinmaintainingproductivehands,
269 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
whose labour would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value of their
consumption. The value of the annual produce of the land and labour of
the country would have been considerably increased by it every year, and
every year’s increase would have augmented still more that of the follow-
ingyear. Morehouseswouldhavebeenbuilt,morelandswouldhavebeen

which had been established before would have been more extended; and
to what height the real wealth and revenue of the country might, by this
time,havebeenraised,itisnotperhapsveryeasyeventoimagine.
794 [36] But though the profusion of government must, undoubtedly, have re-
tardedthenaturalprogressofEnglandtowardswealthandimprovement,
it has not been able to stop it. The annual produce of its land and labour
is, undoubtedly, much greater at present than it was either at the Res-
toration or at the Revolution. The capital, therefore, annually employed
in cultivating this land, and in maintaining this labour, must likewise be
much greater. In the midst of all the exactions of government, this cap-
ital has been silently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality
and good conduct of individuals, by their universal, continual, and unin-
terrupted effort to better their own condition. It is this effort, protected
by law and allowed by liberty to exert itself in the manner that is most
advantageous,whichhasmaintainedtheprogressofEnglandtowardsop-
ulenceand improvementin almostall formertimes, andwhich, itis tobe
hoped, will do so in all future times. England, however, as it has never
been blessed with a very parsimonious government, so parsimony has at G.ed.p346
notimebeenthecharacteristicalvirtueofitsinhabitants. Itisthehighest
impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers, to pre-
tend to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain their
expense, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of
foreignluxuries. Theyarethemselvesalways,andwithoutanyexception,

795 [37] As frugality increases and prodigality diminishes the public capital,
so the conduct of those whose expense just equals their revenue, without
either accumulating or encroaching, neither increases nor diminishes it.
Somemodesofexpense,however,seemtocontributemoretothegrowthof

796 [38] The revenue of an individual may be spent either in things which are

atenorsupportthatofanother,oritmaybespentinthingsmoredurable,
which can therefore be accumulated, and in which every day’s expense

trinkets of different kinds; or, what is most trifling of all, in amassing a
great wardrobe of fine clothes, like the favourite and minister of a great
prince who died a few years ago. Were two men of equal fortune to spend
their revenue, the one chiefly in the one way, the other in the other, the
magnificenceofthepersonwhoseexpensehadbeenchieflyindurablecom-
modities, would be continually increasing, every day’s expense contribut-
ing something to support and heighten the effect of that of the following G.ed.p347
day: that of the other, on the contrary, would be no greater at the end of
theperiodthanatthebeginning. Theformer,too,would,attheendofthe
period, be the richer man of the two. He would have a stock of goods of
some kind or other, which, though it might not be worth all that it cost,
would always be worth something. No trace or vestige of the expense of
the latter would remain, and the effects of ten or twenty years profusion
wouldbeascompletelyannihilatedasiftheyhadneverexisted.
797 [39] As the one mode of expense is more favourable than the other to the
opulenceofanindividual,soisitlikewisetothatofanation. Thehouses,
the furniture, the clothing of the rich, in a little time, become useful to
theinferiorandmiddlingranksofpeople. Theyareabletopurchasethem
whentheirsuperiorsgrowwearyofthem,andthegeneralaccommodation
ofthewholepeopleisthusgraduallyimproved,whenthismodeofexpense
becomes universal among men of fortune. In countries which have long
been rich, you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people in posses-
sion both of houses and furniture perfectly good and entire, but of which
neither the one could have been built, nor the other have been made for
their use. What was formerly a seat of the family of Seymour is now an
inn upon the Bath road. The marriage-bed of James the First of Great
Britain, which his queen brought with her from Denmark as a present fit
forasovereigntomaketoasovereign,was,afewyearsago,theornament
of an alehouse at Dunfermline. In some ancient cities, which either have
beenlongstationary,orhavegonesomewhattodecay,youwillsometimes
scarce find a single house which could have been built for its present in-
habitants. If you go into those houses too, you will frequently find many
excellent,thoughantiquatedpiecesoffurniture,whicharestillveryfitfor
use, and which could as little have been made for them. Noble palaces,
magnificent villas, great collections of books, statues, pictures and other
curiosities,arefrequentlybothanornamentandanhonour,notonlytothe
neighbourhood, but to the whole country to which they belong. Versailles
is an ornament and an honour to France, Stowe and Wilton to England.
Italy still continues to command some sort of veneration by the number
of monuments of this kind which it possesses, though the wealth which
271 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
produced them has decayed, and though the genius which planned them
seemstobeextinguished,perhapsfromnothavingthesameemployment.
798 [40] The expense too, which is laid out in durable commodities, is favour-
able, not only to accumulation, but to frugality. If a person should at any
timeexceedinit,hecaneasilyreformwithoutexposinghimselftothecen-
sure of the public. To reduce very much the number of his servants, to G.ed.p348

have afterwards the courage to reform, till ruin and bankruptcy oblige
them. But if a person has, at any time, been at too great an expense in
building,infurniture,inbooksorpictures,noimprudencecanbeinferred
fromhischanginghisconduct. Thesearethingsinwhichfurtherexpense
isfrequentlyrenderedunnecessarybyformerexpense;andwhenaperson
stops short, he appears to do so, not because he has exceeded his fortune,
butbecausehehassatisfiedhisfancy.
799 [41] The expense, besides, that is laid out in durable commodities gives
maintenance,commonly,toagreaternumberofpeoplethanthatwhichis

and pound weights, and not have lost or thrown away a single ounce of
them. In the one way, besides, this expense maintains productive, in the
other unproductive hands. In the one way, therefore, it increases, in the
other, it does not increase, the exchangeable value of the annual produce
ofthelandandlabourofthecountry.
800 [42] I would not, however, by all this be understood to mean that the one
species of expense always betokens a more liberal or generous spirit than
theother. Whenamanoffortunespendshisrevenuechieflyinhospitality,

ted towards frivolous objects, the little ornaments of dress and furniture,
jewels, trinkets, gewgaws, frequently indicates, not only a trifling, but a
base and selfish disposition. All that I mean is, that the one sort of ex-

The man who borrows in order to spend will soon be ruined, and he who
lends to him will generally have occasion to repent of his folly. To borrow
or to lend for such a purpose, therefore, is in all cases, where gross usury
is out of the question, contrary to the interest of both parties; and though

803 [3] The only people to whom stock is commonly lent, without their being
expectedtomakeanyveryprofitableuseofit,arecountrygentlemenwho
borrow upon mortgage. Even they scarce ever borrow merely to spend.
What they borrow, one may say, is commonly spent before they borrow it.
They have generally consumed so great a quantity of goods, advanced to
them upon credit by shopkeepers and tradesmen, that they find it neces- TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
sary to borrow at interest in order to pay the debt. The capital borrowed
replacesthecapitalsofthoseshopkeepersandtradesmen,whichthecoun-
trygentlemencouldnothavereplacedfromtherentsoftheirestates. Itis G.ed.p351
notproperlyborrowedinordertobespent,butinordertoreplaceacapital
whichhadbeenspentbefore.
804 [4] Almost all loans at interest are made in money, either of paper, or of
gold and silver. But what the borrower really wants, and what the lender
really supplies him with, is not the money, but the money’s worth, or the
goods which it can purchase. If he wants it as a stock for immediate con-
sumption, it is those goods only which he can place in that stock. If he
wants it as a capital for employing industry, it is from those goods only
thattheindustriouscanbefurnishedwiththetools,materials,andmain-
tenance necessary for carrying on their work. By means of the loan, the
lender, as it were, assigns to the borrower his right to a certain portion of
the annual produce of the land and labour of the country to be employed
astheborrowerpleases.
805 [5] The quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of
moneywhichcanbelentatinterestinanycountry,isnotregulatedbythe
valueofthemoney,whetherpaperorcoin,whichservesastheinstrument
ofthedifferentloansmadeinthatcountry,butbythevalueofthatpartof
the annual produce which, as soon as it comes either from the ground, or
from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined not only for repla-
cing a capital, but such a capital as the owner does not care to be at the
troubleofemployinghimself. Assuchcapitalsarecommonlylentoutand
paid back in money, they constitute what is called the monied interest. It
is distinct, not only from the landed, but from the trading and manufac-
turing interests, as in these last the owners themselves employ their own
capitals. Even in the monied interest, however, the money is, as it were,
butthedeedofassignment,whichconveysfromonehandtoanotherthose
capitals which the owners do not care to employ themselves. Those capit-
alsmaybegreaterinalmostanyproportionthantheamountofthemoney
which serves as the instrument of their conveyance; the same pieces of
money successively serving for many different loans, as well as for many
different purchases. A, for example, lends to W a thousand pounds, with
which W immediately purchases of B a thousand pounds’ worth of goods.
Bhavingnooccasionforthemoneyhimself,lendstheidenticalpiecestoX,
withwhichXimmediatelypurchasesofCanotherthousandpounds’worth
of goods. C in the same manner, and for the same reason, lends them to G.ed.p352
Y, who again purchases goods with them of D. In this manner the same
pieces, either of coin or paper, may in the course of a few days, serve as
the instrument of three different loans, and of three different purchases,
eachofwhichis,invalue,equaltothewholeamountofthosepieces. What
the three monied men A, B, and C assign to the three borrowers, W, X,
Y, is the power of making those purchases. In this power consist both the
value and the use of the loans. The stock lent by the three monied men
275 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is equal to the value of the goods which can be purchased with it, and is
three times greater than that of the money with which the purchases are
made. Those loans however, may be all perfectly well secured, the goods
purchased by the different debtors being so employed as, in due time, to
bring back, with a profit, an equal value either of coin or of paper. And
asthesamepiecesofmoneycanthusserveastheinstrumentofdifferent
loans to three, or for the same reason, to thirty times their value, so they
maylikewisesuccessivelyserveastheinstrumentofrepayment.
806 [6] A capital lent at interest may, in this manner, be considered as an as-
signment from the lender to the borrowers of a certain considerable por-
tion of the annual produce; upon condition that the borrower in return
shall, during the continuance of the loan, annually assign to the lender a
smaller portion, called the interest; and at the end of it a portion equally
considerable with that which had originally been assigned to him, called
the repayment. Though money, either coin or paper, serves generally as
the deed of assignment both to the smaller and to the more considerable
portion,itisitselfaltogetherdifferentfromwhatisassignedbyit.
807 [7] In proportion as that share of the annual produce which, as soon as
it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive la-
bourers,isdestinedforreplacingacapital,increasesinanycountry,what
is called the monied interest naturally increases with it. The increase of
thoseparticularcapitalsfromwhichtheownerswishtoderivearevenue,
without being at the trouble of employing them themselves, naturally ac-
companiesthegeneralincreaseofcapitals; or, inotherwords, asstockin-
creases,thequantityofstocktobelentatinterestgrowsgraduallygreater

808 [8] Asthequantityofstocktobelentatinterestincreases,theinterest,or
the price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily dimin-
ishes, not only from those general causes which make the market price
of things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from other
causes which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals increase in
anycountry,theprofitswhichcanbemadebyemployingthemnecessarily
diminish. It becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the G.ed.p353
country a profitable method of employing any new capital. There arises
inconsequence acompetitionbetween different capitals, theowner ofone
endeavouring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by
another. But upon most occasions he can hope to jostle that other out of
thisemploymentbynoothermeansbutbydealinguponmorereasonable
terms. He must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper, but in
order to get it to sell, he must sometimes, too, buy it dearer. The demand
for productive labour, by the increase of the funds which are destined for
maintainingit,growseverydaygreaterandgreater. Labourerseasilyfind

276 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
are in this manner diminished, as it were, at both ends, the price which
can be paid for the use of it, that is, the rate of interest, must necessarily
bediminishedwiththem.
809 [9] Mr. Locke, Mr. Law, and Mr. Montesquieu, as well as many other
writers, seem to have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold G.ed.p354
andsilver,inconsequenceofthediscoveryoftheSpanishWestIndies,was
the real cause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the greater
partofEurope. Thosemetals,theysay,havingbecomeoflessvaluethem-
selves,theuseofanyparticularportionofthemnecessarilybecameofless
value too, and consequently the price which could be paid for it. This no-
tion, which at first sight seems plausible, has been so fully exposed by
Mr. Hume that it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say anything more about
it. The following very short and plain argument, however, may serve to
explain more distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gen-
tlemen.
810 [10] Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent seems to
havebeenthecommonrateofinterestthroughthegreaterpartofEurope.
It has since that time in different countries sunk to six, five, four, and
three per cent. Let us suppose that in every particular country the value
of silverhas sunkprecisely inthe same proportion as therate ofinterest;
andthatinthosecountries,forexample,whereinteresthasbeenreduced
from ten to five per cent, the same quantity of silver can now purchase
justhalfthequantityofgoodswhichitcouldhavepurchasedbefore. This
supposition will not, I believe, be found anywhere agreeable to the truth,
butitisthemostfavourabletotheopinionwhichwearegoingtoexamine;
and even upon this supposition it is utterly impossible that the lowering
ofthevalueofsilvercouldhavethesmallesttendencytolowertherateof
interest. Ifahundredpoundsareinthosecountriesnowofnomorevalue
than fifty pounds were then, ten pounds must now be of no more value G.ed.p355
thanfivepoundswerethen. Whateverwerethecauseswhichloweredthe
value of the capital, the same must necessarily have lowered that of the
interest, and exactly in the same proportion. The proportion between the
valueofthecapitalandthatoftheinterestmusthaveremainedthesame,
thoughtheratehadbeenaltered. Byalteringtherate,onthecontrary,the
proportion between those two values is necessarily altered. If a hundred
pounds now are worth no more than fifty were then, five pounds now can
be worth no more than two pounds ten shillings were then. By reducing
therateofinterest,therefore,fromtentofivepercent,wegivefortheuse
of a capital, which is supposed to be equal to one half of its former value,
an interest which is equal to one fourth only of the value of the former
interest.
811 [11] Any increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities
circulated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect
thantodiminishthevalueofthatmetal. Thenominalvalueofallsortsof
goods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the same
277 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
as before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of sil-
ver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number
of people whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely the
same. The capital of the country would be the same, though a greater
number of pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of
it from one hand to another. The deeds of assignment, like the convey-
ances of a verbose attorney, would be more cumbersome, but the thing
assigned would be precisely the same as before, and could produce only
the same effects. The funds for maintaining productive labour being the
same, the demand for it would be the same. Its price or wages, there-
fore, though nominally greater, would really be the same. They would be
paidinagreaternumberofpiecesofsilver;buttheywouldpurchaseonly
the same quantity of goods. The profits of stock would be the same both
nominallyandreally. Thewagesoflabourarecommonlycomputedbythe
quantity of silver which is paid to the labourer. When that is increased,
therefore, his wages appear to be increased, though they may sometimes
be no greater than before. But the profits of stock are not computed by
the number of pieces of silver with which they are paid, but by the pro-
portion which those pieces bear to the whole capital employed. Thus in a
particular country five shillings a week are said to be the common wages
oflabour,andtenpercentthecommonprofitsofstock. Butthewholecap-
ital of the country being the same as before, the competition between the
different capitals of individuals into which it was divided would likewise
be the same. They would all trade with the same advantages and disad-
vantages. The common proportion between capital and profit, therefore,
wouldbethesame,andconsequentlythecommoninterestofmoney;what G.ed.p356
can commonly be given for the use of money being necessarily regulated
bywhatcancommonlybemadebytheuseofit.
812 [12] Anyincreaseinthequantityofcommoditiesannuallycirculatedwithin
the country, while that of the money which circulated them remained the
same, would, on the contrary, produce many other important effects, be-
sides that of raising the value of the money. The capital of the country,
though it might nominally be the same, would really be augmented. It
mightcontinuetobeexpressedbythesamequantityofmoney,butitwould
command a greater quantity of labour. The quantity of productive labour
whichitcouldmaintainandemploywouldbeincreased,andconsequently
the demand for that labour. Its wages would naturally rise with the de-
mand, and yet might appear to sink. They might be paid with a smaller
quantity of money, but that smaller quantity might purchase a greater
quantity of goods than a greater had done before. The profits of stock
would be diminished both really and in appearance. The whole capital of
thecountrybeingaugmented,thecompetitionbetweenthedifferentcapit-
alsofwhichitwascomposedwouldnaturallybeaugmentedalongwithit.
The owners of those particular capitals would be obliged to content them-
selves with a smaller proportion of the produce of that labour which their
278 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
respective capitals employed. The interest of money, keeping pace always
with the profits of stock, might, in this manner, be greatly diminished,
though the value of money, or the quantity of goods which any particular
sumcouldpurchase,wasgreatlyaugmented.
813 [13] In some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law.
Butassomethingcaneverywherebemadebytheuseofmoney,something
ought everywhere to be paid for the use of it. This regulation, instead of
preventing, has been found from experience to increase the evil of usury;
the debtor being obliged to pay, not only for the use of the money, but for
theriskwhichhiscreditorrunsbyacceptingacompensationforthatuse.
Heisobliged,ifonemaysayso,toinsurehiscreditorfromthepenaltiesof

is lent to government at three per cent and to private people upon a good
securityatfourandfourandahalf,thepresentlegalrate,fivepercent,is
perhapsasproperasany.
815 [15] The legal rate, it is to be observed, though it ought to be somewhat
above, ought not to be much above the lowest market rate. If the legal
rate of interest in Great Britain, for example, was fixed so high as eight
or ten per cent, the greater part of the money which was to be lent would
belenttoprodigalsandprojectors,whoalonewouldbewillingtogivethis
high interest. Sober people, who will give for the use of money no more
than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it, would not
venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country
would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a
profitable and advantageous use of it, and thrown into those which were
most likely to waste and destroy it. Where the legal rate of interest, on
the contrary, is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate, sober
peopleareuniversallypreferred,asborrowers,toprodigalsandprojectors.
Thepersonwholendsmoneygetsnearlyasmuchinterestfromtheformer

817 [17] The ordinary market price of land, it is to be observed, depends every-
where upon the ordinary market rate of interest. The person who has
a capital from which he wishes to derive a revenue, without taking the
troubletoemployithimself, deliberateswhetherheshouldbuylandwith
it or lend it out at interest. The superior security of land, together with
someotheradvantageswhichalmosteverywhereattenduponthisspecies
of property, will generally dispose him to content himself with a smaller
revenue from land than what he might have by lending out his money at
interest. These advantages are sufficient to compensate a certain differ-
ence of revenue; but they will compensate a certain difference only; and
if the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a greater
difference, nobody would buy land, which would soon reduce its ordinary
price. On the contrary, if the advantages should much more than com-
pensatethedifference,everybodywouldbuyland,whichagainwouldsoon G.ed.p359

G.ed.p360
OF THE DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT OF
CAPITALS
818 [1] THOUGHallcapitalsaredestinedforthemaintenanceofproductivelabour
only, yet the quantity of that labour which equal capitals are capable of
putting into motion varies extremely according to the diversity of their
employment; as does likewise the value which that employment adds to
theannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthecountry.
819 [2] A capital may be employed in four different ways: either, first, in pro-
curing the rude produce annually required for the use and consumption
ofthesociety;or,secondly,inmanufacturingandpreparingthatrudepro-
duceforimmediateuseandconsumption;or,thirdly,intransportingeither
the rude or manufactured produce from the places where they abound to
those where they are wanted; or, lastly, in dividing particular portions of
eitherintosuchsmallparcelsassuittheoccasionaldemandsofthosewho
want them. In the first way are employed the capitals of all those who
undertake the improvement or cultivation of lands, mines, or fisheries; in
the second, those of all master manufacturers; in the third, those of all
wholesalemerchants;andinthefourth,thoseofallretailers. Itisdifficult
to conceive that a capital should be employed in any way which may not
beclassedundersomeoneorotherofthosefour.
820 [3] Eachofthesefourmethodsofemployingacapitalisessentiallyneces-
saryeithertotheexistenceorextensionoftheotherthree,ortothegeneral
conveniencyofthesociety.
821 [4] Unless a capital was employed in furnishing rude produce to a certain
degree of abundance, neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could
exist.
822 [5] Unless a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude
produce which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for
use and consumption, it either would never be produced, because there G.ed.p361
couldbenodemandforit;orifitwasproducedspontaneously,itwouldbe
ofnovalueinexchange,andcouldaddnothingtothewealthofthesociety.
823 [6] Unlessacapitalwasemployedintransportingeithertherudeorman-
ufactured produce from the places where it abounds to those where it is
wanted, no more of either could be produced than was necessary for the
consumptionoftheneighbourhood. Thecapitalofthemerchantexchanges TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the surplus produce of one place for that of another, and thus encourages
theindustryandincreasestheenjoymentsofboth.
824 [7] Unless a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain por-
tions either of the rude or manufactured produce into such small parcels
assuittheoccasionaldemandsofthosewhowantthem,everymanwould
beobligedtopurchaseagreaterquantityofthegoodshewantedthanhis
immediateoccasionsrequired. Iftherewasnosuchtradeasabutcher,for
example, every man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox or a whole
sheep at a time. This would generally be inconvenient to the rich, and
much more so to the poor. If a poor workman was obliged to purchase a

heemploysasacapitalintheinstrumentsofhistrade,orinthefurniture
of his shop, and which yields him a revenue. he would be forced to place
inthatpartofhisstockwhichisreservedforimmediateconsumption,and
which yields him no revenue. Nothing can be more convenient for such
a person than to be able to purchase his subsistence from day to day, or
even from hour to hour, as he wants it. He is thereby enabled to employ
almost his whole stock as a capital. He is thus enabled to furnish work
to a greater value, and the profit, which he makes by it in this way, much

imposes upon the goods. The prejudices of some political writers against
shopkeepersandtradesmenarealtogetherwithoutfoundation. Sofarisit
from being necessary either to tax them or to restrict their numbers that
they can never be multiplied so as to hurt the public, though they may so
as to hurt one another. The quantity of grocery goods, for example, which
canbesoldinaparticulartownislimitedbythedemandofthattownand
its neighbourhood. The capital, therefore, which can be employed in the
grocery trade cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that quantity.
If this capital is divided between two different grocers, their competition
will tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in the hands
of one only; and if it were divided among twenty, their competition would
be just so much the greater, and the chance of their combining together, G.ed.p362
in order to raise the price, just so much the less. Their competition might
perhaps ruin some of themselves; but to take care of this is the business
of the parties concerned, and it may safely be trusted to their discretion.
It can never hurt either the consumer or the producer; on the contrary, it
must tend to make the retailers both sell cheaper and buy dearer than if
the whole trade was monopolized by one or two persons. Some of them,
perhaps, may sometimes decoy a weak customer to buy what he has no
occasion for. This evil, however, is of too little importance to deserve the
publicattention,norwoulditnecessarilybepreventedbyrestrictingtheir
numbers. Itisnotthemultitudeofale-houses,togivethemostsuspicious

825 [8] Thepersonswhosecapitalsareemployedinanyofthosefourwaysare
themselves productive labourers. Their labour, when properly directed,
fixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon which
it is bestowed, and generally adds to its price the value at least of their
ownmaintenanceandconsumption. Theprofitsofthefarmer,oftheman-
ufacturer,ofthemerchant,andretailer,arealldrawnfromthepriceofthe
goods which the two first produce, and the two last buy and sell. Equal
capitals, however, employed in each of those four different ways, will im-
mediately put into motion very different quantities of productive labour,
and augment, too, in very different proportions the value of the annual
produceofthelandandlabourofthesocietytowhichtheybelong.
826 [9] Thecapitaloftheretailerreplaces,togetherwithitsprofits,thatofthe
merchant of whom he purchases goods, and thereby enables him to con-
tinue his business. The retailer himself is the only productive labourer
whom it immediately employs. In his profits consists the whole value
which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labour
ofthesociety.
827 [10] The capital of the wholesale merchant replaces, together with their
profits, the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he pur-
chasestherudeandmanufacturedproducewhichhedealsin,andthereby
enables them to continue their respective trades. It is by this service
chiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive labour of G.ed.p363
the society, and to increase the value of its annual produce. His capital
employs, too, the sailors and carriers who transport his goods from one
place to another, and it augments the price of those goods by the value,
notonlyofhisprofits,butoftheirwages. Thisisalltheproductivelabour

828 [11] Part of the capital of the master manufacturer is employed as a fixed
capital in the instruments of his trade, and replaces, together with its
profits, that of some other artificer of whom he purchases them. Part of
his circulating capital is employed in purchasing materials, and replaces,
withtheirprofits, thecapitalsofthefarmersandminersofwhomhepur-
chases them. But a great part of it is always, either annually, or in a
much shorter period, distributed among the different workmen whom he
employs. It augments the value of those materials by their wages, and by
theirmatters’profitsuponthewholestockofwages,materials,andinstru-
mentsoftradeemployedinthebusiness. Itputsimmediatelyintomotion,
therefore, amuch greater quantity of productive labour, and adds amuch
greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the society
thananequalcapitalinthehandsofanywholesalemerchant.
829 [12] No equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive la-
bour than that of the farmer. Not only his labouring servants, but his
labouring cattle, are productive labourers. In agriculture, too, nature la-
283 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

labourersandlabouringcattle,therefore,employedinagriculture,notonly
occasion, like the workmen in manufactures, the reproduction of a value
equal to their own consumption, or to the capital which employs them, G.ed.p364
together with its owners’ profits; but of a much greater value. Over and
above the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they regularly occasion

ofthewholeproduce. Noequalquantityofproductivelabouremployedin
manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction. In them nature
doesnothing;mandoesall;andthereproductionmustalwaysbeinpropor-
tion to the strength of the agents that occasion it. The capital employed
in agriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity of
productive labour than any equal capital employed in manufactures, but
inproportion,too,tothequantityofproductivelabourwhichitemploys,it
addsamuchgreatervaluetotheannualproduceofthelandandlabourof
the country, to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the
waysinwhichacapitalcanbeemployed,itisbyfarthemostadvantageous

830 [13] Thecapitalsemployedintheagricultureandintheretailtradeofany
society must always reside within that society. Their employment is con-
fined almost to a precise spot, to the farm and to the shop of the retailer.
Theymustgenerally,too,thoughtherearesomeexceptionstothis,belong

831 [14] Thecapitalofawholesalemerchant,onthecontrary,seemstohaveno
fixed or necessary residence anywhere, but may wander about from place

832 [15] The capital of the manufacturer must no doubt reside where the man-
ufacture is carried on; but where this shall be is not always necessarily
determined. It may frequently be at a great distance both from the place
wherethematerialsgrow,andfromthatwherethecompletemanufacture
is consumed. Lyons is very distant both from the places which afford the
284 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
materials of its manufactures, and from those which consume them. The

833 [16] Whether the merchant whose capital exports the surplus produce of
any society be a native or a foreigner is of very little importance. If he
isaforeigner, thenumberoftheirproductivelabourersisnecessarilyless
than if he had been a native by one man only, and the value of their an-
nualproducebytheprofitsofthatoneman. Thesailorsorcarrierswhom
he employs may still belong indifferently either to his country or to their
country, or to some third country, in the same manner as if he had been
a native. The capital of a foreigner gives a value to their surplus produce
equallywiththatofanativebyexchangingitforsomethingforwhichthere
is a demand at home. It as effectually replaces the capital of the person
whoproducesthatsurplus, andaseffectuallyenableshimtocontinuehis
business; theservicebywhichthecapitalofawholesalemerchantchiefly
contributes to support the productive labour, and to augment the value of
theannualproduceofthesocietytowhichhebelongs.
834 [17] It is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer should
residewithinthecountry. Itnecessarilyputsintomotionagreaterquant-
ityofproductivelabour,andaddsagreatervaluetotheannualproduceof
the land and labour of the society. It may, however, be very useful to the
country, though it should not reside within it. The capitals of the British
manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually imported from
the coasts of the Baltic are surely very useful to the countries which pro-
duce them. Those materials are a part of the surplus produce of those
countrieswhich,unlessitwasannuallyexchangedforsomethingwhichis
in demand there, would be of no value, and would soon cease to be pro-
duced. Themerchantswhoexportitreplacethecapitalsofthepeoplewho
produce it, and thereby encourage them to continue the production; and
theBritishmanufacturersreplacethecapitalsofthosemerchants.
835 [18] A particular country, in the same manner as a particular person, may
frequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate all its
lands, to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for immedi-
ate use and consumption, and to transport the surplus part either of the
rude or manufactured produce to those distant markets where it can be
exchangedforsomethingforwhichthereisademandathome. Theinhab-
itants of many different parts of Great Britain have not capital sufficient
toimproveandcultivatealltheirlands. Thewoolofthesoutherncounties
of Scotland is, a great part of it, after a long land carriage through very
bad roads, manufactured in Yorkshire, for want of capital to manufacture
it at home. There are many little manufacturing towns in Great Britain, G.ed.p366
of which the inhabitants have not capital sufficient to transport the pro-
duceoftheirownindustrytothosedistantmarketswherethereisdemand
285 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

properlyonlytheagentsofwealthiermerchantswhoresideinsomeofthe

greaterwillbethequantityofproductivelabourwhichitputsintomotion
within the country; as will likewise be the value which its employment
adds to the annual produce of the land and labour of the society. After
agriculture, the capital employed in manufactures puts into motion the
greatest quantity of productive labour, and adds the greatest value to the
annual produce. That which is employed in the trade of exportation has
theleasteffectofanyofthethree.
837 [20] Thecountry,indeed,whichhasnotcapitalsufficientforallthosethree
purposes has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems
naturally destined. To attempt, however, prematurely and with an insuf-
ficient capital to do all the three is certainly not the shortest way for a
society, no more than it would be for an individual, to acquire a sufficient
one. Thecapitalofalltheindividualsofanationhasitslimitsinthesame
mannerasthatofasingleindividual,andiscapableofexecutingonlycer-
tain purposes. The capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased
in the same manner as that of a single individual by their continually ac-
cumulating and adding to it whatever they save out of their revenue. It
is likely to increase the fastest, therefore, when it is employed in the way
that affords the greatest revenue to all the inhabitants of the country, as
theywillthusbeenabledtomakethegreatestsavings. Buttherevenueof
alltheinhabitantsofthecountryisnecessarilyinproportiontothevalue
oftheannualproduceoftheirlandandlabour.
838 [21] It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American
colonies towards wealth and greatness that almost their whole capitals
have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures,
thosehouseholdandcoursermanufacturesexceptedwhichnecessarilyac-
company the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the wo-
men and children in every private family. The greater part both of the
exportation and coasting trade of America is carried on by the capitals
of merchants who reside in Great Britain. Even the stores and ware- G.ed.p367
houses from which goods are retailed in some provinces, particularly in
Virginia and Maryland, belong many of them to merchants who reside in
themothercountry, andaffordoneofthefewinstancesoftheretailtrade
of a society being carried on by the capitals of those who are not resident
membersofit. WeretheAmericans,eitherbycombinationorbyanyother
sort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and,
bythusgivingamonopolytosuchoftheirowncountrymenascouldman-
ufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital into
thisemployment,theywouldretardinsteadofacceleratingthefurtherin-
crease in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct instead
286 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of promoting the progress of their country towards real wealth and great-
ness. This would be still more the case were they to attempt, in the same
manner,tomonopolizetothemselvestheirwholeexportationtrade.
839 [22] Thecourseofhumanprosperity,indeed,seemsscarceevertohavebeen
of so long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital
sufficient for all those three purposes; unless perhaps, we give credit to
the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of China, of those of
ancientEgypt,andoftheancientstateofIndostan. Eventhosethreecoun-
tries,thewealthiest,accordingtoallaccounts,thateverwereintheworld,
arechieflyrenownedfortheirsuperiorityinagricultureandmanufactures.
They do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade. The ancient
Egyptians had a superstitious antipathy to the sea; a superstition nearly
ofthesamekindprevailsamongtheIndians;andtheChinesehavenever
excelled in foreign commerce. The greater part of the surplus produce of
allthosethreecountriesseemstohavebeenalwaysexportedbyforeigners,
whogaveinexchangeforitsomethingelseforwhichtheyfoundademand

840 [23] It is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion
a greater or smaller quantity of productive labour, and add a greater or
smallervaluetotheannualproduceofitslandandlabour,accordingtothe G.ed.p368
differentproportionsinwhichitisemployedinagriculture,manufactures,
and wholesale trade. The difference, too, is very great, according to the
differentsortsofwholesaletradeinwhichanypartofitisemployed.
841 [24] Allwholesaletrade,allbuyinginordertosellagainbywholesale,may
be reduced to three different sorts. The home trade, the foreign trade of
consumption,andthecarryingtrade. Thehometradeisemployedinpur-
chasinginonepartofthesamecountry,andsellinginanother,theproduce
of the industry of that country. It comprehends both the inland and the
coasting trade. The foreign trade of consumption is employed in purchas-
ingforeigngoodsforhomeconsumption. Thecarryingtradeisemployedin
transacting the commerce of foreign countries, or in carrying the surplus
produceofonetoanother.
842 [25] The capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the coun-
try in order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country,
generally replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals that had
both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country,
and thereby enables them to continue that employment. When it sends
out from the residence of the merchant a certain value of commodities,
it generally brings back in return at least an equal value of other com-
modities. When both are the produce of domestic industry, it necessarily
replacesbyeverysuchoperationtwodistinctcapitalswhichhadbothbeen
employed in supporting productive labour, and thereby enables them to
continue that support. The capital which sends Scotch manufactures to
London, and brings back English corn and manufactures to Edinburgh,
necessarily replaces by every such operation, two British capitals which
287 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Bri-
tain.
843 [26] The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consump-
tion, when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry,
replacestoo,byeverysuchoperation,twodistinctcapitals;butoneofthem
onlyisemployedinsupportingdomesticindustry. Thecapitalwhichsends
BritishgoodstoPortugal,andbringsbackPortuguesegoodstoGreatBri-
tain, replaces by every such operation only one British capital. The other
is a Portuguese one. Though the returns, therefore, of the foreign trade
of consumption should be as quick as those of the home trade, the capital
employedinitwillgivebutonehalftheencouragementtotheindustryor
productivelabourofthecountry.
844 [27] Butthereturnsoftheforeigntradeofconsumptionareveryseldomso
quickasthoseofthehometrade. Thereturnsofthehometradegenerally
come in before the end of the year, and sometimes three or four times in
the year. The returns of the foreign trade of consumption seldom come
in before the end of the year, and sometimes not till after two or three
years. A capital, therefore, employed in the home trade will sometimes G.ed.p369
maketwelveoperations,orbesentoutandreturnedtwelvetimes,beforea
capitalemployedintheforeigntradeofconsumptionhasmadeone. Ifthe
capitalsareequal,therefore,theonewillgivefour-and-twentytimesmore
encouragementandsupporttotheindustryofthecountrythantheother.
845 [28] Theforeigngoodsforhomeconsumptionmaysometimesbepurchased,
not with the produce of domestic industry, but with some other foreign
goods. These last, however, must have been purchased either immedi-
ately with the produce of domestic industry, or with something else that
had been purchased with it; for, the case of war and conquest excepted,
foreign goods can ever be acquired but in exchange for something that
had been produced at home, either immediately, or after two or more dif-
ferent exchanges. The effects, therefore, of a capital employed in such a
roundabout foreign trade of consumption, are, in every respect, the same
asthoseofoneemployedinthemostdirecttradeofthesamekind,except
that the final returns are likely to be still more distant, as they must de-
pend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign trades. If the flax
and hemp of Riga are purchased with the tobacco of Virginia, which had
been purchased with British manufactures, the merchant must wait for
the returns of two distinct foreign trades before he can employ the same
capitalinre-purchasingalikequantityofBritishmanufactures. Iftheto-
baccoofVirginiahadbeenpurchased, notwithBritishmanufactures, but

thetradewillbejustasslowasever. Whetherthewholecapitalemployed
in such a round-about trade belong to one merchant or to three can make
nodifferencewithregardtothecountry,thoughitmaywithregardtothe
particular merchants. Three times a greater capital must in both cases
beemployedinordertoexchangeacertainvalueofBritishmanufactures
for a certain quantity of flax and hemp than would have been necessary
had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly exchanged for G.ed.p370
oneanother. Thewholecapitalemployed,therefore,insucharound-about
foreign trade of consumption will generally give less encouragement and
support to the productive labour of the country than an equal capital em-
ployedinamoredirecttradeofthesamekind.
846 [29] Whatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for
home consumption are purchased, it can occasion no essential difference
either in the nature of the trade, or in the encouragement and support
which it can give to the productive labour of the country from which it is
carried on. If they are purchased with the gold of Brazil, for example, or
with the silver of Peru, this gold and silver, like the tobacco of Virginia,
must have been purchased with something that either was the produce
oftheindustryofthecountry,orthathadbeenpurchasedwithsomething
elsethatwasso. Sofar,therefore,astheproductivelabourofthecountryis
concerned,theforeigntradeofconsumptionwhichiscarriedonbymeans
ofgoldandsilverhasalltheadvantagesandalltheinconveniencesofany
other equally round-about foreign trade of consumption, and will replace
just as fast or just as slow the capital which is immediately employed in
supporting that productive labour. It seems even to have one advantage
over any other equally roundabout foreign trade. The transportation of
thosemetalsfromoneplacetoanother,onaccountoftheirsmallbulkand
great value, is less expensive than that of almost any other foreign goods
ofequalvalue. Theirfreightismuchless,andtheirinsurancenotgreater;
and no goods, besides, are less liable to suffer by the carriage. An equal
quantity of foreign goods, therefore, may frequently be purchased with a
smaller quantity of the produce of domestic industry, by the intervention
ofgoldandsilver, thanbythatofanyotherforeigngoods. Thedemandof
the country may frequently, in this manner, be supplied more completely
and at a smaller expense than in any other. Whether, by the continual
exportationofthosemetals,atradeofthiskindislikelytoimpoverishthe
countryfromwhichitiscarriedon,inanyotherway,Ishallhaveoccasion
toexamineatgreatlengthhereafter.
847 [30] Thatpartofthecapitalofanycountrywhichisemployedinthecarry-
ingtradeisaltogetherwithdrawnfromsupportingtheproductivelabourof
thatparticularcountry,tosupportthatofsomeforeigncountries. Though
itmayreplacebyeveryoperationtwodistinctcapitals,yetneitherofthem
belongs to that particular country. The capital of the Dutch merchant, G.ed.p371
which carries the corn of Poland to Portugal, and brings back the fruits
289 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
andwinesofPortugaltoPoland,replacesbyeverysuchoperationtwocap-
itals, neither of which had been employed in supporting the productive
labour of Holland; but one of them in supporting that of Poland, and the
other that of Portugal. The profits only return regularly to Holland, and
constitute the whole addition which this trade necessarily makes to the
annual produce of the land and labour of that country. When, indeed, the
carrying trade of any particular country is carried on with the ships and
sailors of that country, that part of the capital employed in it which pays
thefreightisdistributedamong,andputsintomotion,acertainnumberof
productivelabourersofthatcountry. Almostallnationsthathavehadany
considerableshare ofthe carrying tradehave, infact, carried iton inthis
manner. Thetradeitselfhasprobablyderiveditsnamefromit,thepeople
ofsuchcountriesbeingthecarrierstoothercountries. Itdoesnot,however,
seemessentialtothenatureofthetradethatitshouldbeso. ADutchmer-
chantmay,forexample,employhiscapitalintransactingthecommerceof

the other, not in Dutch, but in British bottoms. It may be presumed that
heactuallydoessouponsomeparticularoccasions. Itisuponthisaccount,
however,thatthecarryingtradehasbeensupposedpeculiarlyadvantage-
ous to such a country as Great Britain, of which the defence and security
dependuponthenumberofitssailorsandshipping. Butthesamecapital
may employ as many sailors and shipping, either in the foreign trade of

sels,asitcouldinthecarryingtrade. Thenumberofsailorsandshipping

Toforce,therefore,byextraordinaryencouragements,alargershareofthe
capital of any country into the carrying trade than what would naturally
gotoitwillnotalwaysnecessarilyincreasetheshippingofthatcountry.
848 [31] The capital, therefore, employed in the home trade of any country will
generally give encouragement and support to a greater quantity of pro-
ductivelabourinthatcountry,andincreasethevalueofitsannualproduce
morethananequalcapitalemployedintheforeigntradeofconsumption:
and the capital employed in this latter trade has in both these respects G.ed.p372
a still greater advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying
trade. The riches, and so far as power depends upon riches, the power of
everycountrymustalwaysbeinproportiontothevalueofitsannualpro-
duce,thefundfromwhichalltaxesmustultimatelybepaid. Butthegreat
objectofthepoliticaleconomyofeverycountryistoincreasetherichesand

ior encouragement to the foreign trade of consumption above the home
290 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
trade, nor to the carrying trade above either of the other two. It ought
neither to force nor to allure into either of those two channels a greater
share of the capital of the country than what would naturally flow into
themofitsownaccord.
849 [32] Each of those different branches of trade, however, is not only advant-
ageous,butnecessaryandunavoidable,whenthecourseofthings,without
anyconstraintorviolence,naturallyintroducesit.
850 [33] When the produce of any particular branch of industry exceeds what
the demand of the country requires, the surplus must be sent abroad and
exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. Without
suchexportationapartoftheproductivelabourofthecountrymustcease,
andthevalueofitsannualproducediminish. ThelandandlabourofGreat
Britainproducegenerallymorecorn,woollens,andhardwarethanthede-
mand of the home market requires. The surplus part of them, therefore,
must be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a
demand at home. It is only by means of such exportation that this sur-
plus can acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labour and expense
of producing it. The neighbourhood of the sea-coast, and the banks of all
navigable rivers, are advantageous situations for industry, only because
they facilitate the exportation and exchange of such surplus produce for
somethingelsewhichismoreindemandthere.
851 [34] Whentheforeigngoodswhicharethuspurchasedwiththesurpluspro-
duce of domestic industry exceed the demand of the home market, the
surplus part of them must be sent abroad again and exchanged for some-
thing more in demand at home. About ninety-six thousand hogsheads of
tobacco are annually purchased in Virginia and Maryland with a part of
the surplus produce of British industry. But the demand of Great Britain G.ed.p373
doesnotrequire,perhaps,morethanfourteenthousand. Iftheremaining
eighty-two thousand, therefore, could not be sent abroad and exchanged
for something more in demand at home, the importation of them must
cease immediately, and with it the productive labour of all those inhabit-
antsofGreatBritain,whoareatpresentemployedinpreparingthegoods

Thosegoods,whicharepartoftheproduceofthelandandlabourofGreat

tradeofconsumption,thereforemay,uponsomeoccasions,beasnecessary
for supporting the productive labour of the country, and the value of its

852 [35] Whenthecapitalstockofanycountryisincreasedtosuchadegreethat

andsymptomofgreatnationalwealth; butitdoesnotseemtobethenat-
291 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
uralcauseofit. Thosestatesmenwhohavebeendisposedtofavouritwith
particular encouragements seem to have mistaken the effect and symp-
tom for the cause. Holland, in proportion to the extent of the land and
the number of its inhabitants, by far the richest country in Europe, has,
accordingly, the greatest share of the carrying trade of Europe. England,
perhapsthesecondrichestcountryofEurope,islikewisesupposedtohave
a considerable share of it; though what commonly passes for the carrying
trade of England will frequently, perhaps, be found to be no more than a
round-about foreign trade of consumption. Such are, in a great measure,
thetradeswhichcarrythegoodsoftheEastandWestIndies,andofAmer-
ica, to different European markets. Those goods are generally purchased
eitherimmediatelywiththeproduceofBritishindustry,orwithsomething
elsewhichhadbeenpurchasedwiththatproduce,andthefinalreturnsof
those trades are generally used or consumed in Great Britain. The trade
which is carried on in British bottoms between the different ports of the
Mediterranean,andsometradeofthesamekindcarriedonbyBritishmer- G.ed.p374
chants between the different ports of India, make, perhaps, the principal
branchesofwhatisproperlythecarryingtradeofGreatBritain.
853 [36] Theextentofthehometradeandofthecapitalwhichcanbeemployed

plusproduceofallthedifferentcountriesintheworld. Itspossibleextent,
therefore, is in a manner infinite in comparison of that of the other two,
andiscapableofabsorbingthegreatestcapitals.
854 [37] The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which
determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture,
in manufactures, or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail
trade. Thedifferentquantitiesofproductivelabourwhichitmayputinto
motion, and the different values which it may add to the annual, produce
of the land and labour of the society, according as it is employed in one
or other of those different ways, never enter into his thoughts. In coun-
tries, therefore, where agriculture is the most profitable of all employ-
ments, and farming and improving the most direct roads to a splendid
fortune,thecapitalsofindividualswillnaturallybeemployedintheman-
ner most advantageous to the whole society. The profits of agriculture,
however, seem to have no superiority over those of other employments in
any part of Europe. Projectors, indeed, in every corner of it, have within
these few years amused the public with most magnificent accounts of the
profits to be made by the cultivation and improvement of land. Without
enteringintoanyparticulardiscussionoftheircalculations,averysimple
observation may satisfy us that the result of them must be false. We see

capital,sometimesfromnocapital. Asingleinstanceofsuchafortuneac-
quired by agriculture in the same time, and from such a capital, has not,
perhaps, occurred in Europe during the course of the present century. In
all the great countries of Europe, however, much good land still remains
uncultivated, and the greater part of what is cultivated is far from being
improved to the degree of which it is capable. Agriculture, therefore, is
almost everywhere capable of absorbing a much greater capital than has
ever yet been employed in it. What circumstances in the policy of Europe

Of the different Progress of Opulence
in different Nations CHAPTER I
OF THE NATURAL PROGRESS OF
OPULENCE
855 [1] THE great commerce of every civilised society is that carried on between
the inhabitants of the town and those of the country. It consists in the
exchangeofrudeformanufacturedproduce,eitherimmediately,orbythe
intervention of money, or of some sort of paper which represents money.
Thecountrysuppliesthetownwiththemeansofsubsistenceandthema-
terials of manufacture. The town repays this supply by sending back a
part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country. The
town,inwhichthereneitherisnorcanbeanyreproductionofsubstances,
may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from
the country. We must not, however, upon this account, imagine that the
gain of the town is the loss of the country. The gains of both are mutual
and reciprocal, and the division of labour is in this, as in all other cases,
advantageoustoallthedifferentpersonsemployedinthevariousoccupa-
tionsintowhichitissubdivided. Theinhabitantsofthecountrypurchase
of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods, with the produce
of a much smaller quantity of their own labour, than they must have em-
ployedhadtheyattemptedtopreparethemthemselves. Thetownaffords
amarketforthesurplusproduceofthecountry,orwhatisoverandabove
the maintenance of the cultivators, and it is there that the inhabitants
of the country exchange it for something else which is in demand among
them. Thegreaterthenumberandrevenueoftheinhabitantsofthetown,
the more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the country;
and the more extensive that market, it is always the more advantageous
to a great number. The corn which grows within a mile of the town sells
there for the same price with that which comes from twenty miles dis-
tance. Butthepriceofthelattermustgenerallynotonlypaytheexpense G.ed.p377
of raising and bringing it to market, but afford, too, the ordinary profits
of agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and cultivators of the coun-
try,therefore,whichliesintheneighbourhoodofthetown,overandabove
theordinaryprofitsofagriculture,gain,inthepriceofwhattheysell,the
whole value of the carriage of the like produce that is brought from more
distant parts, and they have, besides, the whole value of this carriage in
the price of what they buy. Compare the cultivation of the lands in the TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
neighbourhood of any considerable town with that of those which lie at
some distance from it, and you will easily satisfy yourself how much the
country is benefited by the commerce of the town. Among all the absurd
speculations that have been propagated concerning the balance of trade,

and luxury. It is the surplus produce of the country only, or what is over

this surplus produce. The town, indeed, may not always derive its whole
subsistencefromthecountryinitsneighbourhood,orevenfromtheterrit-
ory to which it belongs, but from very distant countries; and this, though
it forms no exception from the general rule, has occasioned considerable
variationsintheprogressofopulenceindifferentagesandnations.
857 [3] Thatorderofthingswhichnecessityimposesingeneral,thoughnotin
every particular country, is, in every particular country, promoted by the
natural inclinations of man. If human institutions had never thwarted
those natural inclinations, the towns could nowhere have increased bey-
ond what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they
were situated could support; till such time, at least, as the whole of that
territory was completely cultivated and improved. Upon equal, or nearly
equal profits, most men will choose to employ their capitals rather in the
improvement and cultivation of land than either in manufactures or in
foreigntrade. Themanwhoemployshiscapitalinlandhasitmoreunder

that of the farmer, necessarily tied down to a precise spot, they naturally

withmanyotherartificersandretailers,necessaryorusefulforsupplying
their occasional wants, and who contribute still further to augment the
town. The inhabitants of the town and those of the country are mutually
the servants of one another. The town is a continual fair or market, to

itantsofthetownbothwiththematerialsoftheirwork,andthemeansof

sistence, therefore, canaugmentbutinproportiontotheaugmentationof
thedemandfromthecountryforfinishedwork;andthisdemandcanaug-
ment only in proportion to the extension of improvement and cultivation.
Had human institutions, therefore, never disturbed the natural course of
things, the progressive wealth and increase of the towns would, in every
political society, be consequential, and in proportion to the improvement
andcultivationoftheterritoryorcountry.

297 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
861 [7] In seeking for employment to a capital, manufactures are, upon equal
or nearly equal profits, naturally preferred to foreign commerce, for the
same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures. As
thecapitalofthelandlordorfarmerismoresecurethanthatofthemanu-
facturer,sothecapitalofthemanufacturer,beingatalltimesmorewithin
his view and command, is more secure than that of the foreign merchant.
In every period, indeed, of every society, the surplus part both of the rude
andmanufacturedproduce,orthatforwhichthereisnodemandathome,
must be sent abroad in order to be exchanged for something for which
there is some demand at home. But whether the capital, which carries

AmericanandWestIndiancolonieswouldhavebeenmuchlessrapidhad
no capital but what belonged to themselves been employed in exporting
theirsurplusproduce.
862 [8] Accordingtothenaturalcourseofthings,therefore,thegreaterpartof
the capital of every growing society is, first, directed to agriculture, after-
wards to manufactures, and last of all to foreign commerce. This order of
thingsissoverynaturalthatineverysocietythathadanyterritoryithas

and some sort of coarse industry of the manufacturing kind must have

themselvesinforeigncommerce.

298 CHAPTER II
G.ed.p381
OF THE DISCOURAGEMENT OF
AGRICULTURE IN THE ANCIENT STATE OF
EUROPE AFTER THE FALL OF THE
ROMAN EMPIRE
864 [1] WHEN the German and Scythian nations overran the western provinces
of the Roman empire, the confusions which followed so great a revolution
lasted for several centuries. The rapine and violence which the barbari-
ans exercised against the ancient inhabitants interrupted the commerce
between the towns and the country. The towns were deserted, and the
countrywasleftuncultivated,andthewesternprovincesofEurope,which
had enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, G.ed.p382
sunk into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the continu-
ance of those confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of those nations
acquired or usurped to themselves the greater part of the lands of those
countries. A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of them,
whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of
themwereengrossed,andthegreaterpartbyafewgreatproprietors.
865 [2] This original engrossing of uncultivated lands, though a great, might
havebeenbutatransitoryevil. Theymightsoonhavebeendividedagain,
and broke into small parcels either by succession or by alienation. The
lawofprimogeniturehinderedthemfrombeingdividedbysuccession: the
introduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels by
alienation.
866 [3] When land, like movables, is considered as the means only of subsist-
ence and enjoyment, the natural law of succession divides it, like them,
among all the children of the family; of an of whom the subsistence and
enjoymentmaybesupposedequallydeartothefather. Thisnaturallawof
succession accordingly took place among the Romans, who made no more
distinction between elder and younger, between male and female, in the
inheritanceoflandsthanwedointhedistributionofmovables. Butwhen G.ed.p383
landwasconsideredasthemeans,notofsubsistencemerely,butofpower
and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to
one. In those disorderly times every great landlord was a sort of petty
prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
respects their legislator in peace, and their leader in war. He made war
according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and
sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, there-
fore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it,
depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose
every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its
neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not
immediately, indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed
estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of
monarchies, though not always at their first institution. That the power,
and consequently the security of the monarchy, may not be weakened by
division, it must descend entire to one of the children. To which of them

eral rule, founded not upon the doubtful distinctions of personal merit,
butuponsomeplainandevidentdifferencewhichcanadmitofnodispute.

to the female; and when all other things are equal, the elder everywhere
takesplaceoftheyounger. Hencetheoriginoftherightofprimogeniture,
andofwhatiscalledlinealsuccession.
867 [4] Laws frequently continue in force long after the circumstances which
firstgaveoccasiontothem,andwhichcouldalonerenderthemreasonable,
are no more. In the present state of Europe, the proprietor of a single
acre of land is as perfectly secure of his possession as the proprietor of a G.ed.p384
hundredthousand. Therightofprimogeniture,however,stillcontinuesto
berespected, andasofallinstitutionsitisthefittesttosupportthepride
of family distinctions, it is still likely to endure for many centuries. In
everyotherrespect, nothingcanbemorecontrarytotherealinterestofa
numerousfamilythanarightwhich,inordertoenrichone,beggarsallthe

868 [5] Entailsarethenaturalconsequencesofthelawofprimogeniture. They
were introduced to preserve a certain lineal succession, of which the law
ofprimogeniturefirstgavetheidea,andtohinderanypartoftheoriginal
estatefrombeingcarriedoutoftheproposedlineeitherbygift, ordevise,
oralienation;eitherbythefolly,orbythemisfortuneofanyofitssuccess-
ive owners. They were altogether unknown to the Romans. Neither their
substitutions nor fideicommisses bear any resemblance to entails, though
someFrenchlawyershavethoughtpropertodressthemoderninstitution
inthelanguageandgarbofthoseancientones.
869 [6] When great landed estates were a sort of principalities, entails might
not be unreasonable. Like what are called the fundamental laws of some
monarchies, they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from
being endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man. But in the
present state of Europe, when small as well as great estates derive their
security from the laws of their country, nothing can be more completely
300 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
absurd. They are founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions, the
supposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal
righttotheearth,andtoallthatitpossesses;butthatthepropertyofthe
present generation should be restrained and regulated according to the
fancyofthosewhodiedperhapsfivehundredyearsago. Entails,however,
are still respected through the greater part of Europe, in those countries
particularly in which noble birth is a necessary qualification for the en-
joyment either of civil or military honours. Entails are thought necessary
for maintaining this exclusive privilege of the nobility to the great offices G.ed.p385
and honours of their country; and that order having usurped one unjust
advantage over the rest of their fellow citizens, lest their poverty should
render it ridiculous, it is thought reasonable that they should have an-
other. The common law of England, indeed, is said to abhor perpetuities,
andtheyareaccordinglymorerestrictedtherethaninanyotherEuropean
monarchy; though even England is not altogether without them. In Scot-
land more than one-fifth, perhaps more than one-third, part of the whole
landsofthecountryareatpresentsupposedtobeunderstrictentail.
870 [7] Great tracts of uncultivated land were, in this manner, not only en-
grossed by particular families, but the possibility of their being divided
againwasasmuchaspossibleprecludedforever. Itseldomhappens,how-
ever, that a great proprietor is a great improver. In the disorderly times
whichgavebirthtothosebarbarousinstitutions,thegreatproprietorwas
sufficiently employed in defending his own territories, or in extending his
jurisdictionandauthorityoverthoseofhisneighbours. Hehadnoleisure
to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land. When the estab-
lishment of law and order afforded him this leisure, he often wanted the
inclination,andalmostalwaystherequisiteabilities. Iftheexpenseofhis
house and person either equalled or exceeded his revenue, as it did very
frequently,hehadnostocktoemployinthismanner. Ifhewasaneconom-
ist, he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual savings in
newpurchasesthanintheimprovementofhisoldestate. Toimproveland
with profit, like all other commercial projects, requires an exact attention
to small savings and small gains, of which a man born to a great fortune,
even though naturally frugal, is very seldom capable. The situation of
such a person naturally disposes him to attend rather to ornament which
pleaseshis fancythan toprofit for which he hasso little occasion. Theel-
eganceofhisdress,ofhisequipage,ofhishouse,andhouseholdfurniture,
are objects which from his infancy he has been accustomed to have some G.ed.p386
anxiety about. The turn of mind which this habit naturally forms follows
him when he comes to think of the improvement of land. He embellishes
perhaps four or five hundred acres in the neighbourhood of his house, at
tentimestheexpensewhichthelandisworthafterallhisimprovements;
and finds that if he was to improve his whole estate in the same manner,
and he has little taste for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he
had finished the tenth part of it. There still remain in both parts of the
301 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
United Kingdom some great estates which have continued without inter-
ruptioninthehandsofthesamefamilysincethetimesoffeudalanarchy.
Comparethepresentconditionofthoseestateswiththepossessionsofthe

argumenttoconvinceyouhowunfavourablesuchextensivepropertyisto

871 [8] If little improvement was to be expected from such great proprietors,
stilllesswastobehopedforfromthosewhooccupiedthelandunderthem.
In the ancient state of Europe, the occupiers of land were all tenants at
will. They were all or almost all slaves; but their slavery was of a milder
kind than that known among the ancient Greeks and Romans, or even
in our West Indian colonies. They were supposed to belong more directly
to the land than to their master. They could, therefore, be sold with it,
but not separately. They could marry, provided it was with the consent of
theirmaster;andhecouldnotafterwardsdissolvethemarriagebyselling
the man and wife to different persons. If he maimed or murdered any of
them, he was liable to some penalty, though generally but to a small one.
They were not, however, capable of acquiring property. Whatever they
acquired was acquired to their master, and he could take it from them
at pleasure. Whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on G.ed.p387
by means of such slaves was properly carried on by their master. It was
at his expense. The seed, the cattle, and the instruments of husbandry
were all his. It was for his benefit. Such slaves could acquire nothing but
theirdailymaintenance. Itwasproperlytheproprietorhimself,therefore,
that,inthiscase,occupiedhisownlands,andcultivatedthembyhisown
bondmen. ThisspeciesofslaverystillsubsistsinRussia,Poland,Hungary,

872 [9] Butifgreatimprovementsareseldomtobeexpectedfromgreatpropri-
etors,theyareleastofalltobeexpectedwhentheyemployslavesfortheir

thattheworkdonebyslaves,thoughitappearstocostonlytheirmainten-
ance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can acquire no prop-
erty,canhavenootherinterestbuttoeatasmuch,andtolabouraslittleas

own maintenance can be squeezed out of him by violence only, and not by G.ed.p388

degenerated, how unprofitable it became to the master when it fell under
the management of slaves, is remarked by both Pliny and Columella. In
thetimeofAristotleithadnotbeenmuchbetterinancientGreece. Speak-
ing of the ideal republic described in the laws of Plato, to maintain five

302 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
873 [10] The pride of man makes him love to domineer, and nothing mortifies
him so much as to be obliged to condescend to persuade his inferiors.
Whereverthelawallowsit,andthenatureoftheworkcanaffordit,there-
fore, he will generally prefer the service of slaves to that of freemen. The
planting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expense of slave-cultivation.
The raising of corn, it seems, in the present times, cannot. In the Eng-
lish colonies, of which the principal produce is corn, the far greater part
of the work is done by freemen. The late resolution of the Quakers in
Pennsylvania to set at liberty all their negro slaves may satisfy us that
theirnumbercannotbeverygreat. Hadtheymadeanyconsiderablepart

in any of our West Indian colonies are generally much greater than those
of any other cultivation that is known either in Europe or America; and
the profits of a tobacco plantation, though inferior to those of sugar, are
superior to those of corn, as has already been observed. Both can afford
the expense of slave-cultivation, but sugar can afford it still better than
tobacco. Thenumberofnegroesaccordinglyismuchgreater,inproportion
tothatofwhites,inoursugarthaninourtobaccocolonies.
874 [11] To the slave cultivators of ancient times gradually succeeded a species
of farmers known at present in France by the name of metayers. They
are called in Latin, Coloni Partiarii. They have been so long in disuse in
EnglandthatatpresentIknownoEnglishnameforthem. Theproprietor
furnished them with the seed, cattle, and instruments of husbandry, the

875 [12] Landoccupiedbysuchtenantsisproperlycultivatedattheexpenseof
the proprietor as much as that occupied by slaves. There is, however, one
veryessentialdifferencebetweenthem. Suchtenants, beingfreemen, are
capable of acquiring property, and having a certain proportion of the pro-
duceoftheland,theyhaveaplaininterestthatthewholeproduceshould
be as great as possible, in order that their own proportion may be so. A
slave,onthecontrary,whocanacquirenothingbuthismaintenance,con-
sults his own ease by making the land produce as little as possible over
and above that maintenance. It is probable that it was partly upon ac-
count of this advantage, and partly upon account of the encroachments
which the sovereign, always jealous of the great lords, gradually encour-
aged their villains to make upon their authority, and which seem at last
to have been such as rendered this species of servitude altogether incon-
venient, that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the greater
part of Europe. The time and manner, however, in which so important a
303 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
revolutionwasbroughtaboutisoneofthemostobscurepointsinmodern
history. The Church of Rome claims great merit in it; and it is certain G.ed.p390
thatsoearlyasthetwelfthcentury,AlexanderIIIpublishedabullforthe
general emancipation of slaves. It seems, however, to have been rather a
pious exhortation than a law to which exact obedience was required from
thefaithful. Slaverycontinuedtotakeplacealmostuniversallyforseveral
centuriesafterwards,tillitwasgraduallyabolishedbythejointoperation
of the two interests above mentioned, that of the proprietor on the one
hand, and that of the sovereign on the other. A villain enfranchised, and
at the same time allowed to continue in possession of the land, having no
stockofhisown,couldcultivateitonlybymeansofwhatthelandlordad-
vanced to him, and must, therefore, have been what the French called a
Metayer.
876 [13] It could never, however, be the interest even of this last species of cul-
tivatorstolayout,inthefurtherimprovementoftheland,anypartofthe
little stock which they might save from their own share of the produce,
because the lord, who laid out nothing, was to get one half of whatever it
produced. The tithe, which is but a tenth of the produce, is found to be a
very great hindrance to improvement. A tax, therefore, which amounted
to one half must have been an effectual bar to it. It might be the interest
ofametayertomakethelandproduceasmuchascouldbebroughtoutof

their capital in the further improvement of the farm; because they may
sometimes expect to recover it, with a large profit, before the expiration
of the lease. The possession even of such farmers, however, was long ex-
tremely precarious, and still is so in many parts of Europe. They could

Europe where the yeomanry has always been most respected, it was not
till about the 14th of Henry the VIIth that the action of ejectment was
invented, by which the tenant recovers, not damages only but possession,
and in which his claim is not necessarily concluded by the uncertain de-
cision of a single assize. This action has been found so effectual a remedy

and trusting that the honour of his landlord would take no advantage of
so important an improvement. Those laws and customs so favourable to
the yeomanry have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of
Englandthanalltheirboastedregulationsofcommercetakentogether.
878 [15] The law which secures the longest leases against successors of every
kind is, so far as I know, peculiar to Great Britain. It was introduced G.ed.p393
into Scotland so early as 1449, a law of James the IId. Its beneficial in-
fluence, however, has been much obstructed by entails; the heirs of entail
being generally restrained from letting leases for any long term of years,
frequentlyformorethanoneyear. AlateActofParliamenthas,inthisre-
spect,somewhatslackenedtheirfetters,thoughtheyarestillbymuchtoo
strait. In Scotland, besides, as no leasehold gives a vote for a Member of
Parliament, the yeomanry are upon this account less respectable to their
landlordsthaninEngland.
879 [16] In other parts of Europe, after it was found convenient to secure ten-
antsbothagainstheirsandpurchasers,thetermoftheirsecuritywasstill
limited to a very short period; in France, for example, to nine years from
thecommencementofthelease. Ithasinthatcountry,indeed,beenlately
extended to twenty-seven, a period still too short to encourage the tenant
to make the most important improvements. The proprietors of land were
ancientlythelegislatorsofeverypartofEurope. Thelawsrelatingtoland,
therefore, were all calculated for what they supposed the interest of the
proprietor. It was for his interest, they had imagined, that no lease gran-
ted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from enjoying, during a
long term of years, the full value of his land. Avarice and injustice are
always short-sighted, and they did not foresee how much this regulation
mustobstructimprovement, andtherebyhurtinthelong-runtherealin-
terestofthelandlord.
305 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
880 [17] The farmers too, besides paying the rent, were anciently, it was sup-
posed,boundtoperformagreatnumberofservicestothelandlord,which

beingalmostentirelyarbitrary,subjectedthetenanttomanyvexations. In
Scotland the abolition of all services not precisely stipulated in the lease
hasinthecourseofafewyearsverymuchalteredforthebetterthecondi-
tionoftheyeomanryofthatcountry.
881 [18] The public services to which the yeomanry were bound were not less
arbitrary than the private ones. To make and maintain the high roads, a
servitudewhichstillsubsists,Ibelieve,everywhere,thoughwithdifferent
degrees of oppression in different countries, was not the only one. When G.ed.p394

throughanypartofthecountry,theyeomanrywereboundtoprovidethem
withhorses,carriages,andprovisions,atapriceregulatedbythepurveyor.
GreatBritainis,Ibelieve,theonlymonarchyinEuropewheretheoppres-
sion of purveyance has been entirely abolished. It still subsists in France
andGermany.
882 [19] The public taxes to which they were subject were as irregular and op-
pressiveastheservices. Theancientlords,thoughextremelyunwillingto
grantthemselvesanypecuniaryaidtotheirsovereign,easilyallowedhim
to tallage, as they called it their tenants, and had not knowledge enough
to foresee how much this must in the end affect their own revenue. The
taille, as it still subsists in France, may serve as an example of those an-
cient tallages. It is a tax upon the supposed profits of the farmer, which
they estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm. It is his interest,
therefore, to appear to have as little as possible, and consequently to em-
ploy as little as possible in its cultivation, and none in its improvement.
Should any stock happen to accumulate in the hands of a French farmer,
the taille is almost equal to a prohibition of its ever being employed upon
the land. This tax, besides, is supposed to dishonour whoever is subject
to it, and to degrade him below, not only the rank of a gentleman, but
that of a burgher, and whoever rents the lands of another becomes sub-
jecttoit. Nogentleman,norevenanyburgherwhohasstock,willsubmit
to this degradation. This tax, therefore, not only hinders the stock which
accumulates upon the land from being employed in its improvement, but
drives away an other stock from it. The ancient tenths and fifteenths, so
usualinEnglandinformertimes,seem,sofarastheyaffectedtheland,to G.ed.p395
havebeentaxesofthesamenaturewiththetaille.
883 [20] Under all these discouragements, little improvement could be expec-
ted from the occupiers of land. That order of people, with all the liberty
and security which law can give, must always improve under great dis-
advantages. The farmer, compared with the proprietor, is as a merchant
who trades with borrowed money compared with one who trades with his
own. The stock of both may improve, but that of the one, with only equal
306 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
goodconduct,mustalwaysimprovemoreslowlythanthatoftheother,on
accountofthelargeshareoftheprofitswhichisconsumedbytheinterest
oftheloan. Thelandscultivatedbythefarmermust,inthesamemanner,
with only equal good conduct, be improved more slowly than those cultiv-
ated by the proprietor, on account of the large share of the produce which
is consumed in the rent, and which, had the farmer been proprietor, he

should quit the superior in order to place himself in an inferior station.
Even in the present state of Europe, therefore, little stock is likely to go
from any other profession to the improvement of land in the way of farm-
ing. MoredoesperhapsinGreatBritainthaninanyothercountry,though

have generally been acquired by farming, the trade, perhaps, in which of
all others stock is commonly acquired most slowly. After small propriet-
ors, however, rich and great farmers are, in every country, the principal
improvers. There are more such perhaps in England than in any other
European monarchy. In the republican governments of Holland and of
Berne in Switzerland, the farmers are said to be not inferior to those of
England.
884 [21] The ancient policy of Europe was, over and above all this, unfavour- G.ed.p396

OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF CITIES
AND TOWNS AFTER THE FALL OF THE
ROMAN EMPIRE
885 [1] THE inhabitantsofcitiesandtownswere, afterthefalloftheRomanem-
pire,notmorefavouredthanthoseofthecountry. Theyconsisted,indeed,
ofaverydifferentorderofpeoplefromthefirstinhabitantsoftheancient
republicsofGreeceandItaly. Theselastwerecomposedchieflyofthepro-
prietorsoflands,amongwhomthepublicterritorywasoriginallydivided,
and who found it convenient to build their houses in the neighbourhood
ofoneanother, andtosurroundthemwithawall, forthesakeofcommon
defence. After the fall of the Roman empire, on the contrary, the propri-
etors of land seem generally to have lived in fortified castles on their own
estates,andinthemidstoftheirowntenantsanddependants. Thetowns
were chiefly inhabited by tradesmen and mechanics, who seem in those
days to have been of servile, or very nearly of servile condition. The priv-
ilegeswhichwefindgrantedbyancientcharterstotheinhabitantsofsome
of the principal towns in Europe sufficiently show what they were before
those grants. The people to whom it is granted as a privilege that they
might give away their own daughters in marriage without the consent of
their lord, that upon their death their own children, and not their lord,
should succeed to their goods, and that they might dispose of their own
effects by will, must, before those grants, have been either altogether or
verynearlyinthesamestateofvillanagewiththeoccupiersoflandinthe
country.
886 [2] They seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people, who
used to travel about with their goods from place to place, and from fair
to fair, like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times. In all the dif-
ferent countries of Europe then, in the same manner as in several of the
Tartar governments of Asia at present, taxes used to be levied upon the
persons and goods of travellers when they passed through certain man-
ors, when they went over certain bridges, when they carried about their
goods from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or
stall to sell them in. These different taxes were known in England by
thenamesofpassage,pontage,lastage,andstallage. Sometimestheking, G.ed.p398 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
sometimes a great lord, who had, it seems, upon some occasions, author-
ity to do this, would grant to particular traders, to such particularly as
lived in their own demesnes, a general exemption from such taxes. Such
traders, though in other respects of servile, or very nearly of servile con-
dition, were upon this account called free-traders. They in return usually
paid to their protector a sort of annual poll-tax. In those days protection
wasseldomgrantedwithoutavaluableconsideration,andthistaxmight,
perhaps,beconsideredascompensationforwhattheirpatronsmightlose
by their exemption from other taxes. At first, both those poll-taxes and
those exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and to have af-
fectedonlyparticularindividualsduringeithertheirlivesorthepleasure
of their protectors. In the very imperfect accounts which have been pub-
lished from Domesday Book of several of the towns of England, mention
is frequently made sometimes of the tax which particular burghers paid,
eachofthem, eithertothekingortosomeothergreatlordforthissortof
protection;andsometimesofthegeneralamountonlyofallthosetaxes1.
887 [3] But how servile soever may have been originally the condition of the G.ed.p399
inhabitants of the towns, it appears evidently that they arrived at liberty
and independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the country.
That part of the king’s revenue which arose from such poll-taxes in any
particular town used commonly to be let in farm during a term of years
for a rent certain, sometimes to the sheriff of the county, and sometimes
tootherpersons. Theburghersthemselvesfrequentlygotcreditenoughto

chequer by the hands of their own bailiff, and being thus altogether freed
from the insolence of the king’s officers- a circumstance in those days re-
gardedasofthegreatestimportance.
888 [4] At first the farm of the town was probably let to the burghers, in the
same manner as it had been to other farmers, for a term of years only. In
process of time, however, it seems to have become the general practice to
grantittotheminfee,thatisforever,reservingarentcertainneverafter-
wards to be augmented. The payment having thus become perpetual, the
exemptions, in return for which it was made, naturally became perpetual
too. Those exemptions, therefore, ceased to be personal, and could not af-
terwards be considered as belonging to individuals as individuals, but as
burghersofaparticularburgh,which,uponthisaccount,wascalledafree

889 [5] Along with this grant, the important privileges above mentioned, that

bywill,weregenerallybestowedupontheburghersofthetowntowhomit

with the freedom of trade to particular burghers, as individuals, I know
not. I reckon it not improbable that they were, though I cannot produce
any direct evidence of it. But however this may have been, the principal

that is, as anciently understood, to guard and defend those walls against
allattacksandsurprisesbynightaswellasbyday. InEnglandtheywere
generally exempted from suit to the hundred and county courts; and all
such pleas as should arise among them, the pleas of the crown excepted,
werelefttothedecisionoftheirownmagistrates. Inothercountriesmuch
greaterandmoreextensivejurisdictionswerefrequentlygrantedtothem3.
891 [7] It might, probably, be necessary to grant to such towns as were ad-
mitted to farm their own revenues some sort of compulsive jurisdiction to
oblige their own citizens to make payment. In those disorderly times it
mighthavebeenextremelyinconvenienttohaveleftthemtoseekthissort

who were not strong enough to defend themselves, were obliged either to
have recourse to the protection of some great lord, and in order to obtain
it to become either his slaves or vassals; or to enter into a league of mu-
tual defence for the common protection of one another. The inhabitants

ofcitiesandburghs, consideredassingleindividuals, hadnopowertode-
fend themselves: but by entering into a league of mutual defence with G.ed.p402
theirneighbours,theywerecapableofmakingnocontemptibleresistance.
The lords despised the burghers, whom they considered not only as of a
different order, but as a parcel of emancipated slaves, almost of a differ-
ent species from themselves. The wealth of the burghers never failed to
provoketheirenvyandindignation, andtheyplunderedthemuponevery
occasion without mercy or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and
fearedthelords. Thekinghatedandfearedthemtoo;butthoughperhaps
hemightdespise,hehadnoreasoneithertohateorfeartheburghers. Mu-
tual interest, therefore, disposed them to support the king, and the king
to support them against the lords. They were the enemies of his enemies,
anditwashisinteresttorenderthemassecureandindependentofthose
enemiesashecould. Bygrantingthemmagistratesoftheirown,thepriv-
ilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of building walls
for their own defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a
sort of military discipline, he gave them all the means of security and in-
dependencyofthebaronswhichitwasinhispowertobestow. Withoutthe
establishment of some regular government of this kind, without some au-
thoritytocompeltheirinhabitantstoactaccordingtosomecertainplanor
system, no voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded
them any permanent security, or have enabled them to give the king any
considerable support. By granting them the farm of their town in fee, he
took away from those whom he wished to have for his friends, and, if one
maysayso,forhisallies,allgroundofjealousyandsuspicionthathewas
ever afterwards to oppress them, either by raising the farm rent of their
townorbygrantingittosomeotherfarmer.
893 [9] The princes who lived upon the worst terms with their barons seem
accordingly to have been the most liberal in grants of this kind to their
burghs. King John of England, for example, appears to have been a most
munificent benefactor to his towns4. Philip the First of France lost all
authority over his barons. Towards the end of his reign, his son Lewis, G.ed.p403
known afterwards by the name of Lewis the Fat, consulted, according to
FatherDaniel,withthebishopsoftheroyaldemesnesconcerningthemost
proper means of restraining the violence of the great lords. Their advice
consisted of two different proposals. One was to erect a new order of jur-
isdiction, by establishing magistrates and a town council in every consid-
erable town of his demesnes. The other was to form a new militia, by
making the inhabitants of those towns, under the command of their own
magistrates,marchoutuponproperoccasionstotheassistanceoftheking.
Itisfromthisperiod,accordingtotheFrenchantiquarians,thatweareto
date the institution of the magistrates and councils of cities in France. It

midable5.
894 [10] Themilitiaofthecitiesseems,inthosetimes,nottohavebeeninferior
to that of the country, and as they could be more readily assembled upon
any sudden occasion, they frequently had the advantage in their disputes
with the neighbouring lords. In countries, such as Italy and Switzerland,
in which, on account either of their distance from the principal seat of
government, ofthenaturalstrengthofthecountryitself, orofsomeother
reason, the sovereign came to lose the whole of his authority, the cities
generally became independent republics, and conquered all the nobility
in their neighbourhood, obliging them to pull down their castles in the
countryandtolive,likeotherpeaceableinhabitants,inthecity. Thisisthe
short history of the republic of Berne as well as of several other cities in
Switzerland. IfyouexceptVenice, forofthatcitythehistoryissomewhat G.ed.p404

895 [11] IncountriessuchasFranceorEngland,wheretheauthorityofthesov-
ereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the
citieshadnoopportunityofbecomingentirelyindependent. Theybecame,
however, so considerable that the sovereign could impose no tax upon
them,besidesthestatedfarm-rentofthetown,withouttheirownconsent.
Theywere,therefore,calledupontosenddeputiestothegeneralassembly
of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and
the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to
the king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their depu-
ties seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him as a counterbalance
in those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin
of the representation of burghs in the states-general of all the great mon-
archiesinEurope.
896 [12] Order and good government, and along with them the liberty and se- G.ed.p405
curity of individuals, were, in this manner, established in cities at a time
whentheoccupiersoflandinthecountrywereexposedtoeverysortofviol-
ence. Butmeninthisdefencelessstatenaturallycontentthemselveswith

joying the fruits of their industry, they naturally exert it to better their
condition, and to acquire not only the necessaries, but the conveniences
and elegancies of life. That industry, therefore, which aims at something
more than necessary subsistence, was established in cities long before it
was commonly practised by the occupiers of land in the country. If in the

officeofcarriersbetweendistantcountriesandexchangingtheproduceof

and splendour, while not only the country in its neighbourhood, but all
thosetowhichittraded,wereinpovertyandwretchedness. Eachofthose
countries, perhaps, taken singly, could afford it but a small part either of G.ed.p406
its subsistence or of its employment, but all of them taken together could
afford it both a great subsistence and a great employment. There were,
however, within the narrow circle of the commerce of those times, some
countries that were opulent and industrious. Such was the Greek empire
as long as it subsisted, and that of the Saracens during the reigns of the
Abassides. Such too was Egypt till it was conquered by the Turks, some
part of the coast of Barbary, and all those provinces of Spain which were
underthegovernmentoftheMoors.
898 [14] The cities of Italy seem to have been the first in Europe which were
raised by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence. Italy lay in
the centre of what was at that time the improved and civilised part of
the world. The Crusades too, though by the great waste of stock and de-
structionofinhabitantswhichtheyoccasionedtheymustnecessarilyhave
retarded the progress of the greater part of Europe, were extremely fa-
vourable to that of some Italian cities. The great armies which marched

agement to the shipping of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, sometimes in trans-
portingthemthither,andalwaysinsupplyingthemwithprovisions. They
were the commissaries, if one may say so, of those armies; and the most
destructive frenzy that ever befell the European nations was a source of
opulencetothoserepublics.

Thus the wool of England used to be exchanged for the wines of France
andthefineclothsofFlanders, inthesamemannerasthecorninPoland

silksandvelvetsofFranceandItaly.
900 [16] Atasteforthefinerandmoreimprovedmanufactureswasinthisman-
ner introduced by foreign commerce into countries where no such works
were carried on. But when this taste became so general as to occasion a
considerable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expense of car-
riage, naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the same
kind in their own country. Hence the origin of the first manufactures for
distant sale that seem to have been established in the western provinces
ofEuropeafterthefalloftheRomanempire.

bytheviolentoperation,ifonemaysayso,ofthestocksofparticularmer-

eign manufactures of the same kind. Such manufactures, therefore, are
theoffspringofforeigncommerce,andsuchseemtohavebeentheancient
manufactures of silks, velvets, and brocades, which flourished in Lucca
during the thirteenth century. They were banished from thence by the
tyrannyofoneofMachiavel’sheroes,CastruccioCastracani. In1310,nine
hundred families were driven out of Lucca, of whom thirty-one retired to
Venice and offered to introduce there the silk manufacture6. Their offer
wasaccepted;manyprivilegeswereconferreduponthem,andtheybegan G.ed.p408
the manufacture with three hundred workmen. Such, too, seem to have

and which were introduced into England in the beginning of the reign of
Elizabeth; and such are the present silk manufactures of Lyons and Spit-

314 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
alfields. Manufactures introduced in this manner are generally employed
upon foreign materials, being imitations of foreign manufactures. When
the Venetian manufacture was first established, the materials were all
brought from Sicily and the Levant. The more ancient manufacture of
Lucca was likewise carried on with foreign materials. The cultivation of
mulberrytreesandthebreedingofsilk-wormsseemnottohavebeencom-
moninthenorthernpartsofItalybeforethesixteenthcentury. Thosearts
werenotintroducedintoFrancetillthereignofCharlesIX.Themanufac-
tures of Flanders were carried on chiefly with Spanish and English wool.
Spanish wool was the material, not of the first woollen manufacture of
England, but of the first that was fit for distant sale. More than one half
the materials of the Lyons manufacture is at this day, foreign silk; when
it was first established, the whole or very nearly the whole was so. No
part of the materials of the Spitalfields manufacture is ever likely be the
produceofEngland. Theseatofsuchmanufactures,astheyaregenerally

904 [20] At other times, manufactures for distant sale group up naturally, and
as it were of their own accord, by the gradual refinement of those house-
holdandcoarsermanufactureswhichmustatalltimesbecarriedoneven

naturally fertile and easily cultivated, produces a great surplus of provi-
sions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators, and on
account of the expense of land carriage, and inconveniency of river navig- G.ed.p409
ation, it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad. Abund-
ance,therefore,rendersprovisionscheap,andencouragesagreatnumber
of workmen to settle in the neighbourhood, who find that their industry
can there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniencies of life
than in other places. They work up the materials of manufacture which
the land produces, and exchange their finished work, or what is the same
thing the price of it, for more materials and provisions. They give a new
value to the surplus part of the rude produce by saving the expense of
carrying it to the water side or to some distant market; and they furnish
the cultivators with something in exchange for it that is either useful or
agreeable to them upon easier terms than they could have obtained it be-
fore. The cultivators get a better price for their surplus produce, and can
purchase cheaper other conveniences which they have occasion for. They
arethusbothencouragedandenabledtoincreasethissurplusproduceby
a further improvement and better cultivation of the land; and as the fer-
tility of the land had given birth to the manufacture, so the progress of

the manufacture reacts upon the land and increases still further its fer-
tility. Themanufacturersfirstsupplytheneighbourhood,andafterwards,
as their work improves and refines, more distant markets. For though
neither the rude produce nor even the coarse manufacture could, without
thegreatestdifficulty,supporttheexpenseofaconsiderablelandcarriage,
the refined and improved manufacture easily may. In a small bulk it fre-
quently contains the price of a great quantity of rude produce. A piece of
finecloth,forexample,whichweighsonlyeightypounds,containsinit,the
price, not only of eighty pounds’ weight of wool, but sometimes of several
thousand weight of corn, the maintenance of the different working people
and of their immediate employers. The corn, which could with difficulty

portedinthatofthecompletemanufacture,andmayeasilybesenttothe
remotest corners of the world. In this manner have grown up naturally,
and as it were of their own accord, the manufactures of Leeds, Halifax,
Sheffield, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton. Such manufactures are the
offspring of agriculture. In the modern history of Europe, their extension G.ed.p410
and improvement have generally been posterior to those which were the
offspring of foreign commerce. England was noted for the manufacture of
fine cloths made of Spanish wool more than a century before any of those

HOW THE COMMERCE OF THE TOWNS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT
OF THE COUNTRY
905 [1] THE increaseandrichesofcommercialandmanufacturingtownscontrib-
uted to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they
belongedinthreedifferentways.
906 [2] First,byaffordingagreatandreadymarketfortherudeproduceofthe
country, they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improve-
ment. This benefit was not even confined to the countries in which they
weresituated, butextended moreor lessto allthose withwhich theyhad
any dealings. To all of them they afforded a market for some part either
of their rude or manufactured produce, and consequently gave some en-
couragement to the industry and improvement of all. Their own country,
however,onaccountofitsneighbourhood,necessarilyderivedthegreatest
benefit from this market. Its rude produce being charged with less car-
riage,thetraderscouldpaythegrowersabetterpriceforit,andyetafford
itascheaptotheconsumersasthatofmoredistantcountries.
907 [3] Secondly, the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was fre-
quently employed in purchasing such lands as were to be sold, of which
a great part would frequently be uncultivated. Merchants are commonly
ambitiousofbecomingcountrygentlemen,andwhentheydo,theyaregen-
erally the best of all improvers. A merchant is accustomed to employ his
moneychieflyinprofitableprojects,whereasamerecountrygentlemanis
accustomed to employ it chiefly in expense. The one often sees his money
go from him and return to him again with a profit; the other, when once
hepartswithit,veryseldomexpectstoseeanymoreofit. Thosedifferent
habits naturally affect their temper and disposition in every sort of busi-
ness. Amerchantiscommonlyabold,acountrygentlemanatimidunder-

is not always the case, seldom ventures to employ it in this manner. If he
improves at all, it is commonly not with a capital, but with what he can
save out of his annual revenue. Whoever has had the fortune to live in a TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

observedhowmuchmorespiritedtheoperationsofmerchantswereinthis
way than those of mere country gentlemen. The habits, besides, of order, G.ed.p412
economy, and attention, to which mercantile business naturally forms a
merchant, renderhim much fittertoexecute, with profitandsuccess, any
projectofimprovement.
908 [4] Thirdly, and lastly, commerce and manufactures gradually introduced
order and good government, and with them, the liberty and security of
individuals, among the inhabitants of the country, who had before lived
almost in a continual state of war with their neighbours and of servile
dependency upon their superiors. This, though it has been the least ob-
served, is by far the most important of all their effects. Mr. Hume is the
onlywriterwho,sofarasIknow,hashithertotakennoticeofit.
909 [5] In a country which has neither foreign commerce, nor any of the finer
manufactures, a great proprietor, having nothing for which he can ex- G.ed.p413

hospitalityoftherich,andthegreat,fromthesovereigndowntothesmal-
lest baron, exceeded everything which in the present times we can easily
form a notion of. Westminster Hall was the dining-room of William Ru-
fus, and might frequently, perhaps, not be too large for his company. It
was reckoned a piece of magnificence in Thomas Becket that he strewed
the floor of his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season, in order that
the knights and squires who could not get seats might not spoil their fine
clothes when they sat down on the floor to eat their dinner. The great
EarlofWarwickissaidtohaveentertainedeverydayathisdifferentman-
ors thirty thousand people, and though the number here may have been
exaggerated, it must, however, have been very great to admit of such ex-
aggeration. Ahospitalitynearlyofthesamekindwasexercisednotmany
yearsagoinmanydifferentpartsofthehighlandsofScotland. Itseemsto
be common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little
known. ‘I have seen,’ says Doctor Pocock, ‘an Arabian chief dine in the G.ed.p114
streets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle, and invite all pas-
sengers, even common beggars, to sit down with him and partake of his
banquet.’

A tenant at will, who possesses land sufficient to maintain his family for
little more than a quit-rent, is as dependent upon the proprietor as any
servant or retainer whatever and must obey him with as little reserve.

leaders in war, of all who dwelt upon their estates. They could maintain

injustice of any one. No other persons had sufficient authority to do this.
The king in particular had not. In those ancient times he was little more
than the greatest proprietor in his dominions, to whom, for the sake of
common defence against their common enemies, the other great propriet-
orspaidcertainrespects. Tohaveenforcedpaymentofasmalldebtwithin
the lands of a great proprietor, where all the inhabitants were armed and
accustomed to stand by one another, would have cost the king, had he at-
tempted it by his own authority, almost the same effort as to extinguish
a civil war. He was, therefore, obliged to abandon the administration of
justice through the greater part of the country to those who were capable
of administering it; and for the same reason to leave the command of the
countrymilitiatothosewhomthatmilitiawouldobey.
912 [8] Itisamistaketoimaginethatthoseterritorialjurisdictionstooktheir
origin from the feudal law. Not only the highest jurisdictions both civil
and criminal, but the power of levying troops, of coining money, and even
that of making bye-laws for the government of their own people, were all G.ed.p416
rightspossessedallodiallybythegreatproprietorsoflandseveralcentur-
ies before even the name of the feudal law was known in Europe. The
authority and jurisdiction of the Saxon lords in England appear to have
beenasgreatbeforetheConquestasthatofanyoftheNormanlordsafter
it. But the feudal law is not supposed to have become the common law of
England till after the Conquest. That the most extensive authority and
jurisdictions were possessed by the great lords in France allodially long
319 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
before the feudal law was introduced into that country is a matter of fact
that admits of no doubt. That authority and those jurisdictions all neces-
sarily flowed from the state of property and manners just now described.
WithoutremountingtotheremoteantiquitiesofeithertheFrenchorEng-
lish monarchies, we may find in much later times many proofs that such
effectsmustalwaysflowfromsuchcauses. Itisnotthirtyyearsagosince
Mr.CameronofLochiel,agentlemanofLochabarinScotland,withoutany

norevenatenantinchief,butavassaloftheDukeofArgyle,andwithout
beingsomuchasajusticeofpeace,used,notwithstanding,toexercisethe
highest criminal jurisdiction over his own people. He is said to have done G.ed.p417
so with great equity, though without any of the formalities of justice; and
it is not improbable that the state of that part of the country at that time
made it necessary for him to assume this authority in order to maintain
thepublicpeace. Thatgentleman,whoserentneverexceededfivehundred
pounds a year, carried, in 1745, eight hundred of his own people into the
rebellionwithhim.
913 [9] The introduction of the feudal law, so far from extending, may be re-
gardedasanattempttomoderatetheauthorityofthegreatallodiallords.
It established a regular subordination, accompanied with a long train of
servicesandduties,fromthekingdowntothesmallestproprietor. During
the minority of the proprietor, the rent, together with the management of
hislands,fellintothehandsofhisimmediatesuperior,and,consequently,
those of all great proprietors into the hands of the king, who was charged
with the maintenance and education of the pupil, and who, from his au-
thority as guardian, was supposed to have a right of disposing of him in
marriage, provided it was in a manner not unsuitable to his rank. But
though this institution necessarily tended to strengthen the authority of
theking,andtoweakenthatofthegreatproprietors,itcouldnotdoeither
sufficientlyforestablishingorderandgoodgovernmentamongtheinhab-
itants of the country, because it could not alter sufficiently that state of
property and manners from which the disorders arose. The authority of G.ed.p418
government still continued to be, as before, too weak in the head and too
strong in the inferior members, and the excessive strength of the inferior
members was the cause of the weakness of the head. After the institu-
tion of feudal subordination, the king was as incapable of restraining the
violence of the great lords as before. They still continued to make war ac-
cording to their own discretion, almost continually upon one another, and
veryfrequentlyupontheking;andtheopencountrystillcontinuedtobea
sceneofviolence,rapine,anddisorder.
914 [10] But what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have
effected,thesilentandinsensibleoperationofforeigncommerceandman-
ufactures gradually brought about. These gradually furnished the great
proprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole sur-
plus produce of their lands, and which they could consume themselves
320 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
without sharing it either with tenants or retainers. All for ourselves and
nothingforotherpeople,seems,ineveryageoftheworld,tohavebeenthe
vile maxim of the masters of mankind. As soon, therefore, as they could
findamethodofconsumingthewholevalueoftheirrentsthemselves,they
had no disposition to share them with any other persons. For a pair of
diamondbuckles, perhaps, orforsomethingasfrivolousanduseless, they G.ed.p419
exchanged the maintenance, or what is the same thing, the price of the
maintenance of a thousand men for a year, and with it the whole weight
and authority which it could give them. The buckles, however, were to
be all their own, and no other human creature was to have any share of
them; whereas in the more ancient method of expense they must have
shared with at least a thousand people. With the judges that were to de-
terminethepreferencethisdifferencewasperfectlydecisive;andthus,for
thegratificationofthemostchildish, themeanest, andthemostsordidof
allvanities,theygraduallybarteredtheirwholepowerandauthority.
915 [11] In a country where there is no foreign commerce, nor any of the finer
manufactures, a man of ten thousand a year cannot well employ his rev-
enueinanyotherwaythaninmaintaining,perhaps,athousandfamilies,
who are all of them necessarily at his command. In the present state of
Europe, a man of ten thousand a year can spend his whole revenue, and
hegenerallydoesso,withoutdirectlymaintainingtwentypeople,orbeing
able to command more than ten footmen not worth the commanding. In- G.ed.p420

thanhecouldhavedonebytheancientmethodofexpense. Forthoughthe
quantityofpreciousproductionsforwhichheexchangeshiswholerevenue
beverysmall,thenumberofworkmenemployedincollectingandprepar-
ing it must necessarily have been very great. Its great price generally
arisesfromthewagesoftheirlabour,andtheprofitsofalltheirimmediate
employers. By paying that price he indirectly pays all those wages and
profitsandthusindirectlycontributestothemaintenanceofallthework-
men and their employers. He generally contributes, however, but a very
smallproportiontothatofeach,toveryfewperhapsatenth,tomanynota

of their whole annual maintenance. Though he contributes, therefore, to
themaintenanceofthemall,theyareallmoreorlessindependentofhim,
becausegenerallytheycanallbemaintainedwithouthim.
916 [12] When the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining
their tenants and retainers, each of them maintains entirely all his own
tenantsandallhisownretainers. Butwhentheyspendtheminmaintain-
ing tradesmen and artificers, they may, all of them taken together, per-
haps, maintain as great, or, on account of the waste which attends rustic
hospitality,agreaternumberofpeoplethanbefore. Eachofthem,however,
taken singly, contributes often but a very small share to the maintenance
of any individual of this greater number. Each tradesman or artificer de-
riveshissubsistencefromtheemployment,notofone,butofahundredor
321 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
athousanddifferentcustomers. Thoughinsomemeasureobligedtothem
all,therefore,heisnotabsolutelydependentuponanyoneofthem.
917 [13] The personal expense of the great proprietors having in this manner
gradually increased, it was impossible that the number of their retain-
ers should not as gradually diminish till they were at last dismissed al-
together. The same cause gradually led them to dismiss the unnecessary
partoftheirtenants. Farmswereenlarged,andtheoccupiersofland,not-
withstanding the complaints of depopulation, reduced to the number ne-
cessaryforcultivatingit,accordingtotheimperfectstateofcultivationand
improvement in those times. By the removal of the unnecessary mouths,
and by exacting from the farmer the full value of the farm, a greater sur-
plus,orwhatisthesamething,thepriceofagreatersurplus,wasobtained
fortheproprietor,whichthemerchantsandmanufacturerssoonfurnished
him with a method of spending upon his own person in the same manner G.ed.p421
as he had done the rest. The same cause continuing to operate, he was

tiononly,thattheyshouldbesecuredintheirpossessionforsuchatermof
yearsasmightgivethemtimetorecoverwithprofitwhatevertheyshould
lay out in the further improvement of the land. The expensive vanity of
the landlord made him willing to accept of this condition; and hence the
originoflongleases.
918 [14] Even a tenant at will, who pays the full value of the land, is not al-
together dependent upon the landlord. The pecuniary advantages which
they receive from one another are mutual and equal, and such a tenant
will expose neither his life nor his fortune in the service of the proprietor.

919 [15] The tenants having in this manner become independent, and the re-
tainers being dismissed, the great proprietors were no longer capable of
interrupting the regular execution of justice or of disturbing the peace of
the country. Having sold their birthright, not like Esau for a mess of pot-
tage in time of hunger and necessity, but in the wantonness of plenty, for
trinketsandbaubles,fittertobetheplaythingsofchildrenthantheserious
pursuits of men, they became as insignificant as any substantial burgher
ortradesmaninacity. Aregulargovernmentwasestablishedinthecoun-
try as well as in the city, nobody having sufficient power to disturb its
operationsintheoneanymorethanintheother.
920 [16] It does not, perhaps, relate to the present subject, but I cannot help
remarking it, that very old families, such as have possessed some consid-
erable estate from father to son for many successive generations are very
rare in commercial countries. In countries which have little commerce,
onthecontrary,suchasWalesorthehighlandsofScotland,theyarevery
322 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
common. TheArabianhistoriesseemtobeallfullofgenealogies,andthere G.ed.p422
isahistorywrittenbyaTartarKhan,whichhasbeentranslatedintosev-
eralEuropeanlanguages,andwhichcontainsscarceanythingelse;aproof
that ancient families are very common among those nations. In countries
where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other way than by main-
taining as many people as it can maintain, he is not apt to run out, and
his benevolence it seems is seldom so violent as to attempt to maintain
more than he can afford. But where he can spend the greatest revenue
uponhisownperson,hefrequentlyhasnoboundstohisexpense,because
he frequently has no bounds to his vanity or to his affection for his own
person. In commercial countries, therefore, riches, in spite of the most vi-
olent regulations of law to prevent their dissipation, very seldom remain
long in the same family. Among simple nations, on the contrary, they fre-
quentlydowithoutanyregulationsoflaw,foramongnationsofshepherds,
such as the Tartars and Arabs, the consumable nature of their property
necessarilyrendersallsuchregulationsimpossible.
921 [17] Arevolutionofthegreatestimportancetothepublichappinesswasin
this manner brought about by two different orders of people who had not
theleastintentiontoservethepublic. Togratifythemostchildishvanity
wasthesolemotiveofthegreatproprietors. Themerchantsandartificers,

was to be got. Neither of them had either knowledge or foresight of that
great revolution which the folly of the one, and the industry of the other,
wasgraduallybringingabout.
922 [18] It is thus that through the greater part of Europe the commerce and
manufacturesofcities,insteadofbeingtheeffect,havebeenthecauseand
occasionoftheimprovementandcultivationofthecountry.
923 [19] This order, however, being contrary to the natural course of things,
is necessarily both slow and uncertain. Compare the slow progress of
those European countries of which the wealth depends very much upon
their commerce and manufactures with the rapid advances of our North
American colonies, of which the wealth is founded altogether in agricul- G.ed.p423
ture. Through the greater part of Europe the number of inhabitants is
not supposed to double in less than five hundred years. In several of our
NorthAmericancolonies,itisfoundtodoubleintwentyorfive-and-twenty
years. In Europe, the law of primogeniture and perpetuities of different
kinds prevent the division of great estates, and thereby hinder the mul-
tiplication of small proprietors. A small proprietor, however, who knows
every part of his little territory, who views it with all the affection which
property, especiallysmallproperty, naturallyinspires, andwhouponthat
account takes pleasure not only in cultivating but in adorning it, is gen-
erally of all improvers the most industrious, the most intelligent, and the
most successful. The same regulations, besides, keep so much land out of
the market that there are always more capitals to buy than there is land
323 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to sell, so that what is sold always sells at a monopoly price. The rent
never pays the interest of the purchase-money, and is, besides, burdened
with repairs and other occasional charges to which the interest of money
is not liable. To purchase land is everywhere in Europe a most unprofit-
able employment of a small capital. For the sake of the superior security,
indeed, a man of moderate circumstances, when he retires from business,
will sometimes choose to lay out his little capital in land. A man of pro-
fession too, whose revenue is derived from. another source, often loves to
secure his savings in the same way. But a young man, who, instead of
applying to trade or to some profession, should employ a capital of two or
threethousandpoundsinthepurchaseandcultivationofasmallpieceof

tion, which by a different employment of his stock he might have had the
samechanceofacquiringwithotherpeople. Suchapersontoo,thoughhe
cannot aspire at being a proprietor, will often disdain to be a farmer. The
smallquantityofland,therefore,whichisbroughttomarket,andthehigh
priceofwhatisbroughtthither, preventsagreatnumberofcapitalsfrom
beingemployedinitscultivationandimprovementwhichwouldotherwise
havetakenthatdirection. InNorthAmerica,onthecontrary,fiftyorsixty
pounds is often found a sufficient stock to begin a plantation with. The
purchase and improvement of uncultivated land is there the most profit-
ableemploymentofthesmallestaswellasofthegreatestcapitals,andthe G.ed.p424
most direct road to all the fortune and illustration which can be acquired
in that country. Such land, indeed, is in North America to be had almost
for nothing, or at a price much below the value of the natural produce-
a thing impossible in Europe, or, indeed, in any country where all lands
have long been private property. If landed estates, however, were divided

924 [20] England, on account of the natural fertility of the soil, of the great ex-
tent of the sea-coast in proportion to that of the whole country, and of the
manynavigableriverswhichrunthroughitandaffordtheconveniencyof
water carriage to some of the most inland parts of it, is perhaps as well
fitted by nature as any large country in Europe to be the seat of foreign
commerce, of manufactures for distant sale, and of all the improvements
which these can occasion. From the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth
too,theEnglishlegislaturehasbeenpeculiarlyattentivetotheinterestsof
commerceandmanufactures,andinrealitythereisnocountryinEurope,
Holland itself not excepted, of which the law is, upon the whole, more fa-
vourable to this sort of industry. Commerce and manufactures have ac-
324 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
cordingly been continually advancing during all this period. The cultiva-
tionandimprovementofthecountryhas,nodoubt,beengraduallyadvan-

rapid progress of commerce and manufactures. The greater part of the
countrymustprobablyhavebeencultivatedbeforethereignofElizabeth;
andaverygreatpartofitstillremainsuncultivated,andthecultivationof

however, favours agriculture not only indirectly by the protection of com-
merce, but by several direct encouragements. Except in times of scarcity,
the exportation of corn is not only free, but encouraged by a bounty. In
times of moderate plenty, the importation of foreign corn is loaded with
dutiesthatamounttoaprohibition. Theimportationoflivecattle, except
from Ireland, is prohibited at all times, and it is but of late that it was G.ed.p425
permitted from thence. Those who cultivate the land, therefore, have a
monopolyagainsttheircountrymenforthetwogreatestandmostimport-
ant articles of land produce, bread and butcher’s meat. These encourage-
ments,thoughatbottom,perhaps,asIshallendeavourtoshowhereafter,

It is now more than two hundred years since the beginning of the reign
of Elizabeth, a period as long as the course of human prosperity usually
endures.
925 [21] France seems to have had a considerable share of foreign commerce
near a century before England was distinguished as a commercial coun-
try. ThemarineofFrancewasconsiderable,accordingtothenotionsofthe
times, before the expedition of Charles the VIIIth to Naples. The cultiva-
tion and improvement of France, however, is, upon the whole, inferior to
that of England. The law of the country has never given the same direct
encouragementtoagriculture.
926 [22] The foreign commerce of Spain and Portugal to the other parts of
Europe, though chiefly carried on in foreign ships, is very considerable.
That to their colonies is carried on in their own, and is much greater, on G.ed.p426
account of the great riches and extent of those colonies. But it has never
introduced any considerable manufactures for distant sale into either of
those countries, and the greater part of both still remains uncultivated.
325 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
The foreign commerce of Portugal is of older standing than that of any
greatcountryinEurope,exceptItaly.
927 [23] Italy is the only great country of Europe which seems to have been
cultivated and improved in every part by means of foreign commerce and
manufactures for distant sale. Before the invasion of Charles the VIIIth,
Italy according to Guicciardin, was cultivated not less in the most moun-
tainousandbarrenpartsofthecountrythanintheplainestandmostfer-
tile. The advantageous situation of the country, and the great number of

not a little to this general cultivation. It is not impossible too, notwith-

Of Systems of political Œconomy INTRODUCTION
929 [1] POLITICAL œconomy, considered as a branch of the science of a states-
manorlegislator,proposestwodistinctobjects: first,toprovideaplentiful
revenue or subsistence for the people, or more properly to enable them
to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves; and secondly, to
supplythestateorcommonwealthwitharevenuesufficientforthepublic
services. Itproposestoenrichboththepeopleandthesovereign.
930 [2] The different progress of opulence in different ages and nations has
given occasion to two different systems of political œconomy with regard
to enriching the people. The one may be called the system of commerce,
theotherthatofagriculture. Ishallendeavourtoexplainbothasfullyand
distinctly asI can, and shallbegin with the systemof commerce. Itis the

G.ed.p429
OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE
COMMERCIAL, OR MERCANTILE SYSTEM
931 [1] THAT wealth consists in money, or and silver, is a popular notion which
naturally arises from the double function of money, as the instrument of
commerce and as the measure of value. In consequence of its being the
instrumentofcommerce,whenwehavemoneywecanmorereadilyobtain
whateverelsewehaveoccasionforthanbymeansofanyothercommodity.
The great affair, we always find, is to get money. When that is obtained,
thereisnodifficultyinmakinganysubsequentpurchase. Inconsequence
ofitsbeingthemeasureofvalue,weestimatethatofallothercommodities
by the quantity of money which they will exchange for. We say of a rich
manthatheisworthagreatdeal,andofapoormanthatheisworthvery
littlemoney. Afrugalman,oramaneagertoberich,issaidtolovemoney;
andacareless,agenerous,oraprofuseman,issaidtobeindifferentabout
it. To grow rich is to get money; and wealth and money, in short, are, in
commonlanguage,consideredasineveryrespectsynonymous.
932 [2] A rich country, in the same manner as a rich man, is supposed to be a
country abounding in money; and to heap up gold and saver in any coun-
tryissupposedtobethereadiestwaytoenrichit. Forsometimeafterthe
discoveryofAmerica,thefirstinquiryoftheSpaniards,whentheyarrived
upon an unknown coast, used to be, if there was any gold or silver to be
foundintheneighbourhood. Bytheinformationwhichtheyreceived,they
judged whether it was worth while to make a settlement there, or if the
country was worth the conquering. Plano Carpino, a monk, sent ambas-
sador from the King of France to one of the sons of the famous Genghis
Khan,saysthattheTartarsusedfrequentlytoaskhimiftherewasplenty
of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of France? Their inquiry had the same G.ed.p430
objectwiththatoftheSpaniards. Theywantedtoknowifthecountrywas
rich enough to be worth the conquering. Among the Tartars, as among
all other nations of shepherds, who are generally ignorant of the use of
money,cattlearetheinstrumentsofcommerceandthemeasuresofvalue.
Wealth, therefore, according to them, consisted in cattle, as according to
theSpaniardsitconsistedingoldandsilver. Ofthetwo,theTartarnotion,
perhaps,wasthenearesttothetruth. TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
933 [3] Mr. Locke remarks a distinction between money and other movable
goods. All other movable goods, he says, are of so consumable a nature
thatthewealthwhichconsistsinthemcannotbemuchdependedon, and
a nation which abounds in them one year may, without any exportation,
but merely their own waste and extravagance, be in great want of them
thenext. Money, onthecontrary, isasteadyfriend, which, thoughitmay
travelaboutfromhandtohand, yetifitcanbekeptfromgoingoutofthe
country, is not very liable to be wasted and consumed. Gold and silver,
therefore,are,accordingtohim,themostsolidandsubstantialpartofthe
movablewealthofanation,andtomultiplythosemetalsought,hethinks,
uponthataccount,tobethegreatobjectofitspoliticalœconomy.
934 [4] Others admit that if a nation could be separated from all the world, it
would be of no consequence how much, or how little money circulated in
it. The consumable goods which were circulated by means of this money
would only be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of pieces;
but the real wealth or poverty of the country, they allow, would depend
altogetherupontheabundanceorscarcityofthoseconsumablegoods. But G.ed.p431
it is otherwise, they think, with countries which have connections with
foreign nations, and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars, and to
maintain fleets and armies in distant countries. This, they say, cannot be
donebutbysendingabroadmoneytopaythemwith;andanationcannot
send much money abroad unless it has a good deal at home. Every such
nation,therefore,mustendeavourintimeofpeacetoaccumulategoldand
silver that, when occasion requires, it may have wherewithal to carry on
foreignwars.
935 [5] In consequence of these popular notions, all the different nations of
Europehavestudied,thoughtolittlepurpose,everypossiblemeansofac-
cumulating gold and silver in their respective countries. Spain and Por-
tugal, the proprietors of the principal mines which supply Europe with
those metals, have either prohibited their exportation under the severest
penalties,orsubjectedittoaconsiderableduty. Thelikeprohibitionseems
ancientlytohavemadeapartofthepolicyofmostotherEuropeannations.
Itiseventobefound,whereweshouldleastofallexpecttofindit,insome
oldScotchactsofParliament,whichforbidunderheavypenaltiesthecar-
rying gold or silver forth of the kingdom. The like policy anciently took
placebothinFranceandEngland.
936 [6] When those countries became commercial, the merchants found this
prohibition,uponmanyoccasions,extremelyinconvenient. Theycouldfre-
quentlybuymoreadvantageouslywithgoldandsilverthanwithanyother
commoditytheforeigngoodswhichtheywanted,eithertoimportintotheir
own, or to carry to some other foreign country. They remonstrated, there-
fore,againstthisprohibitionashurtfultotrade.
937 [7] Theyrepresented,first,thattheexportationofgoldandsilverinorder
to purchase foreign goods, did not always diminish the quantity of those
metalsinthekingdom. That,onthecontrary,itmightfrequentlyincrease
330 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
thatquantity;because,iftheconsumptionofforeigngoodswasnotthereby
increasedinthecountry,thosegoodsmightbere-exportedtoforeigncoun-
tries,and,beingtheresoldforalargeprofit,mightbringbackmuchmore
treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them. Mr. Mun com-
pares this operation of foreign trade to the seed-time and harvest of agri-
culture. ‘Ifweonlybehold,’sayshe,‘theactionsofthehusbandmaninthe
seed-time,whenhecastethawaymuchgoodcornintotheground,weshall
accounthimratheramadmanthanahusbandman. Butwhenweconsider G.ed.p432
his labours in the harvest, which is the end of his endeavours, we shall
findtheworthandplentifulincreaseofhisaction.’
938 [8] They represented, secondly, that this prohibition could not hinder the
exportation of gold and silver, which, on account of the smallness of their
bulk in proportion to their value, could easily be smuggled abroad. That
this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to, what
they called, the balance of trade. That when the country exported to a
greater value than it imported, a balance became due to it from foreign
nations, which was necessarily paid to it in gold and silver, and thereby
increased the quantity of those metals in the kingdom. But that when it
imported to a greater value than it exported, a contrary balance became
due to foreign nations, which was necessarily paid to them in the same
manner, and thereby diminished that quantity. That in this case to pro-
hibittheexportationofthosemetalscouldnotpreventit,butonly,bymak-
ing it more dangerous, render it more expensive. That the exchange was
thereby turned more against the country which owed the balance than it
otherwise might have been; the merchant who purchased a bill upon the
foreign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it, not only for
the natural risk, trouble, and expense of sending the money thither, but
fortheextraordinaryriskarisingfromtheprohibition. Butthatthemore
the exchange was against any country, the more the balance of trade be- G.ed.p433
camenecessarilyagainstit;themoneyofthatcountrybecomingnecessar-
ily of so much less value in comparison with that of the country to which
thebalancewasdue. ThatiftheexchangebetweenEnglandandHolland,
forexample,wasfivepercentagainstEngland,itwouldrequireahundred
andfiveouncesofsilverinEnglandtopurchaseabillforahundredounces
of silver in Holland: that a hundred and five ounces of silver in England,
therefore,wouldbeworthonlyahundredouncesofsilverinHolland,and
would purchase only a proportionable quantity of Dutch goods; but that
a hundred ounces of silver in Holland, on the contrary, would be worth a
hundred and five ounces in England, and would purchase a proportion-
ablequantityofEnglishgoods: thattheEnglishgoodswhichweresoldto
Holland would be sold so much cheaper; and the Dutch goods which were
soldtoEnglandsomuchdearerbythedifferenceoftheexchange;thatthe
one would draw so much less Dutch money to England, and the other so
muchmoreEnglishmoneytoHolland,asthisdifferenceamountedto: and
that the balance of trade, therefore, would necessarily be so much more
331 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
againstEngland,andwouldrequireagreaterbalanceofgoldandsilverto
beexportedtoHolland.
939 [9] Those arguments were partly solid and partly sophistical. They were
solidsofarastheyassertedthattheexportationofgoldandsilverintrade
might frequently be advantageous to the country. They were solid, too, in
assertingthatnoprohibitioncouldpreventtheirexportationwhenprivate
peoplefoundanyadvantageinexportingthem. Buttheyweresophistical
in supposing that either to preserve or to augment the quantity of those
metals required more the attention of government than to preserve or to
augmentthequantityofanyotherusefulcommodities,whichthefreedom
of trade, without any such attention, never fails to supply in the proper
quantity. They were sophistical too, perhaps, in asserting that the high
priceofexchangenecessarilyincreasedwhattheycalledtheunfavourable
balanceoftrade,oroccasionedtheexportationofagreaterquantityofgold
andsilver. Thathighprice,indeed,wasextremelydisadvantageoustothe
merchants who had any money to pay in foreign countries. They paid so
much dearer for the bills which their bankers granted them upon those
countries. Butthoughtheriskarisingfromtheprohibitionmightoccasion
someextraordinaryexpensetothebankers,itwouldnotnecessarilycarry
any more money out of the country. This expense would generally be all
laidoutinthecountry,insmugglingthemoneyoutofit,andcouldseldom
occasiontheexportationofasinglesixpencebeyondtheprecisesumdrawn
for. Thehighpriceofexchangetoowouldnaturallydisposethemerchants
to endeavour to make their exports nearly balance their imports, in order
that they might have this high exchange to pay upon as small a sum as G.ed.p434
possible. Thehighpriceofexchange,besides,mustnecessarilyhaveoper-
atedasatax,inraisingthepriceofforeigngoods,andtherebydiminishing
their consumption. It would tend, therefore, not to increase but to dimin-
ish what they called the unfavourable balance of trade, and consequently
theexportationofgoldandsilver.
940 [10] Such as they were, however, those arguments convinced the people to
whomtheywereaddressed. Theywereaddressedbymerchantstoparlia-
mentsandtothecouncilsofprinces,tonoblesandtocountrygentlemen,by
thosewhoweresupposedtounderstandtradetothosewhowereconscious
tothemselvesthattheyknewnothingaboutthematter. Thatforeigntrade
enriched the country, experience demonstrated to the nobles and country
gentlemen as well as to the merchants; but how, or in what manner, none
of them well knew. The merchants knew perfectly in what manner it en-
riched themselves. It was their business to know it. But to know in what
manneritenrichedthecountrywasnopartoftheirbusiness. Thissubject
nevercameintotheirconsiderationbutwhentheyhadoccasiontoapplyto
theircountryforsomechangeinthelawsrelatingtoforeigntrade. Itthen
became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of foreign
trade, and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by the laws
as they then stood. To the judges who were to decide the business it ap-
332 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
pearedamostsatisfactoryaccountofthematter,whentheyweretoldthat
foreign trade brought money into the country, but that the laws in ques-
tion hindered it from bringing so much as it otherwise would do. Those
argumentsthereforeproducedthewished-foreffect. Theprohibitionofex-
porting gold and silver was in France and England confined to the coin of
those respective countries. The exportation of foreign coin and of bullion
was made free. In Holland, and in some other places, this liberty was ex-
tended even to the coin of the country. The attention of government was
turned away from guarding against the exportation of gold and silver to
watchoverthebalanceoftradeastheonlycausewhichcouldoccasionany
augmentationordiminutionofthosemetals. Fromonefruitlesscareitwas
turnedawaytoanothercaremuchmoreintricate, muchmoreembarrass-
ing,andjustequallyfruitless. ThetitleofMun’sbook,England’sTreasure
inForeignTrade,becameafundamentalmaximinthepoliticalœconomy,
not of England only, but of all other commercial countries. The inland or G.ed.p435
hometrade,themostimportantofall,thetradeinwhichanequalcapital
affords the greatest revenue, and creates the greatest employment to the
people of the country, was considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade.
Itneitherbroughtmoneyintothecountry,itwassaid,norcarriedanyout
of it. The country, therefore, could never become either richer or poorer
by means of it, except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly
influencethestateofforeigntrade.
941 [11] Acountrythathasnominesofitsownmustundoubtedlydrawitsgold
and silver from foreign countries in the same manner as one that has no
vineyards of its own must draw its wines. It does not seem necessary,
however,thattheattentionofgovernmentshouldbemoreturnedtowards
the one than towards the other object. A country that has wherewithal to
buywinewillalwaysgetthewinewhichithasoccasionfor;andacountry
thathaswherewithaltobuygoldandsilverwillneverbeinwantofthose
metals. Theyaretobeboughtforacertainpricelikeallothercommodities,
and as they are the price of all other commodities, so all other commodit-
ies are the price of those metals. We trust with perfect security that the

securitythatitwillalwayssupplyuswithallthegoldandsilverwhichwe

orinotheruses.
942 [12] Thequantityofeverycommoditywhichhumanindustrycaneitherpur-
chase or produce naturally regulates itself in every country according to
theeffectualdemand,oraccordingtothedemandofthosewhoarewilling
to pay the whole rent, labour, and profits which must be paid in order to
prepare and bring it to market. But no commodities regulate themselves
more easily or more exactly according to this effectual demand than gold
and silver; because, on account of the small bulk and great value of those
metals, no commodities can be more easily transported from one place to
333 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
another, from the places where they are cheap to those where they are
dear, from the places where they exceed to those where they fall short of
thiseffectualdemand. IftherewereinEngland,forexample,aneffectual
demandforanadditionalquantityofgold, apacket-boatcouldbringfrom
Lisbon, or from wherever else it was to be had, fifty tons of gold, which G.ed.p436
could be coined into more than five millions of guineas. But if there were
aneffectualdemandforgraintothesamevalue,toimportitwouldrequire,
atfiveguineasaton,amillionoftonsofshipping,orathousandshipsofa

943 [13] Whenthequantityofgoldandsilverimportedintoanycountryexceeds
theeffectualdemand,novigilanceofgovernmentcanpreventtheirexport-
ation. All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to keep
their gold and silver at home. The continual importations from Peru and
Brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries, and sink the price
of those metals there below that in the neighbouring countries. If, on the
contrary,inanyparticularcountrytheirquantityfellshortoftheeffectual
demand,soastoraisetheirpriceabovethatoftheneighbouringcountries,
thegovernmentwouldhavenooccasiontotakeanypainstoimportthem.
If it were even to take pains to prevent their importation, it would not
be able to effectuate it. Those metals, when the Spartans had got where-
withaltopurchasethem,brokethroughallthebarrierswhichthelawsof
Lycurgus opposed to their entrance into Lacedemon. All the sanguinary
laws of the customs are not able to prevent the importation of the teas
of the Dutch and Gottenburgh East India Companies, because somewhat
cheaper than those of the British company. A pound of tea, however, is
about a hundred times the bulk of one of the highest prices, sixteen shil-
lings, that is commonly paid for it in silver, and more than two thousand
times the bulk of the same price in gold, and consequently just so many
timesmoredifficulttosmuggle.
944 [14] It is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver from G.ed.p437
the places where they abound to those where they are wanted that the
priceofthosemetalsdoesnotfluctuatecontinuallylikethatofthegreater
part ofother commodities, which arehindered by their bulk fromshifting
theirsituationwhenthemarkethappenstobeeitheroverorunder-stocked
with them. The. price of those metals, indeed, is not altogether exempted
from variation, but the changes to which it is liable are generally slow,
gradualanduniform. InEurope,forexample,itissupposed,withoutmuch
foundation, perhaps, that during the course of the present and preceding
centurytheyhavebeenconstantly,butgradually,sinkingintheirvalue,on
account of the continual importations from the Spanish West Indies. But
to make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver, so as to raise
or lower at once, sensibly and remarkably, the money price of all other
commodities, requires such a revolution in commerce as that occasioned
bythediscoveryofAmerica.

If the materials of manufacture are wanted, industry must stop. If provi-
sions are wanted, the people must starve. But if money is wanted, barter
willsupplyitsplace,thoughwithagooddealofinconveniency. Buyingand
selling upon credit, and the different dealers compensating their credits
with one another, once a month or once a year, will supply it with less in-
conveniency. Awell-regulatedpapermoneywillsupplyit,notonlywithout
anyinconveniency,but,insomecases,withsomeadvantages. Uponevery
account, therefore, the attention of government never was so unnecessar-
ily employed as when directed to watch over the preservation or increase
ofthequantityofmoneyinanycountry.
946 [16] No complaint, however, is more common than that of a scarcity of
money. Money, like wine, must always be scarce with those who have
neither wherewithal to buy it nor credit to borrow it. Those who have
either will seldom be in want either of the money or of the wine which
theyhaveoccasionfor. Thiscomplaint,however,ofthescarcityofmoneyis
not always confined to improvident spendthrifts. It is sometimes general
through a whole mercantile town and the country in its neighbourhood.
Overtrading is the common cause of it. Sober men, whose projects have
beendisproportionedtotheircapitals,areaslikelytohaveneitherwhere- G.ed.p438

tobear,theirstockisgone,andtheircreditwithit. Theyrunaboutevery-
where to borrow money, and everybody tells them that they have none to
lend. Evensuchgeneralcomplaintsofthescarcityofmoneydonotalways
prove that the usual number of gold and silver pieces are not circulating
in the country, but that many people want those pieces who have nothing
to give for them. When the profits of trade happen to be greater than or-
dinary, overtrading becomes a general error both among great and small
dealers. Theydonotalwayssendmoremoneyabroadthanusual,butthey
buy upon credit, both at home and abroad, an unusual quantity of goods,
which they send to some distant market in hopes that the returns will
come in before the demand for payment. The demand comes before the
returns, and they have nothing at hand with which they can either pur-
chase money, or give solid security for borrowing. It is not any scarcity of
goldandsilver,butthedifficultywhichsuchpeoplefindinborrowing,and
which their creditors find in getting payment, that occasions the general
complaintofthescarcityofmoney.
947 [17] Itwouldbetooridiculoustogoaboutseriouslytoprovethatwealthdoes
not consist in money, or in gold and silver; but in what money purchases,
andisvaluableonlyforpurchasing. Money,nodoubt,makesalwaysapart
of the national capital; but it has already been shown that it generally
makesbutasmallpart,andalwaysthemostunprofitablepartofit.
948 [18] It is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in
335 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
goods that the merchant find it generally more easy to buy goods with
money than to buy money with goods; but because money is the known
and established instrument of commerce, for which everything is readily
given in exchange, but which is not always with equal readiness to be got
in exchange for everything. The greater part of goods, besides, are more
perishable than money, and he may frequently sustain a much greater
loss by keeping them. When his goods are upon hand, too, he is more
liable to such demands for money as he may not be able to answer than
when he has got their price in his coffers. Over and above all this, his
profit arises more directly from selling than from buying, and he is upon
alltheseaccountsgenerallymuchmoreanxioustoexchangehisgoodsfor
money,thanhismoneyforgoods. Butthoughaparticularmerchant,with G.ed.p439
abundance of goods in his warehouse, may sometimes be ruined by not
being able to sell them in time, a nation or country is not liable to the
same accident. The whole capital of a merchant frequently consists in
perish, able goods destined for purchasing money. But it is but a very
smallpartoftheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofacountrywhich
caneverbedestinedforpurchasinggoldandsilverfromtheirneighbours.
The far greater part is circulated and consumed among themselves; and
even of the surplus which is sent abroad, the greater part is generally
destined for the purchase of other foreign goods. Though gold and silver,
therefore,couldnotbehadinexchangeforthegoodsdestinedtopurchase
them, the nation would not be ruined. It might, indeed, suffer some loss
andinconveniency,andbeforceduponsomeofthoseexpedientswhichare
necessary for supplying the place of money. The annual produce of its
land and labour, however, would be the same, or very nearly the same,
as usual, because the same, or very nearly the same, consumable capital
would be employed in maintaining it. And though goods do not always
draw money so readily as money draws goods, in the long run they draw
itmorenecessarilythanevenitdrawsthem. Goodscanservemanyother
purposesbesidespurchasingmoney,butmoneycanservenootherpurpose

butgoodsdonotalwaysornecessarilyrunaftermoney. Themanwhobuys
does not always mean to sell again, but frequently to use or to consume;
whereashewhosellsalwaysmeanstobuyagain. Theonemayfrequently
have done the whole, but the other can never have done more than the
one-half of his business. It is not for its own sake that men desire money,
butforthesakeofwhattheycanpurchasewithit.
949 [19] Consumable commodities, it is said, are soon destroyed; whereas gold
andsilverareofamoredurablenature,and,wereitnotforthiscontinual

mentation of the real wealth of the country. Nothing, therefore, it is pre-
tended,canbemoredisadvantageoustoanycountrythanthetradewhich
consists in the exchange of such lasting for such perishable commodities.
We do not, however, reckon that trade disadvantageous which consists in
336 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
theexchangeofthehardwareofEnglandforthewinesofFrance; andyet
hardware is a very durable commodity, and were it not for this continual
exportationmight,too,beaccumulatedforagestogether,totheincredible

quantityofvictualsbeingemployedinpurchasingthem,orinmaintaining
an additional number of workmen whose business it was to make them.
It should as readily occur that the quantity of gold and silver is in every
country limited by the use which there is for those metals; that their use
consists in circulating commodities as coin, and in affording a species of
household furniture as plate; that the quantity of coin in every country is
regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by
it: increasethatvalue,andimmediatelyapartofitwillbesentabroadto

and wealth of those private families who choose to indulge themselves in
that sort of magnificence: increase the number and wealth of such fam-
ilies, and a part of this increased wealth will most probably be employed
in purchasing, wherever it is to be found, an additional quantity of plate:
that to attempt to increase the wealth of any country, either by introdu-
cing or by detaining in it an unnecessary quantity of gold and silver, is as
absurdasitwouldbetoattempttoincreasethegoodcheerofprivatefam-
iliesbyobligingthemtokeepanunnecessarynumberofkitchenutensils.
As the expense of purchasing those unnecessary utensils would diminish
instead of increasing either the quantity of goodness of the family provi-
sions, so the expense of purchasing an unnecessary quantity of gold and
silver must, in every country, as necessarily diminish the wealth which
feeds, clothes, and lodges, which maintains and employs the people. Gold
and silver, whether in the shape of coin or of plate, are utensils, it must

950 [20] Itisnotalwaysnecessarytoaccumulategoldandsilverinordertoen-
ableacountrytocarryonforeignwars,andtomaintainfleetsandarmies
337 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
indistantcountries. Fleetsandarmiesaremaintained,notwithgoldand
silver, but with consumable goods. The nation which, from the annual
produceofitsdomesticindustry,fromtheannualrevenuearisingoutofits G.ed.p441
lands, labour, and consumable stock, has wherewithal to purchase those
consumablegoodsindistantcountries,canmaintainforeignwarsthere.
951 [21] A nation may purchase the pay and provisions of an army in a distant
country three different ways: by sending abroad either, first, some part
of its accumulated gold and silver, or, secondly, some part of the annual
produce of its manufactures; or, last of all, some part of its annual rude
produce.
952 [22] The gold and silver which can properly be considered as accumulated
or stored up in any country may be distinguished into three parts: first,
the circulating money; secondly, the plate of private families; and, last of
all, the money which may have been collected by many years’ parsimony,
andlaidupinthetreasuryoftheprince.
953 [23] It can seldom happen that much can be spared from the circulating
money of the country; because in that there can seldom be much redund-
ancy. Thevalueofgoodsannuallyboughtandsoldinanycountryrequires
acertainquantityofmoneytocirculateanddistributethemtotheirproper
consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circula-
tionnecessarilydrawstoitselfasumsufficienttofillit,andneveradmits
any more. Something, however, is generally withdrawn from this chan-
nel in the case of foreign war. By the great number of people who are
maintained abroad, fewer are maintained at home. Fewer goods are cir-
culated there, and less money becomes necessary to circulate them. An
extraordinary quantity of paper money, of some sort or other, such as ex-
chequer notes, navy bills, and bank bills in England, is generally issued
upon such occasions, and by supplying the place of circulating gold and
silver, givesan opportunity of sending a greater quantityof it abroad. All
this, however, could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a foreign
warofgreatexpenseandseveralyearsduration.
954 [24] Themeltingdowntheplateofprivatefamilieshasuponeveryoccasion
been found a still more insignificant one. The French, in the beginning of
the last war, did not derive so much advantage from this expedient as to
compensatethelossofthefashion.
955 [25] Theaccumulatedtreasuresoftheprincehave,informertimes,afforded
a much greater and more lasting resource. In the present times, if you
except the king of Prussia, to accumulate treasure seems to be no part of
thepolicyofEuropeanprinces.

two shillings in the pound land-tax, and what was annually borrowed of
the sinking fund. More than two-thirds of this expense were laid out in
distantcountries;inGermany,Portugal,America,intheportsoftheMedi-

thanusualduringanypartofthisperiod. Fewpeoplewantedmoneywho
had wherewithal to pay for it. The profits of foreign trade, indeed, were
greater than usual during the whole war; but especially towards the end
ofit. Thisoccasioned,whatitalwaysoccasions,ageneralovertradinginall
the parts of Great Britain; and this again occasioned the usual complaint
of the scarcity of money, which always follows overtrading. Many people
wanted it, who had neither wherewithal to buy it, nor credit to borrow it;
and because the debtors found it difficult to borrow, the creditors found it
difficulttogetpayment. Goldandsilver,however,weregenerallytobehad G.ed.p443
fortheirvalue,bythosewhohadthatvaluetogiveforthem.
957 [27] Theenormousexpenseofthelatewar,therefore,musthavebeenchiefly
defrayed, not by the exportation of gold and silver, but by that of British
commodities of some kind or other. When the government, or those who
acted under them, contracted with a merchant for a remittance to some
foreign country, he would naturally endeavour to pay his foreign corres-
pondent,uponwhomhehadgrantedabill,bysendingabroadrathercom-
modities than gold and silver. If the commodities of Great Britain were
not in demand in that country, he would endeavour to send them to some
other country, in which he could purchase a bill upon that country. The
transportation of commodities, when properly suited to the market, is al-
waysattendedwithaconsiderableprofit;whereasthatofgoldandsilveris
scarceeverattendedwithany. Whenthosemetalsaresentabroadinorder

naturally, therefore, exerts his invention to find out a way of paying his

andsilver. ThegreatquantityofBritishgoodsexportedduringthecourse

bytheauthorofThePresentStateoftheNation.
958 [28] Besides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned, there is in
allgreatcommercialcountriesagooddealofbullionalternatelyimported
and exported for the purposes of foreign trade. This bullion, as it circu-
lates among different commercial countries in the same manner as the
national coin circulates in every particular country, may be considered as
the money of the great mercantile republic. The national coin receives its
movement and direction from the commodities circulated within the pre-
cincts of each particular country: the money of the mercantile republic,
from those circulated between different countries. Both are employed in
facilitating exchanges, the one between different individuals of the same,
the other between those of different nations. Part of this money of the
great mercantile republic may have been, and probably was, employed in
carrying on the late war. In time of a general war, it is natural to sup-
posethatamovementanddirectionshouldbeimpresseduponit,different
from what it usually follows in profound peace; that it should circulate
moreabouttheseatofthewar,andbemoreemployedinpurchasingthere,
and in the neighbouring countries, the pay and provisions of the different
armies. ButwhateverpartofthismoneyofthemercantilerepublicGreat G.ed.p444
Britain may have annually employed in this manner, it must have been
annually purchased, either with British commodities, or with something
elsethathadbeenpurchasedwiththem;whichstillbringsusbacktocom-
modities, to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, as
the ultimate resources which enabled us to carry on the war. It is nat-
ural indeed to suppose that so great an annual expense must have been
defrayed from a great annual produce. The expense of 1761, for example,
amounted to more than nineteen millions. No accumulation could have
supportedsogreatanannualprofusion. Thereisnoannualproduceeven
of gold and silver which could have supported it. The whole gold and sil-
verannuallyimportedintobothSpainandPortugal,accordingtothebest
accounts, does not commonly much exceed six millions sterling, which, in
someyears,wouldscarcehavepaidfourmonth’sexpenseofthelatewar.
959 [29] The commodities most proper for being transported to distant coun-
tries, inordertopurchasethereeitherthepayandprovisionsofanarmy,
orsomepartofthemoneyofthemercantilerepublictobeemployedinpur-
chasingthem,seemtobethefinerandmoreimprovedmanufactures;such
as contain a great value in a small bulk, and can, therefore, be exported
to a great distance at little expense. A country whose industry produces
a great annual surplus of such manufactures, which are usually exported
to foreign countries, may carry on for many years a very expensive for-
eign war without either exporting any considerable quantity of gold and
silver, or even having any such quantity to export. A considerable part of
340 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the annual surplus of its manufactures must, indeed, in this case be ex-
portedwithoutbringingbackanyreturnstothecountry,thoughitdoesto
the merchant; the government purchasing of the merchant his bills upon
foreign countries, in order to purchase there the pay and provisions of an
army. Somepartofthissurplus,however,maystillcontinuetobringback
a return. The manufacturers, during the war, will have a double demand
upon them, and be called upon, first, to work up goods to be sent abroad,
for paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provi-
sions of the army; and, secondly, to work up such as are necessary for
purchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the
country. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore, the G.ed.p445
greater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly; and, on the
contrary, they may decline on the return of the peace. They may flourish
amidsttheruinoftheircountry,andbegintodecayuponthereturnofits
prosperity. The different state of many different branches of the British
manufacturesduringthelatewar,andforsometimeafterthepeace,may
serveasanillustrationofwhathasbeenjustnowsaid.
960 [30] No foreign war of great expense or duration could conveniently be car-
ried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil. The expense
of sending such a quantity of it to a foreign country as might purchase
the pay and provisions of an army would be too great. Few countries pro-
ducemuchmorerudeproducethanwhatissufficientforthesubsistenceof

Itisotherwisewiththeexportationofmanufactures. Themaintenanceof
the people employed in them is kept at home, and only the surplus part
of their work is exported. Mr. Hume frequently takes notice of the in-
ability of the ancient kings of England to carry on, without interruption,
anyforeignwaroflongduration. TheEnglish,inthosedays,hadnothing
wherewithaltopurchasethepayandprovisionsoftheirarmiesinforeign
countries,buteithertherudeproduceofthesoil,ofwhichnoconsiderable
part could be spared from the home consumption, or a few manufactures
of the coarsest kind, of which, as well as of the rude produce, the trans-
portation was too expensive. This inability did not arise from the want
of money, but of the finer and more improved manufactures. Buying and
sellingwastransactedbymeansofmoneyinEnglandthenaswellasnow.
The quantity of circulating money must have borne the same proportion

961 [31] The importation of gold and silver is not the principal, much less
the sole benefit which a nation derives from its foreign trade. Between
whatever places foreign trade is carried on, they all of them derive two
distinct benefits from it. It carries out that surplus part of the produce
of their land and labour for which there is no demand among them, and
brings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand.
It gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something
else, which may satisfy a part of their wants, and increase their enjoy-
ments. Bymeansofit,thenarrownessofthehomemarketdoesnothinder G.ed.p447

ket for whatever part of the produce of their labour may exceed the home

to augment its annual produce to the utmost, and thereby to increase the
realrevenueandwealthofthesociety. Thesegreatandimportantservices

thoughthatinwhichthemerchantresidesgenerallyderivesthegreatest,
342 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
as he is generally more employed in supplying the wants, and carrying
out the superfluities of his own, than of any other particular country. To
import the gold and silver which may be wanted into the countries which
have no mines is, no doubt, a part of the business of foreign commerce. It
is,however,amostinsignificantpartofit. Acountrywhichcarriedonfor-
eign trade merely upon this account could scarce have occasion to freight
ashipinacentury.
962 [32] ItisnotbytheimportationofgoldandsilverthatthediscoveryofAmer-
ica has enriched Europe. By the abundance of the American mines, those
metals have become cheaper. A service of plate can now be purchased for
aboutathirdpartofthecorn,orathirdpartofthelabour,whichitwould
have cost in the fifteenth century. With the same annual expense of la-
bour and commodities, Europe can annually purchase about three times
the quantity of plate which it could have purchased at that time. But
when a commodity comes to be sold for a third part of what had been its
usual price, not only those who purchased it before can purchase three
times their former quantity, but it is brought down to the level of a much
greaternumberofpurchasers,perhapstomorethanten,perhapstomore
than twenty times the former number. So that there may be in Europe at
present not only more than three times, but more than twenty or thirty
timesthequantityofplatewhichwouldhavebeeninit,eveninitspresent
stateofimprovement,hadthediscoveryoftheAmericanminesneverbeen
made. So far Europe has, no doubt, gained a real conveniency, though G.ed.p448
surely a very trifling one. The cheapness of gold and silver renders those
metalsrather lessfit forthe purposesof moneythan theywere before. In
ordertomakethesamepurchases,wemustloadourselveswithagreater
quantity of them, and carry about a shilling in our pocket where a groat
would have done before. It is difficult to say which is most trifling, this
inconveniency or the opposite conveniency. Neither the one nor the other
could have made any very essential change in the state of Europe. The
discovery of America, however, certainly made a most essential one. By
openinganewandinexhaustiblemarkettoallthecommoditiesofEurope,

ofbefore,andwhichshouldnaturallyhaveprovedasadvantageoustothe

Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have been beneficial to all,
ruinousanddestructivetoseveralofthoseunfortunatecountries.
963 [33] ThediscoveryofapassagetotheEastIndiesbytheCapeofGoodHope,
343 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
which happened much about the same time, opened perhaps a still more
extensive range to foreign commerce than even that of America, notwith-
standing the greater distance. There were but two nations in America in
any respect superior to savages, and these were destroyed almost as soon
as discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the empires of China,
Indostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East Indies, without
having richer mines of gold or silver, were in every other respect much
richer, bettercultivated, andmoreadvancedinallartsandmanufactures
than either Mexico or Peru, even though we should credit, what plainly
deserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spanish writers con-
cerning the ancient state of those empires. But rich and civilised nations
canalwaysexchangetoamuchgreatervaluewithoneanotherthanwith
savagesandbarbarians. Europe,however,hashithertoderivedmuchless
advantage from its commerce with the East Indies than from that with G.ed.p449
America. ThePortuguesemonopolizedtheEastIndiatradetothemselves
for about a century, and it was only indirectly and through them that the
other nations of Europe could either send out or receive any goods from
thatcountry. WhentheDutch, inthebeginningofthelastcentury, began
to encroach upon them, they vested their whole East India commerce in
an exclusive company. The English, French, Swedes, and Danes have all
followed their example, so that no great nation in Europe has ever yet
had the benefit of a free commerce to the East Indies. No other reason
need be assigned why it has never been so advantageous as the trade to
America,which,betweenalmosteverynationofEuropeanditsowncolon-
ies, is free to all its subjects. The exclusive privileges of those East India
companies,theirgreatriches,thegreatfavourandprotectionwhichthese
haveprocuredthemfromtheirrespectivegovernments,haveexcitedmuch
envy against them. This envy has frequently represented their trade as
altogether pernicious, on account of the great quantities of silver which
it every year exports from the countries from which it is carried on. The
partiesconcernedhaverepliedthattheirtrade,bythiscontinualexporta-
tion of silver, might indeed tend to impoverish Europe in general, but not
the particular country from which it was carried on; because, by the ex-
portationofapartofthereturnstootherEuropeancountries,itannually
brought home a much greater quantity of that metal than it carried out.
BoththeobjectionandthereplyarefoundedinthepopularnotionwhichI
havebeenjustnowexamining. Itisthereforeunnecessarytosayanything
further about either. By the annual exportation of silver to the East In-
dies,plateisprobablysomewhatdearerinEuropethanitotherwisemight
have been; and coined silver probably purchases a larger quantity both of
labour and commodities. The former of these two effects is a very small
loss, the latter a very small advantage; both too insignificant to deserve
any part of the public attention. The trade to the East Indies, by opening
amarkettothecommoditiesofEurope,or,whatcomesnearlytothesame
thing, to the gold and silver which is purchased with those commodities,
344 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
mustnecessarilytendtoincreasetheannualproductionofEuropeancom-
modities, and consequently the real wealth and revenue of Europe. That

whichiteverywherelaboursunder.
964 [34] Ithoughtitnecessary, thoughat thehazardofbeingtedious, toexam-
ine at full length this popular notion that wealth consists in money, or in
gold and silver. Money in common language, as I have already observed,
frequentlysignifieswealth,andthisambiguityofexpressionhasrendered
thispopularnotionsofamiliartousthateventheywhoareconvincedofits
absurdity are very apt to forget their own principles, and in the course of
their reasonings to take it for granted as a certain and undeniable truth. G.ed.p450
Some of the best English writers upon commerce set out with observing
that the wealth of a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but
in its lands, houses, and consumable goods of all different kinds. In the
course of their reasonings, however, the lands, houses, and consumable
goods seem to slip out of their memory, and the strain of their argument
frequently supposes that all wealth consists in gold and silver, and that
to multiply those metals is the great object of national industry and com-
merce.
965 [35] The two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted
in gold and silver, and that those metals could be brought into a coun-
try which had no mines only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to
a greater value than it imported, it necessarily became the great object
of political economy to diminish as much as possible the importation of
foreign goods for home consumption, and to increase as much as possible
the exportation of the produce of domestic industry. Its two great engines
forenrichingthecountry,therefore,wererestraintsuponimportation,and
encouragementstoexportation.
966 [36] Therestraintsuponimportationwereoftwokinds.
967 [37] First, restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home
consumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they
wereimported.
968 [38] Secondly, restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds
from those particular countries with which the balance of trade was sup-
posedtobedisadvantageous.
969 [39] Those different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and
sometimesinabsoluteprohibitions.
970 [40] Exportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by
bounties, sometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign
states, and sometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant coun-
tries.
971 [41] Drawbacks were given upon two different occasions. When the home
manufactures were subject to any duty or excise, either the whole or a
part of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when
foreigngoodsliabletoadutywereimportedinordertobeexportedagain,
345 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
eitherthewholeorapartofthisdutywassometimesgivenbackuponsuch
exportation.
972 [42] Bounties were given for the encouragement either of some beginning
manufactures, or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as supposed to
deserveparticularfavour.
973 [43] By advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were pro- G.ed.p451

means by which the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity
of gold and silver in any country by turning the balance of trade in its
favour. I shall consider each of them in a particular chapter, and without

346 CHAPTER II
G.ed.p452
OF RESTRAINTS UPON THE
IMPORTATION FROM FOREIGN
COUNTRIES OF SUCH GOODS AS CAN BE
PRODUCED AT HOME
976 [1] BY restraining, either by high duties or by absolute prohibitions, the im-
portationofsuchgoodsfromforeigncountriesascanbeproducedathome,
the monopoly of the home market is more or less secured to the domestic
industry employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of importing
either live cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries secures to the
graziers of Great Britain the monopoly of the home market for butcher’s
meat. Thehighdutiesupontheimportationofcorn,whichintimesofmod-
erateplentyamounttoaprohibition,givealikeadvantagetothegrowers
of that commodity. The prohibition of the importation of foreign woollens
isequallyfavourabletothewoollenmanufacturers. Thesilkmanufacture,
though altogether employed upon foreign materials, has lately obtained
thesameadvantage. Thelinenmanufacturehasnotyetobtainedit,butis
makinggreatstridestowardsit. Manyothersortsofmanufacturershave,
in the same manner, obtained in Great Britain, either altogether or very
nearly,amonopolyagainsttheircountrymen. Thevarietyofgoodsofwhich
the importation into Great Britain is prohibited, either absolutely, or un-
dercertaincircumstances,greatlyexceedswhatcaneasilybesuspectedby
thosewhoarenotwellacquaintedwiththelawsofthecustoms.
977 [2] That this monopoly of the home market frequently gives great encour- G.ed.p453
agement to that particular species of industry which enjoys it, and fre-
quentlyturnstowardsthatemploymentagreatershareofboththelabour
and stock of the society than would otherwise have gone to it, cannot be
doubted. But whether it tends either to increase the general industry of
the society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps,
altogethersoevident.
978 [3] The general industry of the society never can exceed what the capital
of the society can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in
employment by any particular person must bear a certain proportion to
hiscapital,sothenumberofthosethatcanbecontinuallyemployedbyall
themembersofagreatsocietymustbearacertainproportiontothewhole TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
capitalofthatsociety,andnevercanexceedthatproportion. Noregulation
of commerce can increase the quantity of industry in any society beyond
whatitscapitalcanmaintain. Itcanonlydivertapartofitintoadirection
intowhichitmightnototherwisehavegone;anditisbynomeanscertain
thatthisartificialdirectionislikelytobemoreadvantageoustothesociety
thanthatintowhichitwouldhavegoneofitsownaccord.
979 [4] Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most G.ed.p454
advantageousemploymentforwhatevercapitalhecancommand. Itishis
own advantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view.
But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads
himtopreferthatemploymentwhichismostadvantageoustothesociety.
980 [5] First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home
ashecan,andconsequentlyasmuchashecaninthesupportofdomestic
industry; provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not
agreatdeallessthantheordinaryprofitsofstock.
981 [6] Thus, upon equal or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant
naturallyprefersthehometradetotheforeigntradeofconsumption,and
theforeigntradeofconsumptiontothecarryingtrade. Inthehometrade
hiscapitalisneversolongoutofhissightasitfrequentlyisintheforeign
trade of consumption. He can know better the character and situation of
the persons whom he trusts, and if he should happen to be deceived, he
knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress.
In the carrying trade, the capital of the merchant is, as it were, divided
betweentwoforeigncountries,andnopartofitisevernecessarilybrought
home,orplacedunderhisownimmediateviewandcommand. Thecapital
whichanAmsterdammerchantemploysincarryingcornfromKonigsberg
to Lisbon, and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Konigsberg, must generally
be the one half of it at Konigsberg and the other half at Lisbon. No part
of it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence of such a mer-
chant should either be at Konigsberg or Lisbon, and it can only be some
very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the residence
of Amsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being separ-
atedsofarfromhiscapitalgenerallydetermineshimtobringpartbothof
the Konigsberg goods which he destines for the market of Lisbon, and of
theLisbongoodswhichhedestinesforthatofKonigsberg,toAmsterdam:
andthoughthisnecessarilysubjectshimtoadoublechargeofloadingand
unloading, as well as to the payment of some duties and customs, yet for
thesakeofhavingsomepartofhiscapitalalwaysunderhisownviewand G.ed.p455
command, he willingly submits to this extraordinary charge; and it is in
this manner that every country which has any considerable share of the
carrying trade becomes always the emporium, or general market, for the
goods of all the different countries whose trade it carries on. The mer-
chant,inordertosaveasecondloadingandunloading,endeavoursalways
tosellinthehomemarketasmuchofthegoodsofallthosedifferentcoun-
tries as he can, and thus, so far as he can, to convert his carrying trade
348 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
intoaforeigntradeofconsumption. Amerchant,inthesamemanner,who
isengagedintheforeigntradeofconsumption, whenhecollectsgoodsfor
foreignmarkets,willalwaysbeglad,uponequalornearlyequalprofits,to
sell as great a part of them at home as he can. He saves himself the risk
and trouble of exportation, when, so far as he can, he thus converts his
foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. Home is in this manner
the centre, if I may say so, round which the capitals of the inhabitants of
every country are continually circulating, and towards which they are al-
ways tending, though by particular causes they may sometimes be driven
off and repelled from it towards more distant employments. But a capital
employed in the home trade, it has already been shown, necessarily puts
intomotionagreaterquantityofdomesticindustry,andgivesrevenueand
employmenttoagreaternumberoftheinhabitantsofthecountry,thanan
equal capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption: and one em-
ployedintheforeigntradeofconsumptionhasthesameadvantageoveran
equal capital employed in the carrying trade. Upon equal, or only nearly
equal profits, therefore, every individual naturally inclines to employ his
capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support
todomesticindustry,andtogiverevenueandemploymenttothegreatest
numberofpeopleofhisowncountry.
982 [7] Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of
domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry that
itsproducemaybeofthegreatestpossiblevalue.
983 [8] Theproduceofindustryiswhatitaddstothesubjectormaterialsupon

and he will always, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the support of
that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, or
toexchangeforthegreatestquantityeitherofmoneyorofothergoods.
984 [9] Buttheannualrevenueofeverysocietyisalwayspreciselyequaltothe
exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather
is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value. As every indi- G.ed.p456
vidual,therefore,endeavoursasmuchashecanbothtoemployhiscapital

to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He gener-
ally,indeed,neitherintendstopromotethepublicinterest,norknowshow
much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of
foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that
industryinsuchamannerasitsproducemaybeofthegreatestvalue,he
intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led
by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his inten-
tion. Norisitalwaystheworseforthesocietythatitwasnopartofit. By

much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is
an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few
wordsneedbeemployedindissuadingthemfromit.
985 [10] What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ,
and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every indi-
vidual,itisevident,can,inhislocalsituation,judgemuchbetterthanany

to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their cap-
itals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but
assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single
person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere
be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption
enoughtofancyhimselffittoexerciseit.
986 [11] To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic
industry,inanyparticularartormanufacture,isinsomemeasuretodirect
private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and
must, in almost all cases, be either a useless or a hurtful regulation. If
the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign
industry,theregulationisevidentlyuseless. Ifitcannot,itmustgenerally
be hurtful. It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to
attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.
The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes, but buys them of the
shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes, G.ed.p457
but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor
the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find it for
their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have
some advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its
produce,orwhatisthesamething,withthepriceofapartofit,whatever
elsetheyhaveoccasionfor.
987 [12] What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be
folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a
commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them
with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in
which we have some advantage. The general industry of the country, be-
ing always in proportion to the capital which employs it, will not thereby
be diminished, no more than that of the above-mentioned artificers; but
onlylefttofindoutthewayinwhichitcanbeemployedwiththegreatest
advantage. It is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage when
it is thus directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can
make. The value of its annual produce is certainly more or less dimin-
ished when it is thus turned away from producing commodities evidently
ofmorevaluethanthecommoditywhichitisdirectedtoproduce. Accord-
ing to the supposition, that commodity could be purchased from foreign
countries cheaper than it can be made at home. It could, therefore, have
350 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
been purchased with a part only of the commodities, or, what is the same
thing,withapartonlyofthepriceofthecommodities,whichtheindustry
employed by an equal capital would have produced at home, had it been
left to follow its natural course. The industry of the country, therefore, is
thus turned away from a more to a less advantageous employment, and
the exchangeable value of its annual produce, instead of being increased,
accordingtotheintentionofthelawgiver,mustnecessarilybediminished
byeverysuchregulation.
988 [13] By means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may G.ed.p458
sometimesbeacquiredsoonerthanitcouldhavebeenotherwise,andafter
a certain time may be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in the for-
eign country. But though the industry of the society may be thus carried
with advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could have been
otherwise, it will by no means follow that the sum total, either of its in-
dustry, or of its revenue, can ever be augmented by any such regulation.
The industry of the society can augment only in proportion as its capital
augments, and its capital can augment only in proportion to what can be
graduallysavedoutofitsrevenue. Buttheimmediateeffectofeverysuch
regulation is to diminish its revenue, and what diminishes its revenue is
certainly not very likely to augment its capital faster than it would have
augmentedofitsownaccordhadbothcapitalandindustrybeenlefttofind
outtheirnaturalemployments.
989 [14] Though for want of such regulations the society should never acquire
theproposedmanufacture,itwouldnot,uponthataccount,necessarilybe
the poorer in any one period of its duration. In every period of its dura-
tionitswholecapitalandindustrymightstillhavebeenemployed,though
upon different objects, in the manner that was most advantageous at the
time. In every period its revenue might have been the greatest which its
capital could afford, and both capital and revenue might have been aug-
mentedwiththegreatestpossiblerapidity.
990 [15] The natural advantages which one country has over another in pro-
ducing particular commodities are sometimes so great that it is acknow-
ledged by all the world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of
glasses, hotbeds, and hot walls, very good grapes can be raised in Scot-
land, and very good wine too can be made of them at about thirty times
the expense for which at least equally good can be brought from foreign
countries. Would it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all
foreign wines merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in
Scotland? But if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning towards
anyemploymentthirtytimesmoreofthecapitalandindustryofthecoun-
try than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an equal
quantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an absurdity, though
notaltogethersoglaring,yetexactlyofthesamekind,inturningtowards
any such employment a thirtieth, or even a three-hundredth part more of
either. Whether the advantages which one country has over another be
351 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
naturaloracquiredisinthisrespectofnoconsequence. Aslongastheone
country has those advantages, and the other wants them, it will always
be more advantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former than to
make. It is an acquired advantage only, which one artificer has over his G.ed.p459
neighbour,whoexercisesanothertrade;andyettheybothfinditmoread-
vantageous to buy of one another than to make what does not belong to
theirparticulartrades.
991 [16] Merchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest
advantagefromthismonopolyofthehomemarket. Theprohibitionofthe
importationofforeigncattle,andofsaltprovisions,togetherwiththehigh
duties upon foreign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a
prohibition, are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of
Great Britain as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants
and manufacturers. Manufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are
more easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle.
It is in the fetching and carrying manufactures, accordingly, that foreign
trade is chiefly employed. In manufactures, a very small advantage will
enable foreigners to undersell our own workmen, even in the home mar-
ket. It will require a very great one to enable them to do so in the rude
produce of the soil. If the free importation of foreign manufactures were
permitted, several of the home manufactures would probably suffer, and
some of them, perhaps, go to ruin altogether, and a considerable part of
the stock and industry at present employed in them would be forced to
find out some other employment. But the freest importation of the rude
produce of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the
country.
992 [17] Iftheimportationofforeigncattle,forexample,weremadeeversofree,
so few could be imported that the grazing trade of Great Britain could be
little affected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of which
the transportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By land they
carry themselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but their food
and their water too, must be carried at no small expense and inconveni-
ency. The short sea between Ireland and Great Britain, indeed, renders
the importation of Irish cattle more easy. But though the free import-
ation of them, which was lately permitted only for a limited time, were
rendered perpetual, it could have no considerable effect upon the interest
ofthegraziersofGreatBritain. ThosepartsofGreatBritainwhichborder
upon the Irish Sea are all grazing countries. Irish cattle could never be G.ed.p460
imported for their use, but must be driven through those very extensive
countries,atnosmallexpenseandinconveniency,beforetheycouldarrive
at their proper market. Fat cattle could not be driven so far. Lean cattle,
therefore, only could be imported, and such importation could interfere,
notwiththeinterestofthefeedingorfatteningcountries,towhich,byre-
ducing the price of lean cattle, it would rather be advantageous, but with
thatofthebreedingcountriesonly. ThesmallnumberofIrishcattleimpor-
352 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tedsincetheirimportationwaspermitted,togetherwiththegoodpriceat
which lean cattle still continue to sell, seem to demonstratethat even the
breeding countries of Great Britain are never likely to be much affected
by the free importation of Irish cattle. The common people of Ireland, in-
deed,aresaidtohavesometimesopposedwithviolencetheexportationof
their cattle. But if the exporters had found any great advantage in con-
tinuing the trade, they could easily, when the law was on their side, have
conqueredthismobbishopposition.
993 [18] Feeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly im-
proved, whereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The high
priceofleancattle,byaugmentingthevalueofuncultivatedland,islikea
bounty against improvement. To any country which was highly improved
throughout, it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than
to breed them. The province of Holland, accordingly, is said to follow this
maxim at present. The mountains of Scotland, Wales, and Northumber-
land, indeed, are countries not capable of much improvement, and seem
destinedbynaturetobethebreedingcountriesofGreatBritain. Thefreest
importationofforeigncattlecouldhavenoothereffectthantohinderthose
breedingcountriesfromtakingadvantageoftheincreasingpopulationand
improvementoftherestofthekingdom, fromraisingtheirpricetoanex-
orbitantheight,andfromlayingarealtaxuponallthemoreimprovedand
cultivatedpartsofthecountry.
994 [19] The freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could
have as little effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain as
that of live cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity,
but when compared with fresh meat, they are a commodity both of worse
quality, and as they cost more labour and expense, of higher price. They
could never, therefore, come into competition with the fresh meat, though
theymightwiththesaltprovisionsofthecountry. Theymightbeusedfor
victualling ships for distant voyages and such like uses, but could never
makeanyconsiderablepartofthefoodofthepeople. Thesmallquantityof

tedevenintimesofthegreatestscarcitymaysatisfyourfarmersthatthey
can have nothing to fear from the freest importation. The average quant-
ity imported, one year with another, amounts only, according to the very
well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade, to twenty-three
thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight quarters of all sorts of grain,
and does not exceed the five hundred and seventy-first part of the annual
353 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
consumption. Butasthebountyuponcornoccasionsagreaterexportation

tioninyearsofscarcitythanintheactualstateoftillagewouldotherwise
take place. By means of it the plenty of one year does not compensate
the scarcity of another, and as the average quantity exported is necessar-
ily augmented by it, so must likewise, in the actual state of tillage, the
averagequantityimported. Iftherewerenobounty,aslesscornwouldbe

tedthanatpresent. Thecorn-merchants,thefetchersandcarriersofcorn
between Great Britain and foreign countries would have much less em-
ployment, and might suffer considerably; but the country gentlemen and
farmers could suffer very little. It is in the corn merchants accordingly,
rather than in the country gentlemen and farmers, that I have observed
thegreatestanxietyfortherenewalandcontinuationofthebounty.
996 [21] Countrygentlemenandfarmersare,totheirgreathonour,ofallpeople,
the least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a
greatmanufactoryissometimesalarmedifanotherworkofthesamekind
is established within twenty miles of him. The Dutch undertaker of the
woollen manufacture at Abbeville, stipulated that no work of the same G.ed.p462
kindshouldbeestablishedwithinthirtyleaguesofthatcity. Farmersand
country gentlemen, on the contrary, are generally disposed rather to pro-
motethantoobstructthecultivationandimprovementoftheirneighbours’
farms and estates. They have no secrets such as those of the greater part
ofmanufacturers,butaregenerallyratherfondofcommunicatingtotheir
neighbours and of extending as far as possible any new practice which
theyhavefoundtobeadvantageous. PiusQuestus,saysoldCato,stabilis-
simusque, minimeque invidiosus; minimeque male cogitantes sunt, qui in
eostudiooccupatisunt. Countrygentlemenandfarmers,dispersedindif-
ferent parts of the country, cannot so easily combine as merchants and
manufacturers, who, being collected into towns, and accustomed to that
exclusive corporation spirit which prevails in them, naturally endeavour
toobtainagainstalltheircountrymenthesameexclusiveprivilegewhich
they generally possess against the inhabitants of their respective towns.
They accordingly seem to have been the original inventors of those re-
straints upon the importation of foreign goods which secure to them the
monopoly of the home market. It was probably in imitation of them, and
to put themselves upon a level with those who, they found, were disposed
tooppressthem,thatthecountrygentlemenandfarmersofGreatBritain
in so far forgot the generosity which is natural to their station as to de-
mandtheexclusiveprivilegeofsupplyingtheircountrymenwithcornand
butcher’smeat. Theydidnotperhapstaketimetoconsiderhowmuchless
their interest could be affected by the freedom of trade than that of the

998 [23] There seem, however, to be two cases in which it will generally be ad-
vantageoustolaysomeburdenuponforeignfortheencouragementofdo-
mesticindustry.
999 [24] The first is, when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the
defenceofthecountry. ThedefenceofGreatBritain,forexample,depends
verymuchuponthenumberofitssailorsandshipping. TheActofNavig-
ation,therefore,veryproperlyendeavourstogivethesailorsandshipping
of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country in some
cases by absolute prohibitions and in others by heavy burdens upon the
shipping of foreign countries. The following are the principal dispositions
ofthisAct.
1000 [25] First, all ships, of which the owners and three-fourths of the mariners
are not British subjects, are prohibited, upon pain of forfeiting ship and
cargo, from trading to the British settlements and plantations, or from
beingemployedinthecoastingtradeofGreatBritain.
1001 [26] Secondly, a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can
be brought into Great Britain only, either in such ships as are above de-
scribed,orinshipsofthecountrywherethosegoodsarepurchased,andof
which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the mariners are of that
particular country; and when imported even in ships of this latter kind,
they are subject to double aliens’ duty. If imported in ships of any other
country, the penalty is forfeiture of ship and goods. When this act was
made, the Dutch were, what they still are, the great carriers of Europe,
andbythisregulationtheywereentirelyexcludedfrombeingthecarriers
toGreatBritain,orfromimportingtousthegoodsofanyotherEuropean
country.
1002 [27] Thirdly, a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are
prohibited from being imported, even in British ships, from any country
but that in which they are produced, under pains of forfeiting ship and
cargo. Thisregulation,too,wasprobablyintendedagainsttheDutch. Hol-
landwasthen,asnow,thegreatemporiumforallEuropeangoods,andby
this regulation British ships were hindered from loading in Holland the
goodsofanyotherEuropeancountry.
1003 [28] Fourthly, salt fish of all kinds, whale-fins, whale-bone, oil, and blub-
ber,notcaughtbyandcuredonboardBritishvessels,whenimportedinto G.ed.p464
GreatBritain,aresubjectedtodoublealiens’duty. TheDutch,astheyare
theytheprincipal,werethentheonlyfishersinEuropethatattemptedto
supply foreign nations with fish. By this regulation, a very heavy burden
waslaidupontheirsupplyingGreatBritain.
1004 [29] When the Act of Navigation was made, though England and Holland
were not actually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between
the two nations. It had begun during the government of the Long Parlia-
ment,whichfirstframedthisact,anditbrokeoutsoonafterintheDutch
355 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
wars during that of the Protector and of Charles the Second. It is not im-
possible, therefore, that some of the regulations of this famous act may
have proceeded from national animosity. They are as wise, however, as if
theyhadallbeendictatedbythemostdeliberatewisdom. Nationalanim-
osityatthatparticulartimeaimedattheverysameobjectwhichthemost
deliberate wisdom would have recommended, the diminution of the naval
powerofHolland,theonlynavalpowerwhichcouldendangerthesecurity
ofEngland.
1005 [30] The Act of Navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the
growthofthatopulencewhichcanarisefromit. Theinterestofanationin
itscommercialrelationstoforeignnationsis,likethatofamerchantwith
regardtothedifferentpeoplewithwhomhedeals, tobuyascheapandto
sell as dear as possible. But it will be most likely to buy cheap, when by
themostperfectfreedomoftradeitencouragesallnationstobringtoitthe
goodswhichithasoccasiontopurchase;and,forthesamereason,itwillbe
mostlikelytoselldear,whenitsmarketsarethusfilledwiththegreatest
number of buyers. The Act of Navigation, it is true, lays no burden upon
foreign ships that come to export the produce of British industry. Even
the ancient aliens’ duty, which used to be paid upon all goods exported
as well as imported, has, by several subsequent acts, been taken off from
the greater part of the articles of exportation. But if foreigners, either by
prohibitions or high duties, are hindered from coming to sell, they cannot
always afford to come to buy; because coming without a cargo, they must
lose the freight from their own country to Great Britain. By diminishing
the number of sellers, therefore, we necessarily diminish that of buyers,
andarethuslikelynotonlytobuyforeigngoodsdearer,buttosellourown
cheaper, than if there was a more perfect freedom of trade. As defence,
however,isofmuchmoreimportancethanopulence,theActofNavigation G.ed.p465
is,perhaps,thewisestofallthecommercialregulationsofEngland.
1006 [31] Thesecondcase,inwhichitwillgenerallybeadvantageoustolaysome
burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry is, when
sometaxisimposedathomeupontheproduceofthelatter. Inthiscase,it
seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon the like pro-
duce of the former. This would not give the monopoly of the home market
todomesticindustry,norturntowardsaparticularemploymentagreater
share of the stock and labour of the country than what would naturally
go to it. It would only hinder any part of what would naturally go to it
frombeingturnedawaybythetaxintoalessnaturaldirection,andwould
leavethecompetitionbetweenforeignanddomesticindustry,afterthetax,
asnearlyaspossibleuponthesamefootingasbeforeit. InGreatBritain,
whenanysuchtaxislaidupontheproduceofdomesticindustry,itisusual
at the same time, in order to stop the clamorous complaints of our mer-
chants and manufacturers that they will be undersold at home, to lay a
much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the same
kind.
356 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1007 [32] Thissecondlimitationofthefreedomoftradeaccordingtosomepeople
should, upon some occasions, be extended much farther than to the pre-
cise foreign commodities which could come into competition with those
which had been taxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been
taxedanycountry,itbecomesproper,theypretend,totaxnotonlythelike
necessaries of life imported from other countries, but all sorts of foreign
goods which can come into competition with anything that is the produce
ofdomesticindustry. Subsistence,theysay,becomesnecessarilydearerin
consequence of such taxes; and the price of labour must always rise with
thepriceofthelabourers’subsistence. Everycommodity,therefore,which
is the produce of domestic industry, though not immediately taxed itself,
becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes, because the labour which
produces it becomes so. Such taxes, therefore, are really equivalent, they
say,toataxuponeveryparticularcommodityproducedathome. Inorder
to put domestic upon the same footing with foreign industry, therefore, it G.ed.p466
becomes necessary, they think, to lay some duty upon every foreign com-
modity equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities
withwhichitcancomeintocompetition.
1008 [33] Whethertaxesuponthenecessariesoflife,suchasthoseinGreatBri-
tain upon soap, salt, leather, candles, etc., necessarily raise the price of
labour, and consequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider
hereafterwhenIcometotreatoftaxes. Supposing,however,inthemean-
time,thattheyhavethiseffect,andtheyhaveitundoubtedly,thisgeneral
enhancement of the price of all commodities, in consequence of that of la-
bour, is a case which differs in the two following respects from that of a
particularcommodityofwhichthepricewasenhancedbyaparticulartax

1009 [34] First,itmightalwaysbeknownwithgreatexactnesshowfartheprice

with any tolerable exactness the tax upon every foreign to this enhance-
mentofthepriceofeveryhomecommodity.
1010 [35] Secondly,taxesuponthenecessariesoflifehavenearlythesameeffect
uponthecircumstancesofthepeopleasapoorsoilandabadclimate. Pro-
visions are thereby rendered dearer in the same manner as if it required
extraordinarylabourandexpensetoraisethem. Asinthenaturalscarcity
arising from soil and climate it would be absurd to direct the people in
what manner they ought to employ their capitals and industry, so is it
likewise in the artificial scarcity arising from such taxes. To be left to ac-
commodate, as well as they could, their industry to their situation, and
to find out those employments in which, notwithstanding their unfavour-
able circumstances, they might have some advantage either in the home
orintheforeignmarket,iswhatinbothcaseswouldevidentlybemostfor
357 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
their advantage. To lay a new tax upon them, because they are already
overburdened with taxes, and because they already pay too dear for the
necessariesoflife,tomakethemlikewisepaytoodearforthegreaterpart
ofothercommodities,iscertainlyamostabsurdwayofmakingamends.
1011 [36] Such taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a curse
equal to the barrenness of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens;
and yet it is in the richest and most industrious countries that they have
been most generally imposed. No other countries could support so great
a disorder. As the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy health un-
der an unwholesome regimen; so the nations only, that in every sort of
industry have the greatest natural and acquired advantages can subsist G.ed.p467
and prosper under such taxes. Holland is the country in Europe in which
they abound most, and which from peculiar circumstances continues to
prosper, not by means of them, as has been most absurdly supposed, but
inspiteofthem.
1012 [37] Astherearetwocasesinwhichitwillgenerallybeadvantageoustolay
some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so
therearetwoothersinwhichitmaysometimesbeamatterofdeliberation;
in the one, how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain
foreign goods; and in the other, how far, or in what manner, it may be
proper to restore that free importation after it has been for some time
interrupted.
1013 [38] The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how
far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods
is, when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or prohibitions the
importation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge in
this case naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the
like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their
manufactures into ours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in
this manner. The French have been particularly forward to favour their
ownmanufacturesbyrestrainingtheimportationofsuchforeigngoodsas
could come into competition with them. In this consisted a great part of
the policy of Mr. Colbert, who, notwithstanding his great abilities, seems
inthiscasetohavebeenimposeduponbythesophistryofmerchantsand
manufacturers,whoarealwaysdemandingamonopolyagainsttheircoun-
trymen. It is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in France
that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his country.
Thatminister,bythetariffof1667,imposedveryhighdutiesuponagreat
number of foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to moderate them in
favouroftheDutch,theyin1671prohibitedtheimportationofthewines,
brandies,andmanufacturesofFrance. Thewarof1672seemstohavebeen
inpartoccasionedbythiscommercialdispute. ThepeaceofNimeguenput
an end to it in 1678 by moderating some of those duties in favour of the
Dutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was about the
same time that the French and English began mutually to oppress each
358 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
other’s industry by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the French, G.ed.p468
however, seem to have set the first example. The spirit of hostility which
has subsisted between the two nations ever since has hitherto hindered
themfrombeingmoderatedoneitherside. In1697theEnglishprohibited
the importation of bonelace, the manufacture of Flanders. The govern-
mentofthatcountry,atthattimeunderthedominionofSpain,prohibited
in return the importation of English woollens. In 1700, the prohibition
of importing bonelace into England was taken off upon condition that the
importance of English woollens into Flanders should be put on the same
footingasbefore.
1014 [39] There may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a
probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibi-
tionscomplainedof. Therecoveryofagreatforeignmarketwillgenerally

thescienceofalegislator,whosedeliberationsoughttobegovernedbygen-
eralprincipleswhicharealwaysthesame,astotheskillofthatinsidious
and crafty animal, vulgarly called a statesman or politician, whose coun-
cils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs. When there is
noprobabilitythatanysuchrepealcanbeprocured,itseemsabadmethod
of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do an-
otherinjuryourselves,notonlytothoseclasses,buttoalmostalltheother
classesofthem. Whenourneighboursprohibitsomemanufactureofours,
we generally prohibit, not only the same, for that alone would seldom af-
fect them considerably, but some other manufacture of theirs. This may
no doubt give encouragement to some particular class of workmen among
ourselves,andbyexcludingsomeoftheirrivals,mayenablethemtoraise

ourneighbours’prohibitionwillnotbebenefitedbyours. Onthecontrary,
theyandalmostalltheotherclassesofourcitizenswilltherebybeobliged
topaydearerthanbeforeforcertaingoods. Everysuchlaw,therefore,im-
poses a real tax upon the whole country, not in favour of that particular
class of workmen who were injured by our neighbours’ prohibition, but of
someotherclass.
1015 [40] The case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how

very considerable. It would in all probability, however, be much less than

1016 [41] First, all those manufactures, of which any part is commonly exported

bythefreestimportationofforeigngoods. Suchmanufacturesmustbesold
as cheap abroad as any other foreign goods of the same quality and kind,
and consequently must be sold cheaper at home. They would still, there-

fashion might sometimes prefer foreign wares, merely because they were
foreign, to cheaper and better goods of the same kind that were made at

could make no sensible impression upon the general employment of the
people. Butagreatpartofallthedifferentbranchesofourwoollenmanu-

1017 [42] Secondly, though a great number of people should, by thus restoring
the freedom of trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employ-
mentandcommonmethodofsubsistence,itwouldbynomeansfollowthat
they would thereby be deprived either of employment or subsistence. By
the reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war, more than
a hundred thousand soldiers and seamen, a number equal to what is em-
ployed in the greatest manufactures, were all at once thrown out of their
ordinaryemployment;but,thoughtheynodoubtsufferedsomeinconveni-
ency, they were not thereby deprived of all employment and subsistence.
Thegreaterpartoftheseamen,itisprobable,graduallybetookthemselves G.ed.p470
to the merchant-service as they could find occasion, and in the meantime
both they and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people,
and employed in a great variety of occupations. Not only no great convul-
sion,butnosensibledisorderarosefromsogreatachangeinthesituation

and many of them to rapine and plunder. The number of vagrants was
scarce anywhere sensibly increased by it, even the wages of labour were
notreducedbyitinanyoccupation,sofarasIhavebeenabletolearn,ex-
ceptinthatofseameninthemerchantservice. Butifwecomparetogether
the habits of a soldier and of any sort of manufacturer, we shall find that
those of the latter do not tend so much to disqualify him from being em-
ployed in a new trade, as those of the former from being employed in any.
Themanufacturerhasalwaysbeenaccustomedtolookforhissubsistence
from his labour only: the soldier to expect it from his pay. Application
and industry have been familiar to the one; idleness and dissipation to
360 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the other. But it is surely much easier to change the direction of industry
from one sort of labour to another than to turn idleness and dissipation
to any. To the greater part of manufactures besides, it has already been
observed, there are other collateral manufactures of so similar a nature
that a workman can easily transfer his industry from one of them to an-
other. Thegreaterpartofsuchworkmentooareoccasionallyemployedin

Soldiersandseamen,indeed,whendischargedfromtheking’sservice,are
at liberty to exercise any trade, within any town or place of Great Britain
or Ireland. Let the same natural liberty of exercising what species of in-

1018 [43] To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely
restoredinGreatBritainisasabsurdastoexpectthatanOceanaorUto-

but what is much more unconquerable, the private interests of many in-
dividuals, irresistibly oppose it. Were the officers of the army to oppose

1019 [44] Theundertakerofagreatmanufacture,who,bythehomemarketsbe-
ing suddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged
to abandon his trade, would no doubt suffer very considerably. That part
of his capital which had usually been employed in purchasing materials
and in paying his workmen might, without much difficulty, perhaps, find
another employment. But that part of it which was fixed in workhouses,
and in the instruments of trade, could scarce be disposed of without con-
siderable loss. The equitable regard, therefore, to his interest requires
thatchangesofthiskindshouldneverbeintroducedsuddenly,butslowly,

OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RESTRAINTS
UPON THE IMPORTATION OF GOODS OF
ALMOST ALL KINDS FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES WITH WHICH THE BALANCE
IS SUPPOSED TO BE DISADVANTAGEOUS
PART I
Of the Unreasonableness of those Restraints
even upon the Principles of the Commercial
System

post 1692, a duty of five-and-twenty per cent of the rate or value was laid
upon all French goods; while the goods of other nations were, the greater
part of them, subjected to much lighter duties, seldom exceeding five per
cent. The wine, brandy, salt and vinegar of France were indeed excepted;
these commodities being subjected to other heavy duties, either by other
laws, or by particular clauses of the same law. In 1696, a second duty of

never been omitted in any of those general subsidies, or duties of five per
cent, which have been imposed upon all, or the greater part of the goods
enumerated in the book of rates. If we count the one-third and two-third
subsidies as making a complete subsidy between them, there have been G.ed.p474
five of these general subsidies; so that before the commencement of the
presentwarseventy-fivepercentmaybeconsideredasthelowestdutyto
whichthegreaterpartofthegoodsofthegrowth,produce,ormanufacture
of France were liable. But upon the greater part of goods, those duties
are equivalent to a prohibition. The French in their turn have, I believe,
treatedourgoodsandmanufacturesjustashardly;thoughIamnotsowell
acquainted with the particular hardships which they have imposed upon
them. Thosemutualrestraintshaveputanendtoalmostallfaircommerce
between the two nations, and smugglers are now the principal importers,
either of British goods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain.
TheprincipleswhichIhavebeenexaminingintheforegoingchaptertook
theiroriginfromprivateinterestandthespiritofmonopoly;thosewhichI
amgoingtoexamineinthis, fromnationalprejudiceandanimosity. They
are,accordingly,asmightwellbeexpected,stillmoreunreasonable. They
areso,evenupontheprinciplesofthecommercialsystem.
1022 [2] First, though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between
France and England, for example, the balance would be in favour of
France,itwouldbynomeansfollowthatsuchatradewouldbedisadvant- G.ed.p475
ageous to England, or that the general balance of its whole trade would
thereby be turned more against it. If the wines of France are better and
cheaper than those of Portugal, or its linens than those of Germany, it
would be more advantageous for Great Britain to purchase both the wine
and the foreign linen which it had occasion for of France than of Portugal
and Germany. Though the value of the annual importations from France
would thereby be greatly augmented, the value of the whole annual im-
portations would be diminished, in proportion as the French goods of the
same quality were cheaper than those of the other two countries. This
wouldbethecase,evenuponthesuppositionthatthewholeFrenchgoods
importedweretobeconsumedinGreatBritain.
1023 [3] But,secondly,agreatpartofthemmightbere-exportedtoothercoun-
tries, where, being sold with profit, they might bring back a return equal
in value, perhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French goods imported.
What has frequently been said of the East India trade might possibly be
true of the French; that though the greater part of East India goods were
bought with gold and silver, the re-exportation of a part of them to other
countries brought back more gold and silver to that which carried on the
trade than the prime cost of the whole amounted to. One of the most im-
portantbranchesoftheDutchtrade,atpresent,consistsinthecarriageof
French goods to other European countries. Some part even of the French
wine drank in Great Britain is clandestinely imported from Holland and
Zeeland. If there was either a free trade between France and England,
364 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
orifFrenchgoodscouldbeimporteduponpayingonlythesamedutiesas
thoseofotherEuropeannations,tobedrawnbackuponexportation,Eng-
land might have some share of a trade which is found so advantageous to
Holland.
1024 [4] Thirdly,andlastly,thereisnocertaincriterionbywhichwecandeterm-
ineonwhichsidewhatiscalledthebalancebetweenanytwocountrieslies,
orwhichofthemexportstothegreatestvalue. Nationalprejudiceandan-
imosity,promptedalwaysbytheprivateinterestofparticulartraders,are
theprincipleswhichgenerallydirectourjudgmentuponallquestionscon-
cerning it. There are two criterions, however, which have frequently been
appealedtouponsuchoccasions,thecustomhousebooksandthecourseof
exchange. The custom-house books, I think, it is now generally acknow- G.ed.p476
ledged, are a very uncertain criterion, on account of the inaccuracy of the
valuationatwhichthegreaterpartofgoodsareratedinthem. Thecourse
ofexchangeis,perhaps,almostequallyso.
1025 [5] When the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is
at par, it is said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are
compensated by those due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when
a premium is paid at London for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign
that the debts due from London to Paris are not compensated by those
due from Paris to London, but that a balance in money must be sent out
fromthelatterplace;fortherisk,trouble,andexpenseofexportingwhich,
the premium is both demanded and given. But the ordinary state of debt
and credit between those two cities must necessarily be regulated, it is
said, by the ordinary course of their dealings with one another. When
neitherofthemimportsfromtheothertoagreateramountthanitexports
to that other, the debts and credits of each may compensate one another.
But when one of them imports from the other to a greater value than it
exportstothatother,theformernecessarilybecomesindebtedtothelatter
in a greater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it; the debts and
creditsofeachdonotcompensateoneanother,andmoneymustbesentout
from that place of which the debts overbalance the credits. The ordinary
course of exchange, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary state of
debt and credit between two places, must likewise be an indication of the
ordinarycourseoftheirexportsandimports,asthesenecessarilyregulate
thatstate.
1026 [6] But though the ordinary course of exchange should be allowed to be a
sufficient indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between any
twoplaces,itwouldnotfromthencefollowthatthebalanceoftradewasin
favour of that place which had the ordinary state of debt and credit in its
favour. Theordinarystateofdebtandcreditbetweenanytwoplacesisnot G.ed.p477
alwaysentirelyregulatedbytheordinarycourseoftheirdealingswithone
another;butisofteninfluencedbythatofthedealingsofeitherwithmany
other places. If it is usual, for example, for the merchants of England
to pay for the goods which they buy of Hamburg, Danzig, Riga, etc., by
365 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
billsuponHolland,theordinarystateofdebtandcreditbetweenEngland
and Holland will not be regulated entirely by the ordinary course of the
dealingsofthosetwocountrieswithoneanother,butwillbeinfluencedby
that of the dealings of England with those other places. England may be
obligedtosendouteveryyearmoneytoHolland,thoughitsannualexports
tothatcountrymayexceedverymuchtheannualvalueofitsimportsfrom
thence; and though what is called the balance of trade may be very much
infavourofEngland.
1027 [7] In the way, besides, in which the par of exchange has hitherto been
computed,theordinarycourseofexchangecanaffordnosufficientindica-
tion that the ordinary state of debt and credit is in favour of that country
which seems to have, or which is supposed to have, the ordinary course
of exchange in its favour: or, in other words, the real exchange may be,
and, in fact, often is so very different from the computed one, that from
thecourseofthelatternocertainconclusioncan,uponmanyoccasions,be
drawnconcerningthatoftheformer.
1028 [8] WhenforasumofmoneypaidinEngland,containing,accordingtothe
standard of the English mint, a certain number of ounces of pure silver,
you receive a bill for a sum of money to be paid in France, containing,
according to the standard of the French mint, an equal number of ounces
of pure silver, exchange is said to be at par between England and France.

1029 [9] But, first, wecannotalwaysjudgeofthevalueofthecurrentmoneyof
differentcountriesbythestandardoftheirrespectivemints. Insomeitis
more,inothersitislessworn,clipt,andotherwisedegeneratedfromthat
standard. But the value of the current coin of every country, compared
withthatofanyothercountry,isinproportionnottothequantityofpure
silverwhichitoughttocontain,buttothatwhichitactuallydoescontain. G.ed.p478
BeforethereformationofthesilvercoininKingWilliam’stime,exchange
between England and Holland, computed in the usual manner according
to the standard of their respective mints, was five-and-twenty per cent
againstEngland. ButthevalueofthecurrentcoinofEngland,aswelearn
fromMr.Lowndes,wasatthattimerathermorethanfive-and-twentyper
cent below its standard value. The real exchange, therefore, may even at
that time have been in favour of England, notwithstanding the computed
exchangewassomuchagainstit;asmallernumberofouncesofpuresilver
actuallypaidinEnglandmayhavepurchasedabillforagreaternumberof

the late reformation of the English gold coin, much less worn than the
English,andwasperhapstwoorthreepercentneareritsstandard. Ifthe
computedexchangewithFrance,therefore,wasnotmorethantwoorthree

percentagainstEngland,therealexchangemighthavebeeninitsfavour.
Since the reformation of the gold coin, the exchange has been constantly
infavourofEngland,andagainstFrance.
1030 [10] Secondly, in some countries, the expense of coinage is defrayed by the
government;inothers,itisdefrayedbytheprivatepeoplewhocarrytheir
bullion to the mint, and the government even derives some revenue from
thecoinage. InEngland,itisdefrayedbythegovernment,andifyoucarry
apoundweightofstandardsilvertothemint,yougetbacksixty-twoshil-
lings, containing a pound weight of the like standard silver. In France, a
duty of eight per cent is deducted for the coinage, which not only defrays
the expense of it, but affords a small revenue to the government. In Eng-
land, as the coinage costs nothing; the current coin can never be much
more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it actually contains. In
France,theworkmanship,asyoupayforit,addstothevalueinthesame
manner as to that of wrought plate. A sum of French money, therefore,
containing a certain weight of pure silver, is more valuable than a sum of
Englishmoneycontaininganequalweightofpuresilver,andmustrequire
morebullion,orothercommodities,topurchaseit. Thoughthecurrentcoin
ofthetwocountries,therefore,wereequallynearthestandardsoftheirre-
spective mints, a sum of English money could not well purchase a sum of
French money containing an equal number of ounces of pure silver, nor
consequently a bill upon France for such a sum. If for such a bill no more G.ed.p479

1031 [11] Thirdly,andlastly,insomeplaces,asatAmsterdam,Hamburg,Venice,
etc.,foreignbillsofexchangearepaidinwhattheycallbankmoney;while
in others, as at London, Lisbon, Antwerp, Leghorn, etc., they are paid in
thecommoncurrencyofthecountry. Whatiscalledbankmoneyisalways
ofmorevaluethanthesamenominalsumofcommoncurrency. Athousand
guilders in the Bank of Amsterdam, for example, are of more value than
athousandguildersofAmsterdamcurrency. Thedifferencebetweenthem
iscalledtheagioofthebank,which,atAmsterdam,isgenerallyaboutfive
percent. Supposingthecurrentmoneyofthetwocountriesequallynearto
the standard of their respective mints, and that the one pays foreign bills
in this common currency, while the other pays them in bank money, it is
evident that the computed exchange may be in favour of that which pays
inbankmoney,thoughtherealexchangeshouldbeinfavourofthatwhich
pays in current money; for the same reason that the computed exchange
may be in favour of that which pays in better money, or in money nearer
to its own standard, though the real exchange should be in favour of that
whichpaysinworse. Thecomputedexchange,beforethelatereformation
367 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

Digression concerning Banks of Deposit,
particularly concerning that of Amsterdam
1032 [1] Thecurrencyofagreatstate,suchasFranceorEngland,generallycon-
sistsalmostentirelyofitsowncoin. Shouldthiscurrency,therefore,beat
any time worn, clipt, or otherwise degraded below its standard value, the G.ed.p480
state by a reformation of its coin can effectually re-establish its currency.
Butthecurrencyofasmallstate,suchasGenoaorHamburg,canseldom
consist altogether in its own coin, but must be made up, in a great meas-
ure, of the coins of all the neighbouring states with which its inhabitants
haveacontinualintercourse. Suchastate,therefore,byreformingitscoin,
will not always be able to reform its currency. If foreign bills of exchange
are paid in this currency, the uncertain value of any sum, of what is in
itsownnaturesouncertain, mustrendertheexchangealwaysverymuch
against such a state, its currency being, in all foreign states, necessarily
valuedevenbelowwhatitisworth.
1033 [2] In order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous
exchange must have subjected their merchants, such small states, when
theybegantoattendtotheinterestoftrade,havefrequentlyenacted,that
foreign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid not in common
currency, but by an order upon, or by a transfer in the books of a certain
bank, established upon the credit, and under the protection of the state;
this bank being always obliged to pay, in good and true money, exactly
according to the standard of the state. The banks of Venice, Genoa, Am-
sterdam, Hamburg, and Nuremberg, seem to have been all originally es-
tablished with this view, though some of them may have afterwards been
madesubservienttootherpurposes. Themoneyofsuchbanksbeingbetter
than the common currency of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which
wasgreaterorsmalleraccordingasthecurrencywassupposedtobemore
or less degraded below the standard of the state. The agio of the Bank of
Hamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about fourteen per
cent is the supposed difference between the good standard money of the
state,andtheclipt,worn,anddiminishedcurrencypouredintoitfromall
theneighbouringstates.
368 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1034 [3] Before1609thegreatquantityofcliptandwornforeigncoin,whichthe
extensive trade of Amsterdam brought from all parts of Europe, reduced
thevalueofitscurrencyaboutninepercentbelowthatofgoodmoneyfresh
from the mint. Such money no sooner appeared than it was melted down
or carried away, as it always is in such circumstances. The merchants,
withplentyofcurrency,couldnotalwaysfindasufficientquantityofgood
money to pay their bills of exchange; and the value of those bills, in spite
of several regulations which were made to prevent it, became in a great
measureuncertain.
1035 [4] In order to remedy these inconveniences, a bank was established in
1609undertheguaranteeofthecity. Thisbankreceivedbothforeigncoin,
andthelightandworncoinofthecountryatitsrealintrinsicvalueinthe
goodstandardmoneyofthecountry,deductingonlysomuchaswasneces- G.ed.p481
saryfordefrayingtheexpenseofcoinage,andtheothernecessaryexpense
of management. For the value which remained, after this small deduc-
tion was made, it gave a credit in its books. This credit was called bank
money, which, as it represented money exactly according to the standard
of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically worth
more than current money. It was at the same time enacted, that all bills
drawnuponornegotiatedatAmsterdamofthevalueofsixhundredguild-
ers and upwards should be paid in bank money, which at once took away
alluncertaintyinthevalueofthosebills. Everymerchant,inconsequence
of this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank in order
topayhisforeignbillsofexchange,whichnecessarilyoccasionedacertain
demandforbankmoney.
1036 [5] Bank money, over and above its intrinsic superiority to currency, and
the additional value which this demand necessarily gives it, has likewise
some other advantages. It is secure from fire, robbery, and other acci-
dents; the city of Amsterdam is bound for it; it can be paid away by a
simpletransfer,withoutthetroubleofcounting,ortheriskoftransporting
itfromoneplacetoanother. Inconsequenceofthosedifferentadvantages,
itseemsfromthebeginningtohaveborneagio,anditisgenerallybelieved
thatallthemoneyoriginallydepositedinthebankwasallowedtoremain
there,nobodycaringtodemandpaymentofadebtwhichhecouldsellfora

a bank credit would lose this premium. As a shilling fresh from the mint
will buy no more goods in the market than one of our common worn shil-
lings,sothegoodandtruemoneywhichmightbebroughtfromthecoffers
of the bank into those of a private person, being mixed and confounded
withthecommoncurrencyofthecountry, wouldbeofnomorevaluethan
thatcurrencyfromwhichitcouldnolongerbereadilydistinguished. While
it remained in the coffers of the bank, its superiority was known and as-
certained. Whenithadcomeintothoseofaprivateperson,itssuperiority
could not well be ascertained without more trouble than perhaps the dif-
ferencewasworth. Bybeingbroughtfromthecoffersofthebank,besides,
369 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
it lost all the other advantages of bank money; its security, its easy and
safe transferability, its use in paying foreign bills of exchange. Over and
above all this, it could not be brought from those coffers, as it will appear
byandby,withoutpreviouslypayingforthekeeping.
1037 [6] Those deposits of coin, or those deposits which the bank was bound to
restore in coin, constituted the original capital of the bank, or the whole
value of what was represented by what is called bank money. At present G.ed.p482
they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it. In order to
facilitate the trade in bullion, the bank has been for these many years in
the practice of giving credit in its books upon deposits of gold and silver
bullion. Thiscreditisgenerallyaboutfivepercentbelowthemintpriceof
such bullion. The bank grants at the same time what is called a recipe or
receipt, entitlingthepersonwhomakesthedeposit, orthebearer, totake
out the bullion again at any time within six months, upon re-transferring
to the bank a quantity of bank money equal to that for which credit had
beengiveninitsbookswhenthedepositwasmade,anduponpayingone-
fourth per cent for the keeping, if the deposit was in silver; and one-half
per cent if it was in gold; but at the same time declaring that, in default
ofsuchpayment, andupontheexpirationofthisterm, thedepositshould
belongtothebankatthepriceatwhichithadbeenreceived,orforwhich
credit had been given in the transfer books. What is thus paid for the
keepingofthedepositmaybeconsideredasasortofwarehouserent;and
whythiswarehouserentshouldbesomuchdearerforgoldthanforsilver,
several different reasons have been assigned. The fineness of gold, it has
been said, is more difficult to be ascertained than that of silver. Frauds
aremoreeasilypractised,andoccasionagreaterlossinthemoreprecious
metal. Silver, besides, being the standard metal, the state, it has been
said,wishestoencouragemorethemakingofdepositsofsilverthanthose
ofgold.
1038 [7] Deposits of bullion are most commonly made when the price is some-
what lower than ordinary; and they are taken out again when it happens
torise. InHollandthemarketpriceofbullionisgenerallyabovethemint
price,forthesamereasonthatitwassoinEnglandbeforethelatereform-
ation of the gold coin. The difference is said to be commonly from about
six to sixteen stivers upon the mark, or eight ounces of silver of eleven
partsfineandonepartalloy. Thebankprice,orthecreditwhichthebank
gives for deposits of such silver (when made in foreign coin, of which the

two guilders the mark; the mint price is about twenty-three guilders, and
themarketpriceisfromtwenty-threeguilderssixtotwenty-threeguilders
sixteen stivers, or from two to three per cent above the mint price.1 The
proportions between the bank price, the mint price, and the market price
ofgoldbullionarenearlythesame. Apersoncangenerallysellhisreceipt G.ed.p483

Areceiptforbullionisalmostalwaysworthsomething,anditveryseldom
happens,therefore,thatanybodysuffershisreceipttoexpire,orallowshis
bulliontofalltothebankatthepriceatwhichithadbeenreceived,either
by not taking it out before the end of the six months, or by neglecting to
pay the one-fourth or one-half per cent in order to obtain a new receipt
for another six months. This, however, though it happens seldom, is said
to happen sometimes, and more frequently with regard to gold than with
regardtosilver,onaccountofthehigherwarehouse-rentwhichispaidfor
thekeepingofthemorepreciousmetal.
1039 [8] The person who by making a deposit of bullion obtains both a bank
credit and receipt, pays his bills of exchange as they become due with his
bank credit; and either sells or keeps his receipt according as he judges
that the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall. The receipt and the
bank credit seldom keep long together, and there is no occasion that they
should. The person who has a receipt, and who wants to take out bullion,
finds always plenty of bank credits, or bank money to buy at the ordinary
price;andthepersonwhohasbankmoney,andwantstotakeoutbullion,

of those who have it. The owner of bank money cannot draw out bullion
without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants.
If he has none of his own, he must buy them of those who have them.
The holder of a receipt, when he purchases bank money, purchases the
power of taking out a quantity of bullion, of which the mint price is five
percentabovethebankprice. Theagiooffivepercenttherefore,whichhe G.ed.p484
commonlypaysforit,ispaidnotforanimaginarybutforarealvalue. The
owner of bank money, when he purchases a receipt, purchases the power
of taking out a quantity of bullion of which the market price is commonly
from two to three per cent above the mint price. The price which he pays
for it, therefore, is paid likewise for a real value. The price of the receipt,
andthepriceofthebankmoney,compoundormakeupbetweenthemthe

1041 [10] Upon deposits of the coin current in the country, the bank grants re-
ceipts likewise as well as bank credits; but those receipts are frequently
of no value, and will bring no price in the market. Upon ducatoons, for
example, whichin the currency pass for three guilders three stivers each,
the bank gives a credit of three guilders only, or five per cent below their
currentvalue. Itgrantsareceiptlikewiseentitlingthebearertotakeout

timefalltothreepercentsuchreceiptsmightbringsomepriceinthemar-
ket, and might sell for one and three-fourths per cent. But the agio of the
bank being now generally about five per cent such receipts are frequently
allowed to expire, or as they express it, to fall to the bank. The receipts
which are given for deposits of gold ducats fall to it yet more frequently,
because a higher warehouse-rent, or one-half per cent must be paid for
the keeping of them before they can be taken out again. The five per cent
which the bank gains, when deposits either of coin or bullion are allowed
to fall to it, may be considered as the warehouse-rent for the perpetual
keepingofsuchdeposits.
1042 [11] Thesumofbankmoneyforwhichthereceiptsareexpiredmustbevery
considerable. It must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank,
which,itisgenerallysupposed,hasbeenallowedtoremaintherefromthe
time it was first deposited, nobody caring either to renew his receipt or to

ceipt. Thesmallermassofbankmoney,forwhichthereceiptsareexpired,
is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which they are
still in force; so that, though there may be a considerable sum of bank
money for which there are no receipts, there is no specific sum or portion
ofitwhichmaynotatanytimebedemandedbyone. Thebankcannotbe
debtor to two persons for the same thing; and the owner of bank money

1044 [13] It might be otherwise during a public calamity; an invasion, for ex-
ample, such as that of the French in 1672. The owners of bank money
being then all eager to draw it out of the bank, in order to have it their
ownkeeping,thedemandforreceiptsmightraisetheirpricetoanexorbit-
ant height. The holders of them might form expectations, and, instead of
two or three per cent, demand half the bank money for which credit had
beengivenuponthedepositsthatthereceiptshadrespectivelybeengran-
ted for. The enemy, informed of the constitution of the bank, might even
buy them up, in order to prevent the carrying away of the treasure. In
suchemergencies,thebank,itissupposed,wouldbreakthroughitsordin-
aryruleofmakingpaymentonlytotheholdersofreceipts. Theholdersof
receipts, whohadnobankmoney, musthavereceivedwithintwoorthree
percentofthevalueofthedepositforwhichtheirrespectivereceiptshad

scruple of paying, either with money or bullion, the full value of what the
owners of bank money who could get no receipts were credited for in its
books; paying at the same time two or three per cent to such holders of
receipts as had no bank money, that being the whole value which in this
stateofthingscouldjustlybesupposedduetothem.
1045 [14] Even in ordinary and quiet times it is the interest of the holders of
receipts to depress the agio, in order either to buy bank money (and con-
sequentlythebullion,whichtheirreceiptswouldthenenablethemtotake

bank money, and who want to take out bullion, so much dearer; the price
of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the market
price of bank money, and that of the coin or bullion for which the receipt
had been granted. It is the interest of the owners of bank money, on the
contrary,toraisetheagio,inordereithertoselltheirbankmoneysomuch

the market price of bank money used sometimes to rise so high as nine
per cent agio, and sometimes to sink so low as par, according as opposite
interestshappenedtoinfluencethemarket.
1046 [15] The Bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is de-
positedwithit,but,foreveryguilderforwhichitgivescreditinitsbooks,
to keep in its repositories the value of a guilder either in money or bul-
lion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for which
there are receipts in force, for which it is at all times liable to be called
upon,andwhich,inreality,iscontinuallygoingfromitandreturningtoit
again,cannotwellbedoubted. Butwhetheritdoessolikewisewithregard
to that part of its capital, for which the receipts are long ago expired, for
which in ordinary and quiet times it cannot be called upon, and which in
reality is very likely to remain with it for ever, or as long as the States
of the United Provinces subsist, may perhaps appear more uncertain. At
Amsterdam, however, no point of faith is better established than that for
everyguilder,circulatedasbankmoney,thereisacorrespondentguilderin
goldorsilvertobefoundinthetreasureofthebank. Thecityisguarantee
that it should be so. The bank is under the direction of the four reigning
burgomasterswhoarechangedeveryyear. Eachnewsetofburgomasters
visits the treasure, compares it with the books, receives it upon oath, and
deliversitover, withthesameawfulsolemnity, tothesetwhichsucceeds;
and in that sober and religious country oaths are not yet disregarded. A
rotationofthiskindseemsaloneasufficientsecurityagainstanypractices
whichcannotbeavowed. Amidstalltherevolutionswhichfactionhasever
occasioned in the government of Amsterdam, the prevailing party has at
no time accused their predecessors of infidelity in the administration of
the bank. No accusation could have affected more deeply the reputation
and fortune of the disgraced party, and if such an accusation could have
been supported, we may be assured that it would have been brought. In
1672,whentheFrenchkingwasatUtrecht,theBankofAmsterdampaid
so readily as left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its
engagements. Someofthepieceswhichwerethenbroughtfromitsrepos-
itoriesappearedtohavebeenscorchedwiththefirewhichhappenedinthe G.ed.p487
town-house soon after the bank was established. Those pieces, therefore,
musthavelaintherefromthattime.
1047 [16] Whatmaybetheamountofthetreasureinthebankisaquestionwhich
has long employed speculations of the curious. Nothing but conjecture
can be offered concerning it. It is generally reckoned that there are about
374 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
twothousandpeoplewhokeepaccountswiththebank,andallowingthem
to have, one with another, the value of fifteen hundred pounds sterling
lying upon their respective accounts (a very large allowance), the whole
quantity of bank money, and consequently of treasure in the bank, will
amount to about three millions sterling, or, at eleven guilders the pound
sterling, thirty-three millions of guilders- a great sum, and sufficient to
carry on a very extensive circulation, but vastly below the extravagant
ideaswhichsomepeoplehaveformedofthistreasure.
1048 [17] The city of Amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the bank.
Besides what may be called the warehouse-rent above mentioned, each
person, upon first opening an account with the bank, pays a fee of ten
guilders; andforeverynewaccountthreeguildersthreestivers; forevery
transfer two stivers; and if the transfer is for less than three hundred
guilders,sixstivers,inordertodiscouragethemultiplicityofsmalltrans-
actions. The person who neglects to balance his account twice in the year
forfeits twenty-five guilders. The person who orders a transfer for more
thanisuponhisaccount,isobligedtopaythreepercentforthesumover-

too, tomakeaconsiderableprofitbythesaleoftheforeigncoinorbullion

bank money at five per cent agio, and buying it in at four. These differ-
ent emoluments amount to a good deal more than what is necessary for
paying the salaries of officers, and defraying the expense of management.
What is paid for the keeping of bullion upon receipts is alone supposed to
amount to a neat annual revenue of between one hundred and fifty thou- G.ed.p488

PART II
Of the Unreasonableness of those
extraordinary Restraints upon other
Principles
1049 [1] In the foregoing Part of this Chapter I have endeavoured to show, even
upontheprinciplesofthecommercialsystem,howunnecessaryitistolay
extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those coun-
trieswithwhichthebalanceoftradeissupposedtobedisadvantageous.
1050 [2] Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the
balanceoftrade, uponwhich, notonlytheserestraints, butalmostallthe
other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with
oneanother,thisdoctrinesupposesthat,ifthebalancebeeven,neitherof G.ed.p489
them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that
one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from
theexactequilibrium. Bothsuppositionsarefalse. Atradewhichisforced
bymeansofbountiesandmonopoliesmaybeandcommonlyisdisadvant-
ageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to be established, as I
shall endeavour to show hereafter. But that trade which, without force or
constraint,isnaturallyandregularlycarriedonbetweenanytwoplacesis
alwaysadvantageous,thoughnotalwaysequallyso,toboth.
1051 [3] By advantage orgain, Iunderstand not the increase ofthe quantityof
gold and silver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce
ofthelandandlabourofthecountry,ortheincreaseoftheannualrevenue
ofitsinhabitants.
1052 [4] If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist
altogether in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon
mostoccasions,notonlybothgain,buttheywillgainequally,orverynear
equally; each will in this case afford a market for a part of the surplus
produceoftheother;eachwillreplaceacapitalwhichhadbeenemployed
inraisingandpreparingforthemarketthispartofthesurplusproduceof
the other, and which had been distributed among, and given revenue and
maintenance to a certain number of its inhabitants. Some part of the in-
habitantsofeach,therefore,willindirectlyderivetheirrevenueandmain-
tenance from the other. As the commodities exchanged, too, are supposed
to be of equal value, so the two capitals employed in the trade will, upon
most occasions, be equal, or very nearly equal; and both being employed
in raising the native commodities of the two countries, the revenue and
maintenancewhichtheirdistributionwillaffordtotheinhabitantsofeach
will be equal, or very nearly equal. This revenue and maintenance, thus
mutuallyafforded,willbegreaterorsmallerinproportiontotheextentof
376 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
their dealings. If these should annually amount to an hundred thousand
pounds,forexample,ortoamilliononeachside,eachofthemwouldafford
anannualrevenueintheonecaseofanhundredthousandpounds,inthe
otherofamillion,totheinhabitantsoftheother.
1053 [5] If their trade should be of such a nature that one of them exported to
the other nothing but native commodities, while the returns of that other
consistedaltogetherinforeigngoods; thebalance, inthiscase, wouldstill
be supposed even, commodities being paid for with commodities. They
would, in this case too, both gain, but they would not gain equally; and
theinhabitantsofthecountrywhichexportednothingbutnativecommod-
ities would derive the greatest revenue from the trade. If England, for G.ed.p490
example, should import from France nothing but the native commodities
ofthatcountry,and,nothavingsuchcommoditiesofitsownaswereinde-
mandthere,shouldannuallyrepaythembysendingthitheralargequant-
ity of foreign goods, tobacco, we shall suppose, and East India goods; this
trade, thoughitwouldgivesomerevenuetotheinhabitantsofbothcoun-
tries, would give more to those of France than to those of England. The
whole French capital annually employed in it would annually be distrib-
utedamongthepeopleofFrance. ButthatpartoftheEnglishcapitalonly
which was employed in producing the English commodities with which
thoseforeigngoodswerepurchasedwouldbeannuallydistributedamong
the people of England. The greater part of it would replace the capitals
which had been employed in Virginia, Indostan, and China, and which
had given revenue and maintenance to the of those distant countries. If
thecapitalswereequal,ornearlyequal,thereforethisemploymentofthe
French capital would augment much more the revenue of the people of
FrancethanthatoftheEnglishcapitalwouldtherevenueofthepeopleof
England. France would in this case carry on a direct foreign trade of con-
sumption with England; whereas England would carry on a round-about
trade of the same kind with France. The different effects of a capital em-
ployed in the direct and of one employed in the round-about foreign trade
ofconsumptionhavealreadybeenfullyexplained.
1054 [6] There is not, probably, between any two countries a trade which con-
sistsaltogetherintheexchangeeitherofnativecommoditiesonbothsides,
orofnativecommoditiesononesideandofforeigngoodsontheother. Al-
mostallcountriesexchangewithoneanotherpartlynativeandpartlyfor-
eign goods. That country, however, in whose cargoes there is the greatest
proportionofnative,andtheleastofforeigngoods,willalwaysbetheprin-
cipalgainer.
1055 [7] IfitwasnotwithtobaccoandEastIndiagoods,butwithgoldandsilver,
thatEnglandpaidforthecommoditiesannuallyimportedfromFrance,the
balance, in this case, would be supposed uneven, commodities not being
paid for with commodities, but with gold and silver. The trade, however,
would, in this case, as in the foregoing, give some revenue to the inhabit-
ants of both countries, but more to those of France than to those of Eng-
377 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
land. It would give some revenue to those of England. The capital which
had been employed in producing the English goods that purchased this
gold and silver, the capital which had been distributed among, and given
revenueto,certaininhabitantsofEngland,wouldtherebybereplacedand
enabledtocontinuethatemployment. ThewholecapitalofEnglandwould G.ed.p491
no more be diminished by this exportation of gold and silver than by the
exportationofanequalvalueofanyothergoods. Onthecontrary,itwould
inmostcasesbeaugmented. Nogoodsaresentabroadbutthoseforwhich
the demand is supposed to be greater abroad than at home, and of which
the returns consequently, it is expected, will be of more value at home
thanthecommoditiesexported. Ifthetobaccowhich,inEngland,isworth
onlyahundredthousandpounds,whensenttoFrancewillpurchasewine
which is, in England, worth a hundred and ten thousand, this exchange
will equally augment the capital of England by ten thousand pounds. If a
hundred thousand pounds of English gold, in the same manner, purchase
French wine which, in England, is worth a hundred and ten thousand,
this exchange will equally augment the capital of England by ten thou-
sandpounds. Asamerchantwhohasahundredandtenthousandpounds
worth of wine in his cellar is a richer man than he who has only a hun-
dredthousandpoundsworthoftobaccoinhiswarehouse,soishelikewise
a richer man than he who has only a hundred thousand pounds worth of
gold in his coffers. He can put into motion a greater quantity of industry,
and give revenue, maintenance, and employment to a greater number of
peoplethaneitheroftheothertwo. Butthecapitalofthecountryisequal
tothecapitalsofallitsdifferentinhabitants,andthequantityofindustry
whichcanbeannuallymaintainedinitisequaltowhatallthosedifferent
capitals can maintain. Both the capital of the country, therefore, and the
quantity of industry which can be annually maintained in it, must gener-
allybeaugmentedbythisexchange. Itwould,indeed,bemoreadvantage-
ous for England that it could purchase the wines of France with its own
hardware and broadcloth than with either the tobacco of Virginia or the
gold and silver of Brazil and Peru. A direct foreign trade of consumption
is always more advantageous than a roundabout one. But a round-about
foreigntradeofconsumption,whichiscarriedonwithgoldandsilver,does
notseemtobelessadvantageousthananyotherequallyround-aboutone.
Neitherisacountrywhichhasnominesmorelikelytobeexhaustedofgold

notgrowtobaccobythelikeannualexportationofthatplant. Asacountry
which has wherewithal to buy tobacco will never be long in want of it, so
neither will one be long in want of gold and silver which haswherewithal
topurchasethosemetals.
1056 [8] It is a losing trade, it is said, which a workman carries on with the
alehouse; and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally
carry on with a wine country may be considered as a trade of the same
nature. I answer, that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a
378 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
losing trade. In its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other,
thoughperhapssomewhatmoreliabletobeabused. Theemploymentofa G.ed.p492
brewer, and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors, are as necessary
divisions of labour as any other. It will generally be more advantageous
for a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occasion for than
to brew it himself, and if he is a poor workman, it will generally be more
advantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer than a
large quantity of the brewer. He may no doubt buy too much of either, as
he may of any other dealers in his neighbourhood, of the butcher, if he is
a glutton, or of the draper, if he affects to be a beau among his compan-
ions. It is advantageous to the great body of workmen, notwithstanding,
thatallthesetradesshouldbefree,thoughthisfreedommaybeabusedin
all of them, and is more likely to be so, perhaps, in some than in others.
Thoughindividuals,besides,maysometimesruintheirfortunesbyanex-
cessiveconsumptionoffermentedliquors,thereseemstobenoriskthata
nation should do so. Though in every country there are many people who
spenduponsuchliquorsmorethantheycanafford,therearealwaysmany
more who spend less. It deserves to be remarked too, that, if we consult
experience, the cheapness of wine seems to be a cause, not of drunken-
ness, but of sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries are in general
the soberest people in Europe; witness the Spainards, the Italians, and
the inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People are seldom
guilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects the character
of liberality and good fellowship by being profuse of a liquor which is as
cheap as small beer. On the contrary, in the countries which, either from
excessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where wine consequently
is dear and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as among the north-
ern nations, and all those who live between the tropics, the negroes, for
example, on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment comes from
someofthenorthernprovincesofFrance,wherewineissomewhatdear,to
be quartered in the southern, where it is very cheap, the soldiers, I have
frequently heard it observed are at first debauched by the cheapness and
novelty of good wine; but after a few months’ residence, the greater part
of them become as sober as the rest of the inhabitants. Were the duties
upon foreign wines, and the excises upon malt, beer, and ale to be taken
away all at once, it might, in the same manner, occasion in Great Britain
apretty general andtemporarydrunkennessamongthe middlingandin-
feriorranksofpeople,whichwouldprobablybesoonfollowedbyaperman-
entandalmostuniversalsobriety. Atpresentdrunkennessisbynomeans G.ed.p493
the vice of people of fashion, or of those who can easily afford the most
expensive liquors. A gentleman drunk with ale has scarce ever been seen
among us. The restraints upon the wine trade in Great Britain, besides,
do not so much seem calculated to hinder the people from going, if I may
say so, to the alehouse, as from going where they can buy the best and
cheapest liquor. They favour the wine trade of Portugal, and discourage
379 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
that of France. The Portugese, it is said, indeed, are better customers for
our manufactures than the French, and should therefore be encouraged
in preference to them. As they give us their custom, it is pretended, we
shouldgivethemours. Thesneakingartsofunderlingtradesmenarethus

1057 [9] Bysuchmaximsasthese,however,nationshavebeentaughtthattheir

made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations
withwhichittrades,andtoconsidertheirgainasitsownloss. Commerce,
whichoughtnaturallytobe,amongnations,asamongindividuals,abond

animosity. The capricious ambition of kings and ministers has not, dur-
ing the present and the preceding century, been more fatal to the repose
of Europe than the impertinent jealousy of merchants and manufactur-
ers. Theviolenceandinjusticeoftherulersofmankindisanancientevil,
for which, I am afraid, the nature of human affairs can scarce admit of a
remedy. But the mean rapacity, the monopolizing spirit of merchants and
manufacturers, who neither are, nor ought to be, the rulers of mankind,
though it cannot perhaps be corrected may very easily be prevented from
disturbingthetranquillityofanybodybutthemselves.
1058 [10] That it was the spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and
propagated this doctrine cannot be doubted; and they who first taught it
were by no means such fools as they who believed it. In every country it
always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy
whatevertheywantofthosewhosellitcheapest. Thepropositionissovery

1059 [11] The wealth of a neighbouring nation, however, though dangerous in
war and politics, is certainly advantageous in trade. In a state of hostil-
380 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ity it may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to
our own; but in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable
themtoexchangewithustoagreatervalue,andtoaffordabettermarket,
either for the immediate produce of our own industry, or for whatever is
purchased with that produce. As a rich man is likely to be a better cus-
tomer to the industrious people in his neighbourhood than a poor, so is
likewisearichnation. Arichman,indeed,whoishimselfamanufacturer,
is a very dangerous neighbour to all those who deal in the same way. All
therestoftheneighbourhood, however, byfarthegreatestnumber, profit
by the good market which his expense affords them. They even profit by
hisundersellingthepoorerworkmenwhodealinthesamewaywithhim.
The manufacturers of a rich nation, in the same manner, may no doubt
be very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbours. This very competi-
tion, however, is advantageous to the great body of the people, who profit
greatly besides by the good market which the great expense of such a na-
tion affords them in every other way. Private people who want to make
a fortune never think of retiring to the remote and poor provinces of the
country,butresorteithertothecapital,ortosomeofthegreatcommercial
towns. They know that where little wealth circulates there is little to be
got, but that where a great deal is in motion, some share of it may fall to
them. The same maxims which would in this manner direct the common
sense of one, or ten, or twenty individuals, should regulate the judgment
of one, or ten, or twenty millions, and should make a wholenation regard
the riches of its neighbours as a probable cause and occasion for itself to G.ed.p495
acquire riches. A nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade is cer-
tainly most likely to do so when its neighbours are all rich, industrious,
and commercial nations. A great nation surrounded on all sides by wan-
deringsavagesandpoorbarbariansmight,nodoubt,acquirerichesbythe
cultivation of its own lands, and by its own interior commerce, but not
by foreign trade. It seems to have been in this manner that the ancient
Egyptians and the modern Chinese acquired their great wealth. The an-
cient Egyptians, it is said, neglected foreign commerce, and the modern
Chinese, it is known, bold it in the utmost contempt, and scarce deign to
afford it the decent protection of the laws. The modern maxims of foreign
commerce, by aiming at the impoverishment of all our neighbours, so far
astheyarecapableofproducingtheirintendedeffect,tendtorenderthat
verycommerceinsignificantandcontemptible.
1060 [12] ItisinconsequenceofthesemaximsthatthecommercebetweenFrance

therefore, employed in this trade could in each of the two countries keep
in motion four, five, or six times the quantity of industry, and afford em-
ployment and subsistence to four, five, or six times the number of people,
whichanequalcapitalcoulddointhegreaterpartoftheotherbranchesof

fromoneanother,thereturnsmightbeexpected,atleast,onceintheyear,
and even this trade would so far be at least equally advantageous as the
greaterpartoftheotherbranchesofourforeignEuropeantrade. Itwould
be, at least, three times more advantageous than the boasted trade with
our North American colonies, in which the returns were seldom made in
lessthanthreeyears,frequentlynotinlessthanfourorfiveyears. France,
besides, is supposed to contain twenty-four millions of inhabitants. Our
NorthAmericancolonieswereneversupposedtocontainmorethanthree G.ed.p496

onaccountofthemoreunequaldistributionofriches, thereismuchmore

fore,couldaffordamarketatleasteighttimesmoreextensive,and,onac-
countofthesuperiorfrequencyofthereturns,four-and-twentytimesmore
advantageousthanthatwhichourNorthAmericancolonieseverafforded.
The trade of Great Britain would be just as advantageous to France, and,
in proportion to the wealth, population, and proximity of the respective
countries,wouldhavethesamesuperiorityoverthatwhichFrancecarries
on with her own colonies. Such is the very great difference between that
trade,whichthewisdomofbothnationshasthoughtpropertodiscourage,
andthatwhichithasfavouredthemost.
1061 [13] But the very same circumstances which would have rendered an open
and free commerce between the two countries so advantageous to both,
haveoccasionedtheprincipalobstructionstothatcommerce. Beingneigh-
bours,theyarenecessarilyenemies,andthewealthandpowerofeachbe-
comes, upon that account, more formidable to the other; and what would
increase the advantage of national friendship serves only to inflame the
violenceofnationalanimosity. Theyarebothrichandindustriousnations;
andthemerchantsandmanufacturersofeachdreadthecompetitionofthe

andthetradersofbothcountrieshaveannounced,withallthepassionate
confidenceofinterestedfalsehood,thecertainruinofeach,inconsequence
of that unfavourable balance of trade, which, they pretend, would be the
infallibleeffectofanunrestrainedcommercewiththeother.
1062 [14] There is no commercial country in Europe of which the approaching
ruinhasnotfrequentlybeenforetoldbythepretendeddoctorsofthissys-
temfromanunfavourablebalanceoftrade. Afteralltheanxiety,however,
whichtheyhaveexcitedaboutthis,afterallthevainattemptsofalmostall
382 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tradingnationstoturnthatbalanceintheirownfavourandagainsttheir
neighbours, it does not appear that any one nation in Europe has been in G.ed.p497
any respect impoverished by this cause. Every town and country, on the
contrary, in proportion as they have opened their ports to all nations, in-
steadofbeingruinedbythisfreetrade,astheprinciplesofthecommercial

Holland,itisacknowledged,notonlyderivesitswholewealth,butagreat

1063 [15] There is another balance, indeed, which has already been explained,
very different from the balance of trade, and which, according as it hap-
pens to be either favourable or unfavourable, necessarily occasions the
prosperityordecayofeverynation. Thisisthebalanceoftheannualpro-
duce and consumption. If the exchangeable value of the annual produce,
ithasalreadybeenobserved,exceedsthatoftheannualconsumption,the
capital of the society must annually increase in proportion to this excess.
The society in this case lives within its revenue, and what is annually
savedoutofitsrevenueisnaturallyaddedtoitscapital,andemployedso
as to increase still further the annual produce. If the exchangeable value
of the annual produce, on the contrary, fail short of the annual consump-
tion, the capital of the society must annually decay in proportion to this
deficiency. Theexpenseofthesocietyinthiscaseexceedsitsrevenue,and
necessarilyencroachesuponitscapital. Itscapital,therefore,mustneces-
sarily decay, and together with it the exchangeable value of the annual
produceofitsindustry.
1064 [16] This balance of produce and consumption is entirely different from
what is called the balance of trade. It might take place in a nation which

G.ed.p499
OF DRAWBACKS
1066 [1] MERCHANTS and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of
the home market, but desire likewise the most extensive foreign sale for
theirgoods. Theircountryhasnojurisdictioninforeignnations,andthere-
fore can seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally
obliged, therefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain en-
couragementstoexportation.
1067 [2] Of these encouragements what are called Drawbacks seem to be the
most reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation,
either the whole or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed
upon domestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater
quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been
imposed. Suchencouragementsdonottendtoturntowardsanyparticular
employmentagreatershareofthecapitalofthecountrythanwhatwould
gotothatemploymentofitsownaccord, butonlytohinderthedutyfrom
driving away any part of that share to other employments. They tend not
to overturn that balance which naturally establishes itself among all the
variousemploymentsofthesociety;buttohinderitfrombeingoverturned
by the duty. They tend not to destroy, but to preserve what it is in most
cases advantageous to preserve, the natural division and distribution of
labourinthesociety.
1068 [3] The same thing may be said of the drawbacks upon the re-exportation
of foreign goods imported, which in Great Britain generally amount to by
much the largest part of the duty upon importation. By the second of
the rules annexed to the Act of Parliament which imposed what is now
called the Old Subsidy, every merchant, whether English or alien, was
allowed to draw back half that duty upon exportation; the English mer-
chant,providedtheexportationtookplacewithintwelvemonths;thealien,
provided it took place within nine months. Wines, currants, and wrought
silks were the only goods which did not fall within this rule, having other
and more advantageous allowances. The duties imposed by this Act of
Parliament were at that time the only duties upon the importation of for-
eign goods. The term within which this and all other drawbacks could be
claimed was afterwards (by the 7 Geo. I. chap. 21. sect. 10.) extended to G.ed.p500
threeyears. TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1069 [4] The duties which have been imposed since the Old Subsidy are, the
greater part of them, wholly drawn back upon exportation. This general
rule,however,isliabletoagreatnumberofexceptions,andthedoctrineof
drawbackshasbecomeamuchlesssimplematterthanitwasattheirfirst
institution.
1070 [5] Upon the exportation of some foreign goods, of which it was expected
that the importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the
home consumption, the whole duties are drawn back, without retaining
evenhalftheOldSubsidy. BeforetherevoltofourNorthAmericancolon-
ies, we had the monopoly of the tobacco of Maryland and Virginia. We
imported about ninety-six thousand hogsheads, and the home consump-
tionwasnotsupposedtoexceedfourteenthousand. Tofacilitatethegreat
exportation which was necessary, in order to rid us of the rest, the whole
duties were drawn back, provided the exportation took place within three
years.
1071 [6] We still have, though not altogether, yet very nearly, the monopoly of
thesugarsofourWestIndianIslands. Ifsugarsareexportedwithinayear,
therefore,allthedutiesuponimportationaredrawnback,andifexported
within three years all the duties, except half the Old Subsidy, which still
continuestoberetainedupontheexportationofthegreaterpartofgoods.
Though the importation of sugar exceeds, a good deal, what is necessary
for the home consumption, the excess is inconsiderable in comparison of
whatitusedtobeintobacco.
1072 [7] Somegoods, theparticularobjectsofthejealousyofourownmanufac-
turers, are prohibited to be imported for home consumption. They may,
however, upon paying certain duties, be imported and warehoused for ex-
portation. But upon such exportation, no part of these duties are drawn
back. Ourmanufacturersareunwilling,itseems,thateventhisrestricted
importation should be encouraged, and are afraid lest some part of these
goods should be stolen out of the warehouse, and thus come into compet-
ition with their own. It is under these regulations only that we can im-
port wrought silks, French cambrics and lawns, calicoes painted, printed,
stainedordyed,etc.
1073 [8] We are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose
rather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those, whom we con-
sider as our enemies, to make any profit by our means. Not only half the
old subsidy, but the second twenty-five per cent, is retained upon the ex- G.ed.p501
portationofallFrenchgoods.
1074 [9] By the fourth of the rules annexed to the Old Subsidy, the drawback
allowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more
thanhalfthedutieswhichwere,atthattime,paidupontheirimportation;
and it seems, at that time, to have been the object of the legislature to
give somewhat more than ordinary encouragement to the carrying trade
inwine. Severaloftheotherdutiestoo, whichwereimposedeitheratthe

1692,beingpaiddowninreadymoney,uponimportation,theinterestofso
largeasumoccasionedanexpense,whichmadeitunreasonabletoexpect
any profitable carrying trade in this article. Only a part, therefore, of the
duty called the impost on wine, and no part of the twenty-five pounds the
ton upon French wines, or of the duties imposed in 1745, in 1763, and in G.ed.p502
1778, were allowed to be drawn back upon exportation. The two imposts
of five per cent, imposed in 1779 and 1781, upon all the former duties of
customs, being allowed to be wholly drawn back upon the exportation of
allothergoods,werelikewiseallowedtobedrawnbackuponthatofwine.
Thelastdutythathasbeenparticularlyimposeduponwine,thatof1780,

heavydutiesareretained,mostprobablycouldneveroccasiontheexporta-
tionofasingletonofwine. Theserulestakeplacewithregardtoallplaces
oflawfulexportation,excepttheBritishcoloniesinAmerica.
1075 [10] The 15th Charles II. chap. 7. called an act for the encouragement of
trade, had given Great Britain the monopoly of supplying the colonies
with all the commodities of the growth or manufacture of Europe; and
consequentlywithwines. InacountryofsoextensiveacoastasourNorth
American and West Indian colonies, where our authority was always so
very slender, and where the inhabitants were allowed to carry out, in
their own ships, their non-enumerated commodities, at first to all parts
ofEurope, andafterwardstoallpartsofEuropesouthofCapeFinisterre,
it is not very probable that this monopoly could ever be much respected;
and they probably, at all times, found means of bringing back some cargo
fromthecountriestowhichtheywereallowedtocarryoutone. Theyseem,
however, to have found some difficulty in importing European wines from
theplacesoftheirgrowth,andtheycouldnotwellimportthemfromGreat
Britain where they were loaded with many heavy duties, of which a con-
siderable part was not drawn back upon exportation. Maderia wine, not
beingaEuropeancommodity,couldbeimporteddirectlyintoAmericaand
the West Indies, countries which, in all their non-enumerated commodit-
ies, enjoyed a free trade to the island of Maderia. These circumstances
had probably introduced that general taste for Maderia wine, which our
officers found established in all our colonies at the commencement of the
war, which began in 1755, and which they brought back with them to the G.ed.p503
mother country, where that wine had not been much in fashion before.
Upon the conclusion of that war, in 1763 (by the 4th Geo. III. chap. 15.
sect. 12.), all the duties, except 3l.10s. were allowed to be drawn back
upon the exportation to the colonies of all wines, except French wines, to
the commerce and consumption of which national prejudice would allow
no sort of encouragement. The period between the granting of this indul-
387 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
genceandtherevoltofourNorthAmericancolonieswasprobablytooshort
toadmitofanyconsiderablechangeinthecustomsofthosecountries.
1076 [11] The same act, which, in the drawback upon all wines, except French
wines, thus favoured the colonies so much more than other countries; in
thoseuponthegreaterpartofothercommoditiesfavouredthemmuchless.
Upontheexportationofthegreaterpartofcommoditiestoothercountries,

that duty should be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of
any commodities, of the growth or manufacture either of Europe or the
EastIndies,exceptwines,whitecalicoes,andmuslins.
1077 [12] Drawbackswere,perhaps,originallygrantedfortheencouragementof
the carrying trade, which, as the freight of the ships is frequently paid
by foreigners in money, was supposed to be peculiarly fitted for bringing
gold and silver into the country. But though the carrying trade certainly
deserves no peculiar encouragement, though the motive of the institution
was perhaps abundantly foolish, the institution itself seems reasonable
enough. Such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater share of
the capital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own ac-
cord had there been no duties upon importation. They only prevent its
being excluded altogether by those duties. The carrying trade, though it
deserves no preference, ought not to be precluded, but to be left free like
allothertrades. Itisanecessaryresourceforthosecapitalswhichcannot
find employment either in the agriculture or in the manufactures of the
country,eitherinitshometradeorinitsforeigntradeofconsumption.
1078 [13] The revenue of the customs, instead of suffering, profits from such
drawbacks by that part of the duty which is retained. If the whole du-
ties had been retained, the foreign goods upon which they are paid could
seldomhavebeenexported,norconsequentlyimported,forwantofamar-
ket. The duties, therefore, of which a part is retained would never have
beenpaid.
1079 [14] These reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks, and would jus-
tifythem,thoughthewholeduties,whetherupontheproduceofdomestic
industry,oruponforeigngoods,werealwaysdrawnbackuponexportation. G.ed.p504
The revenue of excise would in this case, indeed, suffer a little, and that
of the customs a good deal more; but the natural balance of industry, the
natural division and distribution of labour, which is always more or less
disturbed by such duties, would be more nearly re-established by such a
regulation.
1080 [15] These reasons, however, will justify drawbacks only upon exporting
goods to those countries which are altogether foreign and independent,
not to those in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a mono-
poly. A drawback, for example, upon the exportation of European goods
to our American colonies will not always occasion a greater exportation
than what would have taken place without it. By means of the monopoly
which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy there, the same quantity
388 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
might frequently, perhaps, be sent thither, though the whole duties were
retained. The drawback, therefore, may frequently be pure loss to the
revenue of excise and customs, without altering the state of the trade, or
rendering it in any respect more extensive. How far such drawbacks can
be justified, as a proper encouragement to the industry of our colonies, or
how far it is advantageous to the mother country, that they should be ex-
empted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their fellow subjects,
willappearhereafterwhenIcometotreatthecolonies.
1081 [16] Drawbacks, however, it must always be understood, are useful only
in those cases in which the goods for the exportation of which they are
given are really exported to some foreign country; and not clandestinely
re-imported into our own. That some drawbacks, particularly those upon
tobacco, have frequently been abused in this manner, and have given oc-
casion to many frauds equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair
trader,iswellknown.
389 CHAPTER V
G.ed.p505
OF BOUNTIES
1082 [1] BOUNTIES upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently petitioned
for, and sometimes granted to the produce of particular branches of do-
mestic industry. By means of them our merchants and manufacturers, it
is pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap, or cheaper than
their rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is said, will thus
beexported, and the balanceoftradeconsequently turned moreinfavour
ofourowncountry. Wecannotgiveourworkmenamonopolyintheforeign
as we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to buy
their goods as we have done our own countrymen. The next best expedi-
ent, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this
manner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole country,
andtoputmoneyintoallourpocketsbymeansofthebalanceoftrade.
1083 [2] Bounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of trade
only which cannot be carried on without them. But every branch of trade
inwhichthemerchantcansellhisgoodsforapricewhichreplacestohim,
withtheordinaryprofitsofstock,thewholecapitalemployedinpreparing
and sending them to market, can be carried on without a bounty. Every
such branch is evidently upon a level with all the other branches of trade
which are carried on without bounties, and cannot therefore require one
morethanthey. Thosetradesonlyrequirebountiesinwhichthemerchant

1085 [4] The ingenious and well-informed author of the tracts upon the corn
trade has shown very clearly that, since the bounty upon the exportation
of corn was first established, the price of the corn exported, valued mod-
eratelyenough, hasexceededthatofthecornimported, valuedveryhigh,
byamuchgreatersumthantheamountofthewholebountieswhichhave
been paid during that period. This, he imagines, upon the true principles
of the mercantile system, is a clear proof that this forced corn trade is be-
neficial to the nation; the value of the exportation exceeding that of the
importationbyamuchgreatersumthanthewholeextraordinaryexpense
which the public has been at in order to get it exported. He does not con-

this.
1086 [5] Theaveragepriceofcorn,ithasbeensaid,hasfallenconsiderablysince
the establishment of the bounty. That the average price of corn began to
fall somewhat towards the end of the last century, and has continued to
do so during the course of the sixty-four first years of the present, I have
alreadyendeavouredtoshow. Butthisevent,supposingittobeasrealas G.ed.p507
I believe it to be, must have happened in spite of the bounty, and cannot
possibly have happened in consequence of it. It has happened in France,
aswellasinEngland,thoughinFrancetherewasnotonlynobounty,but,
till 1764, the exportation of corn was subjected to a general prohibition.
This gradual fall in the average price of grain, it is probable, therefore,
is ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the other. but to
that gradual and insensible rise in the real value of silver, which, in the
firstbookinthisdiscourse,Ihaveendeavouredtoshowhastakenplacein
the general market of Europe during the course of the present century. It
seemstobealtogetherimpossiblethatthebountycouldevercontributeto
lowerthepriceofgrain.
1087 [6] Inyearsofplenty,ithasalreadybeenobserved,thebounty,byoccasion-
inganextraordinaryexportation,necessarilykeepsupthepriceofcornin
the home market above what it would naturally fall to. To do so was the
avowed purpose of the institution. In years of scarcity, though the bounty
391 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is frequently suspended, yet the great exportation which it occasions in
yearsofplentymustfrequentlyhindermoreorlesstheplentyofoneyear
fromrelievingthescarcityofanother. Bothinyearsofplentyandinyears
ofscarcity,therefore,thebountynecessarilytendstoraisethemoneyprice
ofcornsomewhathigherthanitotherwisewouldbeinthehomemarket.
1088 [7] That, in the actual state of tillage, the bounty must necessarily have
this tendency will not, I apprehend, be disputed by any reasonable per-
son. But it has been thought by many people that it tends to encourage
tillage, and that in two different ways; first, by opening a more extensive
foreignmarkettothecornofthefarmer,ittends,theyimagine,toincrease
the demand for, and consequently the production of that commodity; and
secondly,bysecuringtohimabetterpricethanhecouldotherwiseexpect
in the actual state of tillage, it tends, they suppose, to encourage tillage.
This double encouragement must, they imagine, in a long period of years,
occasion such an increase in the production of corn as may lower its price G.ed.p508
inthehomemarketmuchmorethanthebountycanraiseit,intheactual
statewhichtillagemay,attheendofthatperiod,happentobein.
1089 [8] I answer, that whatever extension of the foreign market can be occa-
sioned by the bounty must, in every particular year, be altogether at the
expense of the home market; as every bushel of corn which is exported
bymeansofthebounty, andwhichwouldnothavebeenexportedwithout
thebounty,wouldhaveremainedinthehomemarkettoincreasethecon-
sumption and to lower the price of that commodity. The corn bounty, it is
to be observed, as well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes
twodifferenttaxesuponthepeople;first,thetaxwhichtheyareobligedto
contribute in order to pay the bounty; and secondly, the tax which arises
fromtheadvancedpriceofthecommodityinthehomemarket,andwhich,
asthewholebodyofthepeoplearepurchasersofcorn,must,inthispartic-
ularcommodity,bepaidbythewholebodyofthepeople. Inthisparticular
commodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the heavier of the two.
Letussupposethat,takingoneyearwithanother,thebountyoffiveshil-
lings upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat raises the price of that
commodityinthehomemarketonlysixpencethebushel, orfourshillings
the quarter, higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state
of the crop. Even upon this very moderate supposition, the great body of
the people, over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of
five shillings upon every quarter of wheat exported, must pay another of
fourshillingsuponeveryquarterwhichtheythemselvesconsume. But,ac-
cordingtotheverywellinformedauthorofthetractsuponthecorntrade,
the average proportion of the corn exported to that consumed at home is

So far as it operates in the one way, it must reduce the ability of the la-

occasionedbythebounty,notonly,ineveryparticularyear,diminishesthe
home, just as much as it extends the foreign, market and consumption,
but, by restraining the population and industry of the country, its final
tendency is to stunt and restrain the gradual extension of the home mar-
ket;andthereby,inthelongrun,rathertodiminish,thantoaugment,the
wholemarketandconsumptionofcorn.
1090 [9] This enhancement of the money price of corn, however, it has been
thought,byrenderingthatcommoditymoreprofitabletothefarmer,must
necessarilyencourageitsproduction.
1091 [10] I answer, that this might be the case if the effect of the bounty was to
raise the real price of corn, or to enable the farmer, with an equal quant-
ity of it, to maintain a greater number of labourers in the same manner,
whether liberal, moderate, or scanty, that other labourers are commonly
maintained in his neighbourhood. But neither the bounty, it is evident,
nor any other human institution can have any such effect. It is not the
real, but the nominal price of corn, which can in any considerable degree
be affected by the bounty. And though the tax which that institution im-
posesuponthewholebodyofthepeoplemaybeveryburdensometothose
whopayit,itisofverylittleadvantagetothosewhoreceiveit.
1092 [11] The real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value of
corn as to degrade the real value of silver, or to make an equal quantity
of it exchange for a smaller quantity, not only of corn, but of all other
homemade commodities: for the money price of corn regulates that of all
otherhome-madecommodities.
1093 [12] Itregulatesthemoneypriceoflabour,whichmustalwaysbesuchasto

him and his family either in the liberal, moderate, or scanty manner in
which the advancing, stationary, or declining circumstances of the society

1094 [13] It regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce
of land, which, in every period of improvement, must bear a certain pro-
portion to that of corn, though this proportion is different in different
periods. It regulates, for example, the money price of grass and hay, of
butcher’smeat, ofhorses, andthemaintenanceofhorses, oflandcarriage
consequently,orofthegreaterpartoftheinlandcommerceofthecountry.

manufacture. The money price of labour, and of everything that is the
produce either of land or labour, must necessarily either rise or fall in
proportiontothemoneypriceofcorn.
1096 [15] Though in consequence of the bounty, therefore, the farmer should be
enabled to sell his corn for four shillings a bushel instead of three-and-
sixpence, and to pay his landlord a money rent proportionable to this rise

1099 [18] It is the peculiar situation of Spain and Portugal as proprietors of the
mines to be the distributors of gold and silver to all the other countries of
Europe. Thosemetalsoughtnaturally, therefore, tobesomewhatcheaper
in Spain and Portugal than in any other part of Europe. The difference, G.ed.p511
however,shouldbenomorethantheamountofthefreightandinsurance;
and, on account of the great value and small bulk of those metals, their
freight is no great matter, and their insurance is the same as that of any
othergoodsofequalvalue. SpainandPortugal,therefore,couldsuffervery
littlefromtheirpeculiarsituation,iftheydidnotaggravateitsdisadvant-

the value of those metals in other countries so much more above what it
is in their own by the whole amount of this expense. When you dam up a
stream of water, as soon as the dam is full as much water must run over
thedam-headasiftherewasnodamatall. Theprohibitionofexportation
cannot detain a greater quantity of gold and silver in Spain and Portugal
than what they can afford to employ, than what the annual produce of
theirlandandlabourwillallowthemtoemploy,incoin,plate,gilding,and
other ornaments of gold and silver. When they have got this quantity the

TheannualexportationofgoldandsilverfromSpainandPortugalaccord-
inglyis,byallaccounts,notwithstandingtheserestraints,verynearequal
to the whole annual importation. As the water, however, must always be
deeper behind the dam-head than before it, so the quantity of gold and
silver which these restraints detain in Spain and Portugal must, in pro-
portion to the annual produce of their land and labour, be greater than
what is to be found in other countries. The higher and stronger the dam-
head,thegreatermustbethedifferenceinthedepthofwaterbehindand

to be very considerable, and that you frequently find there a profusion of
plate in houses where there is nothing else which would, in other coun-
tries, be thought suitable or correspondent to this sort of magnificence.
The cheapness of gold and silver, or what is the same thing, the dear-
ness of all commodities, which is the necessary effect of this redundancy
ofthepreciousmetals,discouragesboththeagricultureandmanufactures
of Spain and Portugal, and enables foreign nations to supply them with
many sorts of rude, and with almost all sorts of manufactured produce,
for a smaller quantity of gold and silver than what they themselves can
either raise or make them for at home. The tax and prohibition operate
in two different ways. They not only lower very much the value of the G.ed.p513
precious metals in Spain and Portugal, but by detaining there a certain
quantityofthosemetalswhichwouldotherwiseflowoverothercountries,
they keep up their value in those other countries somewhat above what
it otherwise would be, and thereby give those countries a double advant-
ageintheircommercewithSpainandPortugal. Opentheflood-gates,and

which Spain and Portugal could sustain by this exportation of their gold

As the nominal value of their goods would fall, the real value of what re-
mainedoftheirgoldandsilverwouldrise,andasmallerquantityofthose
metals would answer all the same purposes of commerce and circulation
which had employed a greater quantity before. The gold and silver which
wouldgoabroadwouldnotgoabroadfornothing,butwouldbringbackan
equal value of goods of some kind or another. Those goods, too, would not
be all matters of mere luxury and expense, to be consumed by idle people
who produce nothing in return for their consumption. As the real wealth
and revenue of idle people would not be augmented by this extraordinary
exportationofgoldandsilver,soneitherwouldtheirconsumptionbemuch
augmented by it. Those goods would, probably, the greater part of them,
andcertainlysomepartofthem,consistinmaterials,tools,andprovisions,

produce, with a profit, the full value of their consumption. A part of the
deadstockofthesocietywouldthusbeturnedintoactivestock,andwould
put into motion a greater quantity of industry than had been employed
before. The annual produce of their land and labour would immediately
be augmented a little, and in a few years would, probably, be augmented
a great deal; their industry being thus relieved from one of the most op-
pressiveburdenswhichitatpresentlaboursunder.
1101 [20] The bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates exactly
inthesamewayasthisabsurdpolicyofSpainandPortugal. Whateverbe G.ed.p514

without rendering any considerable service either to our farmers or coun-
trygentlemen. Itputs,indeed,alittlemoremoneyintothepocketsofboth,
and it will perhaps be somewhat difficult to persuade the greater part of
them that this is not rendering them a very considerable service. But if
this money sinks in its value, in the quantity of labour, provisions, and
homemade commodities of all different kinds which it is capable of pur-
chasing as much as it rises in its quantity, the service will be little more
thannominalandimaginary.
1103 [22] There is, perhaps, but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to
whom the bounty either was or could be essentially serviceable. These
werethecornmerchants, theexportersandimportersofcorn. Inyearsof
plentythebountynecessarilyoccasionedagreaterexportationthanwould
otherwise have taken place; and by hindering the plenty of one year from
relievingthescarcityofanother,itoccasionedinyearsofscarcityagreater

andconsequentlywithagreaterprofitthanhecouldotherwisehavemade,
iftheplentyofoneyearhadnotbeenmoreorlesshinderedfromrelieving G.ed.p515
the scarcity of another. It is in this set of men, accordingly, that I have
observedthegreatestzealforthecontinuanceorrenewalofthebounty.
1104 [23] Our country gentlemen, when they imposed the high duties upon the
importationofforeigncorn,whichintimesofmoderateplentyamounttoa
prohibition, andwhentheyestablishedthebounty, seemtohaveimitated
the conduct of our manufacturers. By the one institution, they secured to
themselves the monopoly of the home market, and by the other they en-
deavoured to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with their
commodity. By both they endeavoured to raise its real value, in the same
mannerasourmanufacturershad,bythelikeinstitutions,raisedthereal
valueofmanydifferentsortsofmanufacturedgoods. Theydidnotperhaps
attend to the great and essential difference which nature has established
between corn and almost every other sort of goods. When, either by the
monopoly of the home market, or by a bounty upon exportation, you en-
able our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their goods for somewhat
a better price than they otherwise could get for them, you raise, not only
thenominal,buttherealpriceofthosegoods. Yourenderthemequivalent
to a greater quantity of labour and subsistence, you increase not only the
nominal,buttherealprofit,therealwealthandrevenueofthosemanufac-
turers,andyouenablethemeithertolivebetterthemselves,ortoemploy
a greater quantity of labour in those particular manufactures. You really
encourage those manufactures, and direct towards them a greater quant-
ity of the industry of the country than what would probably go to them of
itsownaccord. Butwhenbythelikeinstitutionsyouraisethenominalor
money-priceofcorn,youdonotraiseitsrealvalue. Youdonotincreasethe
397 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

You do not encourage the growth of corn because you do not enable them
tomaintainandemploymorelabourersinraisingit. Thenatureofthings
hasstampeduponcornarealvaluewhichcannotbealteredbymerelyal-
tering its money price. No bounty upon exportation, no monopoly of the G.ed.p516
home market, can raise that value. The freest competition cannot lower
it. Through the world in general that value is equal to the quantity of la-
bourwhichitcanmaintain,andineveryparticularplaceitisequaltothe

erate, or scanty, in which labour is commonly maintained in that place.
Woollen or linen cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the
realvalueofallothercommoditiesmustbefinallymeasuredanddeterm-
ined; cornis. Therealvalueofeveryothercommodityisfinallymeasured
and determined by the proportion which its average money price bears to
theaveragemoneypriceofcorn. Therealvalueofcorndoesnotvarywith
those variations in its average money price, which sometimes occur from
one century to another. It is the real value of silver which varies with
them.
1105 [24] Bountiesupontheexportationofanyhomemadecommodityareliable,
first to that general objection which may be made to all the different ex-
pedients of the mercantile system; the objection of forcing some part of
the industry of the country into a channel less advantageous than that in
whichitwouldrunofitsownaccord: and,secondly,totheparticularobjec-
tionofforcingit,notonlyintoachannelthatislessadvantageous,butinto
onethatisactuallydisadvantageous;thetradewhichcannotbecarriedon
but by means of a bounty being necessarily a losing trade. The bounty
upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection, that it can
in no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity of which
it was meant to encourage the production. When our country gentlemen,
therefore,demandedtheestablishmentofthebounty,thoughtheyactedin
imitationofourmerchantsandmanufacturers, theydidnotactwiththat
completecomprehensionoftheirowninterestwhichcommonlydirectsthe

of their own lands, which necessarily depends upon the general industry
ofthecountry.
1106 [25] To encourage the production of any commodity, a bounty upon produc-
tion, one should imagine, would have a more direct operation than one
upon exportation. It would, besides, impose only one tax upon the people,
that which they must contribute in order to pay the bounty. Instead of
raising, it would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home
398 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
market; and thereby, instead of imposing a second tax upon the people,
it might, at least, in part, repay them for what they had contributed to
thefirst. Bountiesuponproduction, however, havebeenveryrarelygran-
ted. The prejudices established by the commercial system have taught
us to believe that national wealth arises more immediately from exporta-
tion than from production. It has been more favoured accordingly, as the
moreimmediatemeansofbringingmoneyintothecountry. Bountiesupon
production, it has been said too, have been found by experience more li-
able to frauds than those upon exportation. How far this is true, I know
not. Thatbountiesuponexportationhavebeenabusedtomanyfraudulent
purposes is very well known. But it is not the interest of merchants and
manufacturers, the great inventors of all these expedients, that the home
market should be overstocked with their goods, an event which a bounty
uponproductionmightsometimesoccasion. Abountyuponexportation,by
enablingthemtosendabroadthesurpluspart,andtokeepupthepriceof
whatremainsinthehomemarket,effectuallypreventsthis. Ofalltheex-
pedients of the mercantile system, accordingly, it is the one of which they
arethefondest. Ihaveknownthedifferentundertakersofsomeparticular
worksagreeprivatelyamongthemselvestogiveabountyoutoftheirown
pockets upon the exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which
they dealt in. This expedient succeeded so well that it more than doubled
the price of their goods in the home market, notwithstanding a very con-
siderable increase in the produce. The operation of the bounty upon corn
must have been wonderfully different if it has lowered the money price of
thatcommodity.
1107 [26] Something like a bounty upon production, however, has been granted G.ed.p518
uponsomeparticularoccasions. Thetonnagebountiesgiventothewhite-
herring and whale fisheries may, perhaps, be considered as somewhat of
this nature. They tend directly, it may be supposed, to render the goods
cheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be. In other re-
spects their effects, it must be acknowledged, are the same as those of
bounties upon exportation. By means of them a part of the capital of the
country is employed in bringing goods to market, of which the price does
notrepaythecosttogetherwiththeordinaryprofitsofstock.

1109 [28] Notwithstanding these favourable allegations, however, the following
considerationsdisposemetobelievethat,ingrantingatleastoneofthese

sarytorepackthemwithanadditionalquantityofsalt;andinthiscase,it

[31] The salt with which these herrings are cured is sometimes Scotch and
1112
sometimes foreign salt, both which are delivered free of all excise duty to
thefish-curers. TheexcisedutyuponScotchsaltisatpresent1s.6d.,that

whethertheherringswerecuredwithforeignorwithScotchsalt,onlyone
shilling the barrel is paid up. It was the old Scotch duty upon a bushel of
salt,thequantitywhich,atalowestimation,hadbeensupposednecessary
for curing a barrel of herrings. In Scotland, foreign salt is very little used
for any other purpose but the curing of fish. But from the 5th April 1771
to the 5th April 1782, the quantity of foreign salt imported amounted to
936,974 bushels, at eighty-four pounds the bushel: the quantity of Scotch
salt, delivered from the works to the fish-curers, to no more than 168,226,
at fifty-six pounds the bushel only. It would appear, therefore, that it is
principally foreign salt that is used in the fisheries. Upon every barrel G.ed.p520
of herrings exported there is, besides, a bounty of 2s.8d., and more than
two-thirds of the buss caught herrings are exported. Put all these things
together and you will find that, during these eleven years, every barrel
of buss caught herrings, cured with Scotch salt when exported, has cost

The price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen
and eighteen to four and five and twenty shillings, about a guinea at an
average1.
1113 [32] Secondly, the bounty to the white-herring fishery is a tonnage bounty;
andisproportionedtotheburdenoftheship,nottoherdiligenceorsuccess
in the fishery; and it has, I am afraid, been too common for vessels to fit
out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty. In the
1[Smith]Seetheaccountsoftheendofthevolume.

year 1759, when the bounty was at fifty shillings the ton, the whole buss
fishery of Scotland brought in only four barrels of sea-sticks. In that year

[33] Thirdly,themodeoffishingforwhichthistonnagebountyinthewhite-

herringfisheryhasbeengiven(bybussesordeckedvesselsfromtwentyto
eightytonsburthen),seemsnotsowelladaptedtothesituationofScotland
astothatofHolland,fromthepracticeofwhichcountryitappearstohave
been borrowed. Holland lies at a great distance from the seas to which
herringsareknownprincipallytoresort,andcan,therefore,carryonthat
fishery only in decked vessels, which can carry water and provisions suf-
ficient for a voyage to a distant sea. But the Hebrides or western islands,
theislandsofShetland,andthenorthernandnorthwesterncoastsofScot-
land, the countries in whose neighbourhood the herring fishery is prin-
cipally carried on, are everywhere intersected by arms of the sea, which
run up a considerable way into the land, and which, in the language of
the country, are called sea-lochs. It is to these sea-lochs that the herrings G.ed.p521
principallyresortduringtheseasonsinwhichtheyvisitthoseseas;forthe
visits of this and, I am assured, of many other sorts of fish are not quite
regular and constant. A boat fishery, therefore, seems to be the mode of
fishing best adapted to the peculiar situation of Scotland, the fishers car-
rying the herrings on shore, as fast as they are taken, to be either cured
orconsumedfresh. Butthegreatencouragementwhichabountyofthirty
shillings the ton gives to the buss fishery is necessarily a discouragement
to the boat fishery, which, having no such bounty, cannot bring its cured
fish to market upon the same terms as the buss fishery. The boat fishery,
accordingly, which before the establishment of the buss bounty was very
considerable, and is said have employed a number of seamen not inferior
to what the buss fishery employs at present, is now gone almost entirely
todecay. Oftheformerextent,however,ofthisnowruinedandabandoned
fishery,ImustacknowledgethatIcannotpretendtospeakwithmuchpre-
cision. Asnobountywaspaidupontheoutfitoftheboatfishery,noaccount
wastakenofitbytheofficersofthecustomsorsaltduties.
1115 [34] Fourthly,inmanypartsofScotland,duringcertainseasonsoftheyear,
herrings make no inconsiderable part of the food of the people. A bounty,
which tended to lower their price in the home market, might contribute
a good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellow-subjects, whose
circumstancesarebynomeansaffluent. Buttheherringbussbountycon-
tributes to no such good purpose. It has ruined the boat fishery, which is,
by far, the best adapted for the supply of the home market, and the addi-
tionalbountyof2s.8d.thebarreluponexportationcarriesthegreaterpart,
more than two-thirds, of the produce of the buss fishery abroad. Between
thirty and forty years ago, before the establishment of the buss bounty,
fifteen shillings the barrel, I have been assured, was the common price of
whiteherrings. Betweentenandfifteenyearsago,beforetheboatfishery
401 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
wasentirelyruined,thepriceissaidtohaverunfromseventeentotwenty
shillingsthebarrel. Fortheselastfiveyears,ithas,atanaverage,beenat
twenty-five shillings the barrel. This high price, however, may have been
owing to the real scarcity of the herrings upon the coast of Scotland. I
must observe, too, that the cask or barrel, which is usually sold with the
herrings,andofwhichthepriceisincludedinalltheforegoingprices,has,
since the commencement of the American war, risen to about double its
former price, or from about three shillings to about six shillings. I must
likewise observe that the accounts I have received of the prices of former
times have been by no means quite uniform and consistent; and an old
manofgreataccuracyandexperiencehasassuredmethat,morethanfifty
years ago, a guinea was the usual price of a barrel of good merchantable G.ed.p522
herrings;andthis,Iimagine,maystillbelookeduponastheaverageprice.
All accounts, however, I think, agree that the price has not been lowered
inthehomemarketinconsequenceofthebussbounty.
1116 [35] When the undertakers of fisheries, after such liberal bounties have
beenbestoweduponthem,continuetoselltheircommodityatthesame,or
evenatahigherpricethantheywereaccustomedtodobefore,itmightbe
expected that their profits should be very great; and it is not improbable
that those of some individuals may have been so. In general, however, I
have every reason to believe they have been quite otherwise. The usual
effectofsuchbountiesistoencouragerashundertakerstoadventureina

same annuity, and the same encouragements of all kinds, were given to
the trade of those inferior chambers as to that of the great company. The

Inspiteofalltheseencouragements,almostallthosedifferentcompanies,

itals; scarce a vestige now remains of any of them, and the white-herring
fishery is now entirely, or almost entirely, carried on by private adventur-
ers.
1117 [36] Ifanyparticularmanufacturewasnecessary,indeed,forthedefenceof
thesociety,itmightnotalwaysbeprudenttodependuponourneighbours
for the supply; and if such manufacture could not otherwise be suppor-
ted at home, it might not be unreasonable that all the other branches of G.ed.p523
industry should be taxed in order to support it. The bounties upon the
exportation of British-made sailcloth and British-made gunpowder may,
perhaps,bothbevindicateduponthisprinciple.
1118 [37] Butthoughitcanveryseldombereasonabletotaxtheindustryofthe
greatbodyofthepeopleinordertosupportthatofsomeparticularclassof
manufacturers, yet in the wantonness of great prosperity, when the pub-
lic enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with, to give
such bounties to favourite manufactures may, perhaps, be as natural as
to incur any other idle expense. In public as well as in private expenses,

1119 [38] What is called a bounty is sometimes no more than a drawback, and
consequently is not liable to the same objections as what is properly a
bounty. Thebounty,forexample,uponrefinedsugarexportedmaybecon-

1120 [39] Premiums given by the public to artists and manufacturers who ex-
cel in their particular occupations are not liable to the same objections
as bounties. By encouraging extraordinary dexterity and ingenuity, they
servetokeepuptheemulationoftheworkmenactuallyemployedinthose
respective occupations, and are not considerable enough to turn towards
any one of them a greater share of the capital of the country than what
wouldgotoitofitsownaccord. Theirtendencyisnottooverturnthenat-

sometimes cost the public in one year more than three hundred thousand
pounds.

Digression concerning the Corn Trade and
Corn Laws
[1] I cannot conclude this chapter concerning bounties without observing
1122
thatthepraiseswhichhavebeenbestoweduponthelawwhichestablishes
the bounty upon the exportation of corn, and upon that system of regula-
tions which is connected with it, are altogether unmerited. A particular
examination of the nature of the corn trade, and of the principal British
laws which relate to it. will sufficiently demonstrate the truth of this as-
sertion. Thegreatimportanceofthissubjectmustjustifythelengthofthe
digression.
1123 [2] Thetradeofthecornmerchantiscomposedoffourdifferentbranches,
which, though they may sometimes be all carried on by the same person,
areintheirownnaturefourseparateanddistincttrades. Theseare,first,
thetradeoftheinlanddealer; secondly,thatofthemerchantimporterfor
homeconsumption;thirdly,thatofthemerchantexporterofhomeproduce
for foreign consumption; and, fourthly, that of the merchant carrier, or of
theimporterofcorninordertoexportitagain.
[3] I. The interest of the inland dealer, and that of the great body of the
1124
people, how opposite soever they may at first sight appear, are, even in
years of the greatest scarcity, exactly the same. It is his interest to raise
the price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of the season requires,
and it can never be his interest to raise it higher. By raising the price he
discouragestheconsumption,andputseverybodymoreorless,butpartic-
ularly the inferior ranks of people, upon thrift and good management. If,
by raising it too high, he discourages the consumption so much that the
supply of the season is likely to go beyond the consumption of the season,
and to last for some time after the next crop begins to come in, he runs
the hazard, not only of losing a considerable part of his corn by natural
causes, but of being obliged to sell what remains of it for much less than
whathemighthavehadforitseveralmonthsbefore. Ifbynotraisingthe
pricehighenoughhediscouragestheconsumptionsolittlethatthesupply
of the season is likely to fall short of the consumption of the season, he
not only loses a part of the profit which he might otherwise have made,
but he exposes the people to suffer before the end of the season, instead
of the hardships of a dearth, the dreadful horrors of a famine. It is the
interest of the people that their daily, weekly, and monthly consumption G.ed.p525
should be proportioned as exactly as possible to the supply of the season.
The interest of the inland corn dealer is the same. By supplying them, as
nearly as he can judge, in this proportion, he is likely to sell all his corn
for the highest price, and with the greatest profit; and his knowledge of
the state of the crop, and of his daily, weekly, and monthly sales, enable
him to judge, with more or less accuracy, how far they really are supplied
404 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
in this manner. Without intending the interest of the people, he is neces-
sarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat them, even in years of
scarcity,prettymuchinthesamemannerastheprudentmasterofavessel
is sometimes obliged to treat his crew. When he foresees that provisions
are likely to run short, he puts them upon short allowance. Though from
excess of caution he should sometimes do this without any real necessity,
yetalltheinconvenienceswhichhiscrewcantherebysufferareinconsid-
erable in comparison of the danger, misery, and ruin to which they might
sometimesbeexposedbyalessprovidentconduct. Thoughfromexcessof
avarice, inthesamemanner, theinlandcornmerchantshouldsometimes
raisethepriceofhiscornsomewhathigherthanthescarcityoftheseason
requires, yet all the inconveniences which the people can suffer from this
conduct, which effectually secures them from a famine in the end of the
season, are inconsiderable in comparison of what they might have been
exposed to by a more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it. The
cornmerchanthimselfislikelytosufferthemostbythisexcessofavarice;
not only from the indignation which it generally excites against him, but,
though he should escape the effects of this indignation, from the quantity
ofcornwhichitnecessarilyleavesuponhishandsintheendoftheseason,
andwhich,ifthenextseasonhappenstoprovefavourable,hemustalways

1125 [4] Wereitpossible,indeed,foronegreatcompanyofmerchantstopossess
themselvesofthewholecropofanextensivecountry,itmight,perhaps,be
their interest to deal with it as the Dutch are said to do with the spicer-
ies of the Moluccas, to destroy or throw away a considerable part of it in
order to keep up the price of the rest. But it is scarce possible, even by
the violence of law, to establish such an extensive monopoly with regard
to corn; and, wherever the law leaves the trade free, it is of all commod-
ities the least liable to be engrossed or monopolized by the force of a few
large capitals, which buy up the greater part of it. Not only its value far
exceedswhat thecapitals ofa fewprivate menare capable ofpurchasing,
but,supposingtheywerecapableofpurchasingit,themannerinwhichit
is produced renders this purchase practicable. As in every civilised coun-
try it is the commodity of which the annual consumption is the greatest,
so a greater quantity of industry is annually employed in producing corn G.ed.p526
than in producing any other commodity. When it first comes from the
ground, too, it is necessarily divided among a greater number of owners
than any other commodity; and these owners can never be collected into
oneplacelikeanumberofindependentmanufacturers,butarenecessarily
scatteredthroughallthedifferentcornersofthecountry. Thesefirstown-
erseitherimmediatelysupplytheconsumersintheirownneighbourhood,
or they supply other inland dealers who supply those consumers. The in-
land dealers in corn, therefore, including both the farmer and the baker,
are necessarily more numerous than the dealers in any other commodity,
and their dispersed situation renders it altogether impossible for them to
405 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
enterintoanygeneralcombination. Ifinayearofscarcity, therefore, any
ofthemshouldfindthathehadagooddealmorecornuponhandthan,at
thecurrentprice,hecouldhopetodisposeofbeforetheendoftheseason,
he would never think of keeping up this price to his own loss, and to the
solebenefitofhisrivalsandcompetitors, butwouldimmediatelylowerit,
in order to get rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in. The
same motives, the same interests, which would thus regulate the conduct
ofanyonedealer,wouldregulatethatofeveryother,andobligethemallin
general to sell their corn at the price which, according to the best of their
judgment,wasmostsuitabletothescarcityorplentyoftheseason.
1126 [5] Whoever examines with attention the history of the dearths and fam-
ines which have afflicted any part of Europe, during either the course of
the present or that of the two preceding centuries, of several of which we
have pretty exact accounts, will find, I believe, that a dearth never has
arisen from any combination among the inland dealers in corn, nor from
any other cause but a real scarcity, occasioned sometimes perhaps, and
in some particular places, by the waste of war, but in by far the greatest
number of cases by the fault of the seasons; and that a famine has never
arisenfromanyothercausebuttheviolenceofgovernmentattempting,by
impropermeans,toremedytheinconveniencesofadearth.
1127 [6] In an extensive corn country, between all the different parts of which
there is a free commerce and communication, the scarcity occasioned by
themostunfavourableseasonscanneverbesogreatastoproduceafam-
ine; and the scantiest crop, if managed with frugality and economy, will

unfavourable to the crop are those of excessive drought or excessive rain.
But as corn grows equally upon high and low lands, upon grounds that

either the drought or the rain which is hurtful to one part of the country G.ed.p527

quiresaverymoistsoil,butwhereinacertainperiodofitsgrowingitmust
be laid under water, the effects of a drought are much more dismal. Even
insuchcountries,however,thedroughtis,perhaps,scarceeversouniver-
sal as necessarily to occasion a famine, if the government would allow a
free trade. The drought in Bengal, a few years ago, might probably have
occasioned a very great dearth. Some improper regulations, some injudi-
ciousrestraintsimposedbytheservantsoftheEastIndiaCompanyupon
thericetrade,contributed,perhaps,toturnthatdearthintoafamine.

is the only effectual preventative of the miseries of a famine, so it is the
bestpalliativeoftheinconveniencesofadearth; fortheinconveniencesof
a real scarcity cannot be remedied, they can only be palliated. No trade
deserves more the full protection of the law, and no trade requires it so
much,becausenotradeissomuchexposedtopopularodium.
1129 [8] Inyearsofscarcitytheinferiorranksofpeopleimputetheirdistressto
the avarice of the corn merchant, who becomes the object of their hatred
and indignation. Instead of making profit upon such occasions, therefore,
heisoftenindangerofbeingutterlyruined, andofhavinghismagazines
plundered and destroyed by their violence. It is in years of scarcity, how-
ever, when prices are high, that the corn merchant expects to make his
principal profit. He is generally in contract with some farmers to fur-
nish him for a certain number of years with a certain quantity of corn
at a certain price. This contract price is settled according to what is sup-
posed to be the moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or average
price, which before the late years of scarcity was commonly about eight-
and-twenty shillings for the quarter of wheat, and for that of other grain
in proportion. In years of scarcity, therefore, the corn merchant buys a
greatpartofhiscornfortheordinaryprice,andsellsitforamuchhigher.
That this extraordinary profit, however, is no more than sufficient to put
histradeuponafairlevelwithothertrades,andtocompensatethemany
losses which he sustains upon other occasions, both from the perishable
natureofthecommodityitself,andfromthefrequentandunforeseenfluc- G.ed.p528

that great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in any other trade. The
popular odium, however, which attends it in years of scarcity, the only
years in which it can be very profitable, renders people of character and

407 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
feit all his goods and chattels. The ancient policy of most other parts of
EuropewasnobetterthanthatofEngland.
1132 [11] Our ancestors seem to have imagined that the people would buy their
corn cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant, who, they were
afraid,wouldrequire,overandabovethepricewhichhepaidtothefarmer,
anexorbitantprofittohimself. Theyendeavoured,therefore,toannihilate

three justices of the peace was, by the statute of Edward VI, necessary in
ordertograntthislicence. Buteventhisrestraintwasafterwardsthought

confinedtothequarter-sessions.
1133 [12] The ancient policy of Europe endeavoured in this manner to regulate G.ed.p529
agriculture,thegreattradeofthecountry,bymaximsquitedifferentfrom
those which it established with regard to manufactures, the great trade
of the towns. By leaving the farmer no other customers but either the
consumers or their immediate factors, the kidders and carriers of corn, it
endeavoured to force him to exercise the trade, not only of a farmer, but
of a corn merchant or corn retailer. On the contrary, it in many cases
prohibitedthemanufacturerfromexercisingthetradeofashopkeeper,or
fromsellinghisowngoodsbyretail. Itmeantbytheonelawtopromotethe

1134 [13] Themanufacturer,however,thoughhehadbeenallowedtokeepashop,
and to sell his own goods by retail, could not have undersold the common
shopkeeper. Whateverpartofhiscapitalhemighthaveplacedinhisshop,
he must have withdrawn it from his manufacture. In order to carry on
his business on a level with that of other people, as he must have had
the profit of a manufacturer on the one part, so he must have had that
of a shopkeeper upon the other. Let us suppose, for example, that in the
particulartownwherehelived,tenpercentwastheordinaryprofitbothof
manufacturing and shopkeeping stock; he must in this case have charged
upon every piece of his own goods which he sold in his shop, a profit of
twentypercent. Whenhecarriedthemfromhisworkhousetohisshop,he
must have valued them at the price for which he could have sold them to
a dealer or shopkeeper, who would have bought them by wholesale. If he
valuedthemlower,helostapartoftheprofitofhismanufacturingcapital.
When again he sold them from his shop, unless he got the same price at

whichashopkeeperwouldhavesoldthem,helostapartoftheprofitofhis

a part of two distinct capitals, he made but a single profit upon the whole
capitalemployedaboutthem;andifhemadelessthanhisprofit,hewasa

greaterpartofhisneighbours.
1135 [14] What the manufacturer was prohibited to do, the farmer was in some
measureenjoinedtodo;todividehiscapitalbetweentwodifferentemploy-

merchant, could not afford to sell his corn cheaper than any other corn

1137 [16] The law which prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade
of a shopkeeper endeavoured to force this division in the employment of
stock to go on faster than it might otherwise have done. The law which
obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant endeavoured
409 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to hinder it from going on so fast. Both laws were evident violations of
naturalliberty,andthereforeunjust;andtheywereboth,too,asimpolitic
as they were unjust. It is the interest of every society that things of this
kind should never either be forced or obstructed. The man who employs
eitherhislabourorhisstockinagreatervarietyofwaysthanhissituation
renders necessary can never hurt his neighbour by underselling him. He
mayhurthimself,andhegenerallydoesso. Jackofalltradeswillneverbe
rich, says the proverb. But the law ought always to trust people with the G.ed.p531
care of their own interest, as in their local situations they must generally
be able to judge better of it than the legislator can do. The law, however,
which obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant was by
farthemostperniciousofthetwo.
1138 [17] It obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which
issoadvantageoustoeverysociety,butitobstructedlikewisetheimprove-
ment and cultivation of the land. By obliging the farmer to carry on two
trades instead of one, it forced him to divide his capital into two parts, of
which one only could be employed in cultivation. But if he had been at
libertytosellhiswholecroptoacornmerchantasfastashecouldthresh

fore, necessarily obstructed the improvement of the land, and, instead of
tendingtorendercorncheaper,musthavetendedtorenderitscarcer,and
thereforedearer,thanitwouldotherwisehavebeen.
1139 [18] Afterthebusinessofthefarmer,thatofthecornmerchantisinreality
the trade which, if properly protected and encouraged, would contribute
themosttotheraisingofcorn. Itwouldsupportthetradeofthefarmerin
thesamemannerasthetradeofthewholesaledealersupportsthatofthe

too, is generally sufficient to replace that of many manufacturers, this in-
tercourse between him and them interests the owner of a large capital to
support the owners of a great number of small ones, and to assist them
in those losses and misfortunes which might otherwise prove ruinous to
them.
[20] An intercourse of the same kind universally established between the
1141
410 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
farmers and the corn merchants would be attended with effects equally
beneficial to the farmers. They would be enabled to keep their whole cap-
itals, and even more than their whole capitals, constantly employed in
cultivation. In case of any of those accidents, to which no trade is more
liablethantheirs,theywouldfindintheirordinarycustomer,thewealthy G.ed.p532
cornmerchant,apersonwhohadbothaninteresttosupportthem,andthe
ability to do it, and they would not, as at present, be entirely dependent
upon the forbearance of their landlord, or the mercy of his steward. Were

the operations of this great stock, to provide all at once another stock al-
most equally great, it is not perhaps very easy to imagine how great, how
extensive, and how sudden would be the improvement which this change
ofcircumstanceswouldaloneproduceuponthewholefaceofthecountry.
[21] The statute of Edward VI., therefore, by prohibiting as much as pos-
1142
sibleanymiddlemanfromcomingbetweenthegrowerandtheconsumer,
endeavoured to annihilate a trade, of which the free exercise is not only
the best palliative of the inconveniences of a dearth but the best prevent-
ativeofthatcalamity: afterthetradeofthefarmer,notradecontributing
somuchtothegrowingofcornasthatofthecornmerchant.
1143 [22] The rigour of this law was afterwards softened by several subsequent
statutes, which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the
priceofwheatshouldnotexceedtwenty,twenty-four,thirty-two,andforty
shillingsthequarter. Atlast,bythe15thofCharlesII.c.7.theengrossing
or buying of corn in order to sell it again, as long as the price of wheat
did not exceed forty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grain
in proportion, was declared lawful to all persons not being forestallers,
thatis,notsellingagaininthesamemarketwithinthreemonths. Allthe
freedomwhichthetradeoftheinlandcorndealerhaseveryetenjoyedwas
bestoweduponitbythisstatute. Thestatuteofthetwelfthofthepresent G.ed.p533
king, which repeals almost all the other ancient laws against engrossers
andforestallers,doesnotrepealtherestrictionsofthisparticularstatute,
whichthereforestillcontinueinforce.
[23] This statute, however, authorizes in some measure two very absurd
1144
popularprejudices.
1145 [24] First, it supposes that when the price of wheat has risen so high as
forty-eight shillings the quarter, and that of other grains in proportion,
corn is likely to be so engrossed as to hurt the people. But from what has
been already said, it seems evident enough that corn can at no price be
so engrossed by the inland dealers as to hurt the people: and forty-eight
shillings the quarter, besides, though it may be considered as a very high
price, yet in years of scarcity it is a price which frequently takes place
411 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
immediately after harvest, when scarce any part of the new crop can be
sold off, and when it is impossible even for ignorance to suppose that any
partofitcanbesoengrossedastohurtthepeople.
1146 [25] Secondly,itsupposesthatthereisacertainpriceatwhichcornislikely
to be forestalled, that is, bought up in order to be sold again soon after in
the same market, so as to hurt the people. But if a merchant ever buys
up corn, either going to a particular market or in a particular market, in
ordertosellitagainsoonafterinthesamemarket,itmustbebecausehe
judges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied through the whole
seasonasuponthatparticularoccasion,andthattheprice,therefore,must
soon rise. If he judges wrong in this, and if the price does not rise, he not
only loses the whole profit of the stock which he employs in this manner,
but a part of the stock itself, by the expense and loss which necessarily
attendthestoringandkeepingofcorn. Hehurtshimself,therefore,much
more essentially than he can hurt even the particular people whom he
may hinder from supplying themselves upon that particular market day,
because they may afterwards supply themselves just as cheap upon any
other market day. If he judges right, instead of hurting the great body of
the people, he renders them a most important service. By making them
feeltheinconvenienciesofadearthsomewhatearlierthantheyotherwise
might do, he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they
certainly would do, if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume
fasterthansuitedtherealscarcityoftheseason. Whenthescarcityisreal,
the best thing that can be done for the people is to divide the inconveni- G.ed.p534
encies of it as equally as possible through all the different months, and
weeks,anddaysoftheyear. Theinterestofthecornmerchantmakeshim
study to do this as exactly as he can: and as no other person can have
either the same interest, or the same knowledge, or the same abilities to

1147 [26] Thepopularfearofengrossingandforestallingmaybecomparedtothe
popular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft. The unfortunate wretches
accused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes
imputedtothemthanthosewhohavebeenaccusedoftheformer. Thelaw
which put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft, which put it out
of any man’s power to gratify his own malice by accusing his neighbour
of that imaginary crime, seems effectually to have put an end to those
fears and suspicions by taking away the great cause which encouraged
and supported them. The law which should restore entire freedom to the
inlandtradeofcornwouldprobablyproveaseffectualtoputanendtothe
popularfearsofengrossingandforestalling.
1148 [27] The 15th of Charles II. c.7. however, with all its imperfections, has
perhapscontributedmorebothtotheplentifulsupplyofthehomemarket,
and to the increase of tillage, than any other law in the statute book. It
412 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the liberty and
protection which it has ever yet enjoyed; and both the supply of the home
market,andtheinterestoftillage,aremuchmoreeffectuallypromotedby
theinlandthaneitherbytheimportationorexportationtrade.
1149 [28] The proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported
into Great Britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed, it has been com-

1150 [29] The average quantity of all sorts of grain exported from Great Britain

of the annual produce. For the encouragement of tillage, therefore, by
providing a market for the home produce, the importance of the inland

The great cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding the es-
tablishment of the bounty may perhaps, with reason, be ascribed in some
measure to the operation of this statute of Charles II., which had been
enacted about five-and-twenty years before, and which had therefore full
timetoproduceitseffect.
1152 [31] AveryfewwordswillsufficientlyexplainallthatIhavetosayconcern-

1153 [32] II. The trade of the merchant importer of foreign corn for home con-
sumptionevidentlycontributestotheimmediatesupplyofthehomemar-
ket, and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the
people. It tends, indeed, to lower somewhat the average money price of
corn, but not to diminish its real value, or the quantity of labour which it
iscapableofmaintaining. Ifimportationwasatalltimesfree,ourfarmers
and country gentlemen would, probably, one year with another, get less
moneyfortheircornthantheydoatpresent,whenimportationisatmost
timesineffectprohibited;butthemoneywhichtheygotwouldbeofmore
value, would buy more goods of all other kinds, and would employ more
labour. Theirrealwealth,theirrealrevenue,therefore,wouldbethesame
as at present, though it might be expressed by a smaller quantity of sil-
ver; and they would neither be disabled nor discouraged from cultivating
corn as much as they do at present. On the contrary, as the rise in the
real value of silver, in consequence of lowering the money price of corn,
lowers somewhat the money price of all other commodities, it gives the
industry of the country, where it takes place, some advantage in all for-
eign markets, and thereby tends to encourage and increase that industry.
But the extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion to the
413 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
general industry of the country where it grows, or to the number of those
who produce something else, and therefore have something else, or what
comes to the same thing, the price of something else, to give in exchange
for corn. But in every country the home market, as it is the nearest and G.ed.p536
mostconvenient,soisitlikewisethegreatestandmostimportantmarket

1154 [33] Bythe22ndofCharlesII.c.13.theimportationofwheat,wheneverthe
priceinthehomemarketdidnotexceedfifty-threeshillingsandfourpence
the quarter, was subjected to a duty of sixteen shillings the quarter, and
toadutyofeightshillingswheneverthepricedidnotexceedfourpounds.
The former of these two prices has, for more than a century past, taken
place only in times of very great scarcity; and the latter has, so far as I
know, not taken place at all. Yet, till wheat had risen above this latter
price, it was by this statute subjected to a very high duty; and, tin it had
risen above the former, to a duty which amounted to a prohibition. The
importation of other sorts of grain was restrained at rates, and by duties,
in proportion to the value of the grain, almost equally high2. Subsequent
lawsstillfurtherincreasedthoseduties.
1155 [34] The distress which, in years of scarcity, the strict execution of those
lawsmighthavebroughtuponthepeople,wouldprobablyhavebeenvery
great. But, upon such occasions, its execution was generally suspended
by temporary statutes, which permitted, for a limited time, the importa-
tionofforeigncorn. Thenecessityofthesetemporarystatutessufficiently

1156 [35] These restraints upon importation, though prior to the establishment G.ed.p537
of the bounty, were dictated by the same spirit, by the same principles,
which afterwards enacted that regulation. How hurtful soever in them-

selves,theseorsomeotherrestraintsuponimportationbecamenecessary
in consequence of that regulation. If, when wheat was either below forty-
eight shillings the quarter, or not much above it, foreign corn could have
beenimportedeitherdutyfree,oruponpayingonlyasmallduty,itmight
havebeenexportedagain, withthebenefitofthebounty, tothegreatloss
of the public revenue, and to the entire perversion of the institution, of
which the object was to extend the market for the home growth, not that
forthegrowthofforeigncountries.
1157 [36] III. The trade of the merchant exporter of corn for foreign consump-
tion certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the
home market. It does so, however, indirectly. From whatever source this
supplymaybeusuallydrawn, whetherfromhomegrowthorfromforeign
importation, unless more corn is either usually grown, or usually impor-
tedintothecountry,thanwhatisusuallyconsumedinit,thesupplyofthe
home market can never be very plentiful. But unless the surplus can in
all ordinary cases be exported, the growers will be careful never to grow
more, and the importers never to import more, than what the bare con-
sumption of the home market requires. That market will very seldom be
overstocked; butitwillgenerallybeunderstocked, thepeoplewhosebusi-
nessitistosupplyitbeinggenerallyafraidlesttheirgoodsshouldbeleft
upon their hands. The prohibition of exportation limits the improvement
and cultivation of the country to what the supply of its own inhabitants
requires. The freedom of exportation enables it to extend cultivation for
thesupplyofforeignnations.
1158 [37] By the 12th of Charles II. c.4. the exportation of corn was permitted
wheneverthepriceofwheatdidnotexceedfortyshillingsthequarter,and
that of other grain in proportion. By the 15th of the same prince, this
liberty was extended till the price of wheat exceeded forty-eight shillings
the quarter; and by the 22nd, to all higher prices. A poundage, indeed,
wasto bepaidtothe kinguponsuchexportation. But all grainwasrated
solow inthebook ofratesthat thispoundageamounted onlyuponwheat
to a shilling, upon oats to fourpence, and upon all other grain to sixpence
thequarter. Bythe1stofWilliamandMary,theactwhichestablishedthe
bounty,thissmalldutywasvirtuallytakenoffwheneverthepriceofwheat G.ed.p538
did not exceed, forty-eight shillings the quarter; and by the 11th and l2th
ofWilliamIII.c.20.itwasexpresslytakenoffatallhigherprices.
1159 [38] The trade of the merchant exporter was, in this manner, not only en-
couragedbyabounty,butrenderedmuchmorefreethanthatoftheinland
dealer. By the last of these statutes, corn could be engrossed at any price
for exportation, but it could not be engrossed for inland sale except when
the price did not exceed forty-eight shillings the quarter. The interest of
theinlanddealer,however,ithasalreadybeenshown,canneverbeoppos-
ite to that of the great body of the people. That of the merchant exporter
may, and in fact sometimes is. If, while his own country labours under a
dearth,aneighbouringcountryshouldbeafflictedwithafamine,itmight
415 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
be his interest to carry corn to the latter country in such quantities as
might very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth. The plentiful
supplyofthehomemarketwasnotthedirectobjectofthosestatutes;but,
underthepretenceofencouragingagriculture,toraisethemoneypriceof
corn as high as possible, and thereby to occasion, as much as possible, a
constant dearth in the home market. By the discouragement of importa-
tion, the supply of that market, even in times of great scarcity, was con-
finedtothehomegrowth;andbytheencouragementofexportation,when
thepricewassohighasforty-eightshillingsthequarter,thatmarketwas
not, even in times of considerable scarcity, allowed to enjoy the whole of
that growth. The temporary laws, prohibiting for a limited time the ex-
portation of corn, and taking off for a limited time the duties upon its
importation, expedients to which Great Britain has been obliged so fre-
quently to have recourse, sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of her
general system. Had that system been good, she would not so frequently
havebeenreducedtothenecessityofdepartingfromit.
1160 [39] Wereallnationstofollowtheliberalsystemoffreeexportationandfree
importation, the different states into which a great continent was divided
wouldsofarresemblethedifferentprovincesofagreatempire. Asamong
the different provinces of a great empire the freedom of the inland trade
appears, both from reason and experience, not only the best palliative of
a dearth, but the most effectual preventative of a famine; so would the
freedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the different
statesintowhichagreatcontinentwasdivided. Thelargerthecontinent,
theeasierthecommunicationthroughallthedifferentpartsofit,bothby G.ed.p539
land and by water, the less would any one particular part of it ever be ex-
posed to either of these calamities, the scarcity of any one country being
more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some other. But very few coun-
tries have entirely adopted this liberal system. The freedom of the corn
trade is almost everywhere more or less restrained, and, in many coun-
tries, is confined by such absurd regulations as frequently aggravate the
unavoidablemisfortuneofadearthintothedreadfulcalamityofafamine.
Thedemandofsuchcountriesforcornmayfrequentlybecomesogreatand
sourgentthatasmallstateintheirneighbourhood,whichhappenedatthe

to supply them without exposing itself to the like dreadful calamity. The
verybadpolicyofonecountrymaythusrenderitinsomemeasuredanger-
ousandimprudenttoestablishwhatwouldotherwisebethebestpolicyin
another. The unlimited freedom of exportation, however, would be much
less dangerous in great states, in which the growth being much greater,
thesupplycouldseldombemuchaffectedbyanyquantityofcornthatwas
likely to be exported. In a Swiss canton, or in some of the little states of
Italy, it may perhaps sometimes be necessary to restrain the exportation
of corn. In such great countries as France or England it scarce ever can.

bestmarketisevidentlytosacrificetheordinarylawsofjusticetoanidea
ofpublicutility,toasortofreasonsofstate;anactoflegislativeauthority
which ought to be exercised only, which can be pardoned only in cases of
the most urgent necessity. The price at which the exportation of corn is
prohibited, if it is ever to be prohibited, ought always to be a very high
price.
1161 [40] The laws concerning corn may everywhere be compared to the laws
concerningreligion. Thepeoplefeelthemselvessomuchinterestedinwhat
relateseitheroftheirsubsistenceinthislife,ortotheirhappinessinalife
to come, that government must yield to their prejudices, and, in order to
preservethepublictranquillity,establishthatsystemwhichtheyapprove
of. It is upon this account, perhaps, that we so seldom find a reasonable
systemestablishedwithregardtoeitherofthosetwocapitalobjects.
1162 [41] IV. The trade of the merchant carrier, or of the importer of foreign
corn in order to export it again, contributes to the plentiful supply of the
home market. It is not indeed the direct purpose of his trade to sell his
corn there. But he will generally be willing to do so, and even for a good
deal less money than he might expect in a foreign market; because he
savesinthismannertheexpenseofloadingandunloading, offreightand
insurance. Theinhabitantsofthecountrywhich,bymeansofthecarrying
trade, becomesthemagazineandstorehouseforthesupplyofothercoun- G.ed.p540
tries can very seldom be in want themselves. Though the carrying trade
might thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in the
homemarket,itwouldnottherebyloweritsrealvalue. Itwouldonlyraise
somewhattherealvalueofsilver.
1163 [42] The carrying trade was in effect prohibited in Great Britain, upon all
ordinaryoccasions,bythehighdutiesupontheimportationofforeigncorn,
ofthegreaterpartofwhichtherewasnodrawback; anduponextraordin-
ary occasions, when a scarcity made it necessary to suspend those duties
by temporary statutes, exportation was always prohibited. By this sys-
temoflaws,therefore,thecarryingtradewasineffectprohibiteduponall
occasions.
1164 [43] That system of laws, therefore, which is connected with the establish-
mentofthebounty,seemstodeservenopartofthepraisewhichhasbeen
bestoweduponit. TheimprovementandprosperityofGreatBritain,which
hasbeensooftenascribedtothoselaws,mayveryeasilybeaccountedfor
by other causes. That security which the laws in Great Britain give to
every man that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labour is alone suf-
ficient to make any country flourish, notwithstanding these and twenty
other absurd regulations of commerce; and this security was perfected by
therevolutionmuchaboutthesametimethatthebountywasestablished.

Europe, while Spain and Portugal are perhaps among the most beggarly.
Thisdifferenceofsituation,however,mayeasilybeaccountedforfromtwo
different causes. First, the tax of Spain, the prohibition in Portugal of
exporting gold and silver, and the vigilant police which watches over the
execution of those laws, must, in two very poor countries, which between
them import annually upwards of six millions sterling, operate not only
moredirectlybutmuchmoreforciblyinreducingthevalueofthosemetals
there than the corn laws can do in Great Britain. And, secondly, this bad
policyisnotinthosecountriescounterbalancedbythegenerallibertyand
security of the people. Industry is there neither free nor secure, and the

though their regulations of commerce were as wise as the greater part of
themareabsurdandfoolish.

temwithregardtothecornlawsinmanyrespectsbetterthantheancient

1168 [47] By this statute the high duties upon importations for home consump-
tionaretakenoffsosoonasthepriceofmiddlingwheatrisestoforty-eight
shillings the quarter; that of middling rye, pease or beans, to thirty-two
shillings;thatofbarleytotwenty-fourshillings;andthatofoatstosixteen

upon the quarter of wheat, and upon that of other grain in proportion.
With regard to all these different sorts of grain, but particularly with re-
gardtowheat,thehomemarketisthusopenedtoforeignsuppliesatprices
considerablylowerthanbefore.
1169 [48] By the same statute the old bounty of five shillings upon the exporta-
tion of wheat ceases so soon as the price rises to forty-four shillings the
quarter, instead of forty-eight, the price at which it ceased before; that of G.ed.p542
two shillings and sixpence upon the exportation of barley ceases so soon

rye is reduced from three shillings and sixpence to three shillings, and it
ceasessosoonasthepricerisestotwenty-eightshillingsinsteadofthirty-
two, the price at which it ceased before. If bounties are as improper as
I have endeavoured to prove them to be, the sooner they cease, and the
lowertheyare,somuchthebetter.
1170 [49] Thesamestatutepermits,atthelowestprices,theimportationofcorn,
in order to be exported again duty free, provided it is in the meantime
lodged in a warehouse under the joint locks of the king and the importer.
This liberty, indeed, extends to no more than twenty-five of the different
ports of Great Britain. They are, however, the principal ones, and there
may not, perhaps, be warehouses proper for this purpose in the greater
partoftheothers.
1171 [50] So far this law seems evidently an improvement upon the ancient sys-
tem.
1172 [51] But by the same law a bounty of two shillings the quarter is given for
the exportation of oats whenever the price does not exceed fourteen shil-
lings. No bounty had ever been given before for the exportation of this
grain,nomorethanforthatofpeaseorbeans.
1173 [52] By the same law, too, the exportation of wheat is prohibited so soon as
the price rises to forty-four shillings the quarter; that of rye so soon as it
risestotwenty-eightshillings; thatofbarleysosoonasitrisestotwenty-

1174 [53] So far, therefore, this law seems to be inferior to the ancient system.
With all its imperfections, however, we may perhaps say of it what was G.ed.p543
said of the laws of Solon, that, though not the best in itself, it is the best

419 CHAPTER VI
G.ed.p546
OF TREATIES OF COMMERCE
1175 [1] WHEN a nation binds itself by treaty either to permit the entry of certain
goodsfromoneforeigncountrywhichitprohibitsfromallothers,ortoex-
emptthegoodsofonecountryfromdutiestowhichitsubjectsthoseofall
others, the country, or at least the merchants and manufacturers of the
country,whosecommerceissofavoured,mustnecessarilyderivegreatad-
vantagefromthetreaty. Thosemerchantsandmanufacturersenjoyasort
of monopoly in the country which is so indulgent to them. That country
becomes a market both more extensive and more advantageous for their
goods: more extensive, because the goods of other nations being either
excluded or subjected to heavier duties, it takes off a greater quantity of
theirs: more advantageous, because the merchants of the favoured coun-
try,enjoyingasortofmonopolythere,willoftenselltheirgoodsforabetter
pricethanifexposedtothefreecompetitionofallothernations.
1176 [2] Such treaties, however, though they may be advantageous to the mer-
chants and manufacturers of the favoured, are necessarily disadvantage-
oustothoseofthefavouringcountry. Amonopolyisthusgrantedagainst
them to a foreign nation; and they must frequently buy the foreign goods
theyhaveoccasionfordearerthanifthefreecompetitionofothernations
was admitted. That part of its own produce with which such a nation
purchasesforeigngoodsmustconsequentlybesoldcheaper,becausewhen
two things are exchanged for one another, the cheapness of the one is a
necessary consequence, or rather the same thing with the dearness of the
other. Theexchangeablevalueofitsannualproduce,therefore,islikelyto
be diminished by every such treaty. This diminution, however, can scarce
amount to any positive loss, but only to a lessening of the gain which it
might otherwise make. Though it sells its goods cheaper than it other-
wise might do, it will not probably sell them for less than they cost; nor,
as in the case of bounties, for a price which will not replace the capital
employedinbringingthemtomarket,togetherwiththeordinaryprofitsof
stock. Thetradecouldnotgoonlongifitdid. Eventhefavouringcountry,
therefore, maystillgainbythetrade, thoughlessthaniftherewasafree

1177 [3] Sometreatiesofcommerce,however,havebeensupposedadvantageous
upon principles very different from these; and a commercial country has TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
sometimesgrantedamonopolyofthiskindagainstitselftocertaingoodsof
aforeignnation,becauseitexpectedthatinthewholecommercebetween
them,itwouldannuallysellmorethanitwouldbuy,andthatabalancein
gold and silver would be annually returned to it. It is upon this principle
that the treaty of commerce between England and Portugal, concluded in G.ed.p546
1703 by Mr. Methuen, has been so much commended. The following is a
literaltranslationofthattreaty,whichconsistsofthreearticlesonly.

1178 [4] His sacred royal majesty of Portugal promises, both in his own name,
and that of his successors, to admit, for ever hereafter, into Portugal, the
woollencloths,andtherestofthewoollenmanufacturesoftheBritish,as
was accustomed, till they were prohibited by the law; nevertheless upon
thiscondition:
ART. II
1179 [5] That is to say, that her sacred royal majesty of Great Britain shall, in
herownname,andthatofhersuccessors,beobliged,foreverhereafter,to
admitthewinesofthegrowthofPortugalintoBritain;sothatatnotime,
whetherthereshallbepeaceorwarbetweenthekingdomsofBritainand
France, anything more shall be demanded for these wines by the name of
customorduty,orbywhatsoeverothertitle,directlyorindirectly,whether
they shall be imported into Great Britain in or hogsheads, or other casks,
than what shall be demanded for the like quantity or measure of French
wine, deducting or abating a third part of the custom or duty. But if at
any time this deduction or abatement of customs, which is to be made as
aforesaid, shall in any manner be attempted and prejudiced, it shall be
just and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of Portugal, again to prohibit
thewoollencloths,andtherestoftheBritishwoollenmanufactures.
ART. III
1180 [6] The most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promise and take upon
themselves, that their above named masters shall ratify this treaty; and
withinthespaceoftwomonthstheratificationsshallbeexchanged.
1181 [7] By this treaty the crown of Portugal becomes bound to admit the Eng-
lish woollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition; that is, not
to raise the duties which had been paid before that time. But it does not
becomeboundtoadmitthemuponanybettertermsthanthoseofanyother G.ed.p547
nation, of France or Holland for example. The crown of Great Britain, on
the contrary, becomes bound to admit the wines of Portugal upon paying
only two-thirds of the duty which is paid for those of France, the wines
most likely to come into competition with them. So far this treaty, there-
fore,isevidentlyadvantageoustoPortugal,anddisadvantageoustoGreat
Britain.
1182 [8] It has been celebrated, however, as a masterpiece of the commercial
policy of England. Portugal receives annually from the Brazils a greater
421 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
quantity of gold thancan be employed in its domestic commerce, whether
intheshapeofcoinorofplate. Thesurplusistoovaluabletobeallowedto
lieidleandlockedupincoffers,andasitcanfindnoadvantageousmarket
athome,itmust,notwithstandinganyprohibition,besentabroad,andex-
changed for something for which there is a more advantageous market at
home. A large share of it comes annually to England, in return either for
Englishgoods,orforthoseofotherEuropeannationsthatreceivetheirre-
turnsthroughEngland. Mr.Barettiwasinformedthattheweeklypacket-
boatfromLisbonbrings,oneweekwithanother,morethanfiftythousand
pounds in gold to England. The sum had probably been exaggerated. It
would amount to more than two millions six hundred thousand pounds a
year,whichismorethantheBrazilsaresupposedtoafford.
1183 [9] Our merchants were some years ago out of humour with the crown of
Portugal. Someprivilegeswhichhadbeengrantedthem,notbytreaty,but
bythefreegraceofthatcrown,atthesolicitationindeed,itisprobable,and
inreturnformuchgreaterfavours,defenceandprotection,fromthecrown
of Great Britain had been either infringed or revoked. The people, there-
fore, usually most interested in celebrating the Portugal trade were then
ratherdisposedtorepresentitaslessadvantageousthanithadcommonly
been imagined. The far greater part, almost the whole, they pretended,
of this annual importation of gold, was not on account of Great Britain,
but of other European nations; the fruits and wines of Portugal annually
imported into Great Britain nearly compensating the value of the British
goodssentthither.
1184 [10] Let us suppose, however, that the whole was on account of Great
Britain,andthatitamountedtoastillgreatersumthanMr.Barettiseems G.ed.p548

kingdom. Therestmustallbesentabroadandexchangedforconsumable
goodsofsomekindorother. Butifthoseconsumablegoodswerepurchased
directly with the produce of English industry, it would be more for the
advantage of England than first to purchase with that produce the gold
of Portugal, and afterwards to purchase with that gold those consumable
goods. Adirectforeigntradeofconsumptionisalwaysmoreadvantageous
than a round-about one; and to bring the same value of foreign goods to
the home market, requires a much smaller capital in the one way than in
the other. If a smaller share of its industry, therefore, had been employed
inproducinggoodsfitforthePortugalmarket,andagreaterinproducing
those fit for the other markets, where those consumable goods for which

1186 [12] ThoughBritainwereentirelyexcludedfromthePortugaltrade,itcould
findverylittledifficultyinprocuringalltheannualsuppliesofgoldwhich
it wants, either for the purposes of plate, or of coin, or of foreign trade.
Gold, like every other commodity, is always somewhere or another to be
got for its value by those who have that value to give for it. The annual
surplusofgoldinPortugal,besides,wouldstillbesentabroad,andthough
not carried away by Great Britain, would be carried away by some other
nation,whichwouldbegladtosellitagainforitsprice,inthesameman-
nerasGreatBritaindoesatpresent. InbuyinggoldofPortugal,indeed,we
buy it at the first hand; whereas, in buying it of any other nation, except
Spain, we should buy it at the second, and might pay somewhat dearer.
This difference, however, would surely be too insignificant to deserve the
publicattention.

1188 [14] It was upon this silly notion, however, that England could not subsist
without the Portugal trade, that, towards the end of the late war, France
and Spain, without pretending either offence or provocation, required the
King of Portugal to exclude all British ships from his ports, and for the
security of this exclusion, to receive into them French or Spanish garris-
ons. HadthekingofPortugalsubmittedtothoseignominioustermswhich
his brother-in-law the king of Spain proposed to him, Britain would have
been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the Por-
tugal trade, the burden of supporting a very weak ally, so unprovided of
everything for his own defence that the whole power of England, had it
been directed to that single purpose, could scarce perhaps have defended
himforanothercampaign. ThelossofthePortugaltradewould,nodoubt,
have occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at that
time engaged in it, who might not, perhaps, have found out, for a year
or two, any other equally advantageous method of employing their capit-
423 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
als;andinthiswouldprobablyhaveconsistedalltheinconveniencywhich
Englandcouldhavesufferedfromthisnotablepieceofcommercialpolicy.
1189 [15] The great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the pur-
poseofplatenorofcoin,butofforeigntrade. Around-aboutforeigntrade
of consumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these
metals than of almost any other goods. As they are the universal instru-
ments of commerce, they are more readily received in return for all com-
modities than any other goods; and on account of their small bulk and
great value, it costs less to transport them backward and forward from
one place to another than almost any other sort of merchandise, and they
lose less of their value by being so transported. Of all the commodities,
therefore, which are bought in one foreign country, for no other purpose
but to be sold or exchanged again for some other goods in another, there
are none so convenient as gold and silver. In facilitating all the different
round-about foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in Great

the greater part of the annual coinage, amounting, for ten years together,
before the late reformation of the gold coin, to upwards of eight hundred
thousandpoundsayearingold, wasanannualadditiontothemoneybe-

thatofanequalquantityofthosemetalsuncoined;becauseitrequiresonly
the trouble of going to the mint, and the delay perhaps of a few weeks, to
procure for any quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of
those metals in coin. But, in every country, the greater part of the cur-
rent coin is almost always more or less worn, or otherwise degenerated
from its standard. In Great Britain it was, before the late reformation, a
good deal so, the gold being more than two per cent and the silver more
than eight per cent below its standard weight. But if forty-four guineas
and a half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of gold,
could purchase very little more than a pound weight could of uncoined
gold,forty-fourguineasandahalfwantingapartoftheirweightcouldnot

thananyotherordinaryguineas,becausewhentheycameintothecoffers
of the merchant, being confounded with other money, they could not af- G.ed.p551
terwards be distinguished without more trouble than the difference was
worth. Like other guineas they were worth no more than 46l.14s.6d. If
thrown into the melting pot, however, they produced, without any sens-
ibleloss,apoundweightofstandardgold,whichcouldbesoldatanytime
for between 47l.14s. and 48l. either of gold or silver, as fit for all the pur-
poses of coin as that which had been melted down. There was an evident
profit, therefore, in melting down new coined money, and it was done so
instantaneously, that no precaution of government could prevent it. The
operations of the mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of
Penelope;theworkthatwasdoneinthedaywasundoneinthenight. The
mintwasemployed, notsomuchinmakingdailyadditionstothecoin, as
inreplacingtheverybestpartofitwhichwasdailymelteddown.
1193 [19] Weretheprivatepeople,whocarrytheirgoldandsilvertothemint,to
pay themselves for the coinage, it would add to the value of those metals
in the same manner as the fashion does to that of plate. Coined gold and
silverwouldbemorevaluablethanuncoined. Theseignorage,ifitwasnot
exorbitant, would add to thebullion the whole value of the duty; because,
the government having everywhere the exclusive privilege of coining, no
coin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it. If
the duty was exorbitant indeed, that is, if it was very much above the
real value of the labour and expense requisite for coinage, false coiners,
both at home and abroad, might be encouraged, by the great difference
betweenthevalueofbullionandthatofcoin,topourinsogreataquantity
of counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government money.
In France, however, though the seignorage is eight per cent, no sensible
inconveniency of this kind is found to arise from it. The dangers to which
a false coiner is everywhere exposed, if he lives in the country of which
he counterfeits the coin, and to which his agents or correspondents are
exposed if he lives in a foreign country, are by far too great to be incurred
forthesakeofaprofitofsixorsevenpercent.
1194 [20] The seignorage in France raises the value of the coin higher than in
proportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains. Thus by the
edict of January 1726, the1 mint price of fine gold of twenty-four carats G.ed.p552
wasfixedatsevenhundredandfortylivresninesousandonedenierone-
eleventh,themarkofeightParisounces. ThegoldcoinofFrance,making

425 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
an allowance for the remedy of the mint, contains twenty-one carats and
three-fourths of fine gold, and two carats one fourth of alloy. The mark
of standard gold, therefore, is worth no more than about six hundred and
seventy-one livres ten deniers. But in France this mark of standard gold
is coined into thirty Louis-d’ors of twenty-four livres each, or into seven
hundred and twenty livres. The coinage, therefore, increases the value of
a mark of standard gold bullion, by the difference between six hundred
and seventy-one livres ten deniers, and seven hundred and twenty livres;
orbyforty-eightlivresnineteensousandtwodeniers.
1195 [21] A seignorage will, in many cases, take away altogether, and will, in
all cases, diminish the profit of melting down the new coin. This profit
always arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion which
the common currency ought to contain, and that which it actually does
contain. If this difference is less than the seignorage, there will be loss
instead of profit. If it is equal to the seignorage, there will neither be
profit nor loss. If it is greater than the seignorage, there will indeed be
some profit, but less than if there was no seignorage. If, before the late
reformation of the gold coin, for example, there had been a seignorage of
five per cent upon the coinage, there would have been a loss of three per
centuponthemeltingdownofthegoldcoin. Iftheseignoragehadbeentwo
per cent there would have been neither profit nor loss. If the seignorage
had been one per cent there would have been a profit, but of one per cent
onlyinsteadoftwopercent. Wherevermoneyisreceivedbytale,therefore,
and not by weight, a seignorage is the most effectual preventative of the
melting down of the coin, and, for the same reason, of its exportation. It
is the best and heaviest pieces that are commonly either melted down or
exported;becauseitisuponsuchthatthelargestprofitsaremade.
1196 [22] The law for encouragement of the coinage, by rendering it duty-free,
was first enacted during the reign of Charles II. for a limited time; and
afterwards continued, by different prolongations, till 1769, when it was
rendered perpetual. The Bank of England, in order to replenish their cof-
fers with money, are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint; and
it was more for their interest, they probably imagined, that the coinage
should be at the expense of the government than at their own. It was
probably out of complaisance to this great company that the government
agreed to render this law perpetual. Should the custom of weighing gold, G.ed.p553
however, come to be disused, as it is very likely to be on account of its in-
conveniency; should the gold coin of England come to be received by tale,
as it was before the late recoinage, this great company may, perhaps, find
that they have upon this, as upon some other occasions, mistaken their
owninterestnotalittle.
1197 [23] Beforethelatere-coinage,whenthegoldcurrencyofEnglandwastwo
percentbelowitsstandardweight,astherewasnoseignorage,itwastwo
per cent below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which
it ought to have contained. When this great company, therefore, bought
426 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
gold bullion in order to have it coined, they were obliged to pay for it two
per cent more than it was worth after coinage. But if there had been a
seignorage of two per cent upon the coinage, the common gold currency,
though two per cent below its standard weight, would notwithstanding
have been equal in value to the quantity of standard gold which it ought
to have contained; the value of the fashion compensating in this case the
diminution of the weight. They would indeed have had the seignorage to
pay,whichbeingtwopercent,theirlossuponthewholetransactionwould
have been two per cent exactly the same, but no greater than it actually
was.
1198 [24] If the seignorage had been five per cent, and the gold currency only
two per cent below its standard weight, the bank would in this case have
gainedthreepercentuponthepriceofthebullion;butastheywouldhave
had a seignorage of five per cent to pay upon the coinage, their loss upon
the whole transaction would, in the same manner, have been exactly two
percent.
1199 [25] Iftheseignoragehadbeenonlyonepercentandthegoldcurrencytwo

onlyonepercentuponthepriceofthebullion;butastheywouldlikewise
have had a seignorage of one per cent to pay, their loss upon the whole
transaction would have been exactly two per cent in the same manner as
inallothercases.
1200 [26] If there was a reasonable seignorage, while at the same time the coin
containeditsfullstandardweight,asithasdoneverynearlysincethelast
recoinage, whatever the bank might lose by the seignorage, they would
gainuponthepriceofthebullion;andwhatevertheymightgainuponthe
priceofthebullion,theywouldlosebytheseignorage. Theywouldneither
lose nor gain, therefore, upon the whole transaction, and they would in
this, as in all the foregoing cases, be exactly in the same situation as if
therewasnoseignorage.
1201 [27] When the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage
smuggling, the merchant who deals in it, though he advances, does not
properly pay the tax, as he gets it back in the price of the commodity. G.ed.p554
The tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer. But money is a
commoditywithregardtowhicheverymanisamerchant. Nobodybuysit

nolastpurchaserorconsumer. Whenthetaxuponcoinage,therefore,isso
moderateasnottoencouragefalsecoining,thougheverybodyadvancesthe

1202 [28] A moderate seignorage, therefore, would not in any case augment the
expenseofthebank,orofanyotherprivatepersonswhocarrytheirbullion
to the mint in order to be coined, and the want of a moderate seignorage
does not in any case diminish it. Whether there is or is not a seignorage,
ifthecurrencycontainsitsfullstandardweight,thecoinagecostsnothing
427 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to anybody, and if it is short of that weight, the coinage must always cost
thedifferencebetweenthequantityofbullionwhichoughttobecontained

1203 [29] Thegovernment,therefore,whenitdefraystheexpenseofcoinage,not
only incurs some small expense, but loses some small revenue which it
might get by a proper duty; and neither the bank nor any other private
personsareinthesmallestdegreebenefitedbythisuselesspieceofpublic
generosity.
1204 [30] The directors of the bank, however, would probably be unwilling to
agree to the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a specula-
tion which promises them no gain, but only pretends to insure them from
anyloss. Inthepresentstateofthegoldcoin,andaslongasitcontinuesto
bereceivedbyweight,theycertainlywouldgainnothingbysuchachange.
Butifthecustomofweighingthegoldcoinshouldevergointomisuse, as
it is very likely to do, and if the gold coin should ever fall into the same
stateofdegradationinwhichitwasbeforethelatere-coinage,thegain,or
moreproperlythesavingsofthebank,inconsequenceoftheimpositionof
a seignorage, would probably be very considerable. The Bank of England
is the only company which sends any considerable quantity of bullion to
the mint, and the burden of the annual coinage falls entirely, or almost
entirely,uponit. Ifthisannualcoinagehadnothingtodobuttorepairthe
unavoidablelossesandnecessarywearandtearofthecoin,itcouldseldom
exceed fifty thousand or at most a hundred thousand pounds. But when
the coin is degraded below its standard weight, the annual coinage must,
besides this, fill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting
pot are continually making in the current coin. It was upon this account
thatduringthetenortwelveyearsimmediatelyprecedingthelatereform- G.ed.p555
ationofthegoldcoin,theannualcoinageamountedatanaveragetomore
thaneighthundredandfiftythousandpounds. Butiftherehadbeenasei-
gnorageoffourorfivepercentuponthegoldcoin,itwouldprobably,even
in the state in which things then were, have put an effectual stop to the
business both of exportation and of the melting pot. The bank, instead of
losingeveryyearabouttwoandahalfpercentuponthebullionwhichwas
to be coined into more than eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds, or
incurring an annual loss of more than twenty-one thousand two hundred
and fifty pounds, would not probably have incurred the tenth part of that
loss.
1205 [31] The revenue allotted by Parliament for defraying the expense of the
coinage is but fourteen thousand pounds a year, and the real expense
which it costs the government, or the fees of the officers of the mint, do
not upon ordinary occasions, I am assured, exceed the half of that sum.
The saving of so very small a sum, or even the gaining of another which
could not well be much larger, are objects too inconsiderable, it may be
thought, to deserve the serious attention of government. But the saving

1206 [32] Someoftheforegoingreasoningsandobservationsmightperhapshave
been more properly placed in those chapters of the first book which treat
of the originand use of money, andof the difference between thereal and
the nominal price of commodities. But as the law for the encouragement
ofcoinagederivesitsoriginfromthosevulgarprejudiceswhichhavebeen
introduced by the mercantile system, I judged it more proper to reserve
them for this chapter. Nothing could be more agreeable to the spirit of
that system than a sort of bounty upon the production of money, the very
thing which, it supposes, constitutes the wealth of every nation. It is one

OF COLONIES
PART FIRST
Of the Motives for establishing new Colonies
1207 [1] THE interest which occasioned the first settlement of the different
European colonies in America and the West Indies was not altogether
so plain and distinct as that which directed the establishment of those of
ancientGreeceandRome.
1208 [2] All the different states of ancient Greece possessed, each of them, but
a very small territory, and when the people in any one of them multiplied

precedingthefoundationofRome,wereinhabitedbybarbarousandunciv-
ilisednations: thoseoftheIoniansandAeolians,thetwoothergreattribes
of the Greeks, to Asia Minor and the islands of the Aegean Sea, of which
the inhabitants seem at that time to have been pretty much in the same
state as those of Sicily and Italy. The mother city, though she considered
the colony as a child, at all times entitled to great favour and assistance,
and owing in return much gratitude and respect, yet considered it as an
emancipated child over whom she pretended to claim no direct authority
or jurisdiction. The colony settled its own form of government, enacted
itsownlaws, electeditsownmagistrates, andmadepeaceorwarwithits
neighboursasanindependentstate,whichhadnooccasiontowaitforthe

distinctthantheinterestwhichdirectedeverysuchestablishment.
1209 [3] Rome, like most of the other ancient republics, was originally founded
upon an Agrarian law which divided the public territory in a certain pro-
portion among the different citizens who composed the state. The course TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of human affairs by marriage, by succession, and by alienation, necessar-
ily deranged this original division, and frequently threw the lands, which G.ed.p557
hadbeenallottedforthemaintenanceofmanydifferentfamilies,intothe
possessionofasingleperson. Toremedythisdisorder,forsuchitwassup-
posed to be, a law was made restricting the quantity of land which any
citizencouldpossesstofivehundredjugera,aboutthreehundredandfifty
English acres. This law, however, though we read of its having been ex-
ecutedupononeortwooccasions,waseitherneglectedorevaded,andthe
inequality of fortunes went on continually increasing. The greater part of
thecitizenshadnoland,andwithoutitthemannersandcustomsofthose
times rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his independency. In
the present time, though a poor man has no land of his own, if he has a
little stock he may either farm the lands of another, or he may carry on
some little retail trade; and if he has no stock, he may find employment
either as a country labourer or as an artificer. But among the ancient
Romans the lands of the rich were all cultivated by slaves, who wrought
under an overseer who was likewise a slave; so that a poor freeman had
little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as a labourer. All
tradesandmanufacturestoo,eventheretailtrade,werecarriedonbythe
slaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth, author-
ity, and protection made it difficult for a poor freeman to maintain the
competition against them. The citizens, therefore, who had no land, had
scarce any other means of subsistence but the bounties of the candidates
at the annual elections. The tribunes, when they had a mind to animate
thepeopleagainsttherichandthegreat,puttheminmindoftheancient
division of lands, and represented that law which restricted this sort of
private property as the fundamental law of the republic. The people be-
came clamorous to get land, and the rich and the great, we may believe,
were perfectly determined not to give them any part of theirs. To satisfy
them in some measure therefore, they frequently proposed to send out a
newcolony. ButconqueringRomewas,evenuponsuchoccasions,underno
necessity of turning out her citizens to seek their fortune, if one may say
so, through the wide world, without knowing where they were to settle.
She assigned them lands generally in the conquered provinces of Italy,
where, being within the dominions of the republic, they could never form
an independent state; but were at best but a sort of corporation, which,
thoughithadthepowerofenactingbye-lawsforitsowngovernment,was
at all times subject to the correction, jurisdiction, and legislative author- G.ed.p558
ity of the mother city. The sending out a colony of this kind not only gave
some satisfaction to the people, but often established a sort of garrison,
too, in a newly conquered province, of which the obedience might other-
wise have been doubtful. A Roman colony therefore, whether we consider
the nature of the establishment itself or the motives for making it, was
altogetherdifferentfromaGreekone. Thewordsaccordingly,whichinthe
originallanguagesdenotethosedifferentestablishments,haveverydiffer-
431 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
entmeanings. TheLatinword(Colonia)signifiessimplyaplantation. The
Greek word αποιχια, on the contrary, signifies a separation of dwelling, a
departure from home, a going out of the house. But, though the Roman
colonieswereinmanyrespectsdifferentfromtheGreekones,theinterest
which prompted to establish them was equally plain and distinct. Both
institutions derived their origin either from irresistible necessity, or from
clearandevidentutility.
1210 [4] The establishment of the European colonies in America and the West
Indies arose from no necessity: and though the utility which has resulted
from them has been very great, it is not altogether so clear and evident.
Itwasnotunderstoodattheirfirstestablishment,andwasnotthemotive
either of that establishment or of the discoveries which gave occasion to
it, and the nature, extent, and limits of that utility are not, perhaps, well
understoodatthisday.
[5] The Venetians, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, carried
1211
onaveryadvantageouscommerceinspiceries,andotherEastIndiagoods,
which they distributed among the other nations of Europe. They pur-
chased them chiefly in Egypt, at that time under the dominion of the
Mamelukes,theenemiesoftheTurks,ofwhomtheVenetiansweretheen-
emies; andthisunionofinterest, assistedbythemoneyofVenice, formed
suchaconnectionasgavetheVenetiansalmostamonopolyofthetrade.
[6] The great profits of the Venetians tempted the avidity of the Por-
1212
tuguese. They had been endeavouring, during the course of the fifteenth
century, to find out by sea a way to the countries from which the Moors
brought them ivory and gold dust across the desert. They discovered the
Madeiras, the Canaries, the Azores, the Cape de Verde Islands, the coast
of Guinea, that of Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela, and, finally, the
CapeofGoodHope. Theyhadlongwishedtoshareintheprofitabletraffic
of the Venetians, and this last discovery opened to them a probable pro- G.ed.p559
spect of doing so. In 1497, Vasco de Gama sailed from the port of Lisbon
with a fleet of four ships, and after a navigation of eleven months arrived
upon the coast of Indostan, and thus completed a course of discoveries
which had been pursued with great steadiness, and with very little inter-
ruption,fornearlyacenturytogether.
1213 [7] Some years before this, while the expectations of Europe were in sus-
penseabouttheprojectsofthePortuguese,ofwhichthesuccessappeared
yet to be doubtful, a Genoese pilot formed the yet more daring project of
sailingtotheEastIndiesbytheWest. Thesituationofthosecountrieswas
at that time very imperfectly known in Europe. The few European trav-
ellers who had been there had magnified the distance, perhaps through
simplicityandignorance,whatwasreallyverygreatappearingalmostin-
finite to those who could not measure it; or, perhaps, in order to increase
somewhatmorethemarvellousoftheirownadventuresinvisitingregions
so immensely remote from Europe. The longer the way was by the East,
Columbus very justly concluded, the shorter it would be by the West. He
432 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
proposed, therefore, to take that way, as both the shortest and the surest,
and he had the good fortune to convince Isabella of Castile of the probab-
ilityofhisproject. HesailedfromtheportofPalosinAugust1492,nearly
five years before the expedition of Vasco de Gama set out from Portugal,
and,afteravoyageofbetweentwoandthreemonths,discoveredfirstsome
ofthesmallBahamasorLucayanislands,andafterwardsthegreatisland
ofSt.Domingo.
[8] But the countries which Columbus discovered, either in this or in any
1214
ofhissubsequentvoyages,hadnoresemblancetothosewhichhehadgone
in quest of. Instead of the wealth, cultivation, and populousness of China
and Indostan, he found, in St. Domingo, and in all the other parts of the
newworldwhichheevervisited,nothingbutacountryquitecoveredwith
wood,uncultivated,andinhabitedonlybysometribesofnakedandmiser-
able savages. He was not very willing, however, to believe that they were
notthesamewithsomeofthecountriesdescribedbyMarcoPolo,thefirst
Europeanwhohadvisited,oratleasthadleftbehindhim,anydescription
of China or the East Indies; and a very slight resemblance, such as that
which he found between the name of Cibao, a mountain in St. Domingo,
andthatofCipangomentionedbyMarcoPolo,wasfrequentlysufficientto
make him return to this favourite prepossession, though contrary to the
clearest evidence. In his letters to Ferdinand and Isabella he called the
countries which he had discovered, the Indies. He entertained no doubt G.ed.p560
but that they were the extremity of those which had been described by
MarcoPolo,andthattheywerenotverydistantfromtheGanges,orfrom
thecountrieswhichhadbeenconqueredbyAlexander. Evenwhenatlast
convincedthattheyweredifferent,hestillflatteredhimselfthatthoserich
countries were at no great distance, and, in a subsequent voyage, accord-
ingly, went in quest of them along the coast of Terra Firma, and towards
theIsthmusofDarien.
1215 [9] In consequence of this mistake of Columbus, the name of the Indies
has stuck to those unfortunate countries ever since; and when it was at
lastclearlydiscoveredthatthenewwerealtogetherdifferentfromtheold
Indies, the former were called the West, in contradistinction to the latter,
whichwerecalledtheEastIndies.
1216 [10] ItwasofimportancetoColumbus,however,thatthecountrieswhichhe
haddiscovered,whatevertheywere,shouldberepresentedtothecourtof
Spainasofverygreatconsequence;and,inwhatconstitutestherealriches
of every country, the animal and vegetable productions of the soil, there
wasatthattimenothingwhichcouldwelljustifysucharepresentationof
them.
1217 [11] The Cori, something between a rat and a rabbit, and supposed by
Mr. Buffon to be the same with the Aperea of Brazil, was the largest vi-
viparous quadruped in St. Domingo. This species seems never to have
been very numerous, and the dogs and cats of the Spaniards are said to
have long ago almost entirely extirpated it, as well as some other tribes
433 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ofa stillsmallersize. These, however, togetherwith aprettylargelizard,
called the ivana, or iguana, constituted the principal part of the animal
foodwhichthelandafforded.
1218 [12] The vegetable food of the inhabitants, though from their want of in-
dustry not very abundant, was not altogether so scanty. It consisted in
Indian corn, yams, potatoes, bananas, etc., plants which were then alto-
gether unknown in Europe, and which have never since been very much
esteemed in it, or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn
from the common sorts of grain and pulse, which have been cultivated in
thispartoftheworldtimeoutofmind.
1219 [13] The cotton plant, indeed, afforded the material of a very important
manufacture, and was at that time to Europeans undoubtedly the most
valuable of all the vegetable productions of those islands. But though
in the end of the fifteenth century the muslins and other cotton goods of
the East Indies were much esteemed in every part of Europe, the cotton
manufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of it. Even this produc- G.ed.p561
tion, therefore, could not at that time appear in the eyes of Europeans to
beofverygreatconsequence.
1220 [14] Finding nothing either in the animals or vegetables of the newly dis-
covered countries which could justify a very advantageous representation
of them, Columbus turned his view towards their minerals; and in the
richness of the productions of this third kingdom, he flattered himself he
had found a full compensation for the insignificancy of those of the other
two. The little bits of gold with which the inhabitants ornamented their
dress, and which, he was informed, they frequently found in the rivulets
and torrents that fell from the mountains, were sufficient to satisfy him
thatthosemountainsaboundedwiththerichestgoldmines. St.Domingo,
therefore, was represented as a country abounding with gold, and, upon
thataccount,(accordingtotheprejudicesnotonlyofthepresenttime,but
of those times) an inexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and
kingdom of Spain. When Columbus, upon his return from his first voy-
age, was introduced with a sort of triumphal honours to the sovereigns of
Castile and Arragon, the principal productions of the countries which he
had discovered were carried in solemn procession before him. The only
valuable part of them consisted in some little fillets, bracelets, and other
ornaments of gold, and in some bales of cotton. The rest were mere ob-
jects of vulgar wonder and curiosity; some reeds of an extraordinary size,
somebirdsofaverybeautifulplumage,andsomestuffedskinsofthehuge
alligator and manati; all of which were preceded by six or seven of the
wretched natives, whose singular colour and appearance added greatly to
thenoveltyoftheshew.
[15] In consequence of the representations of Columbus, the council of
1221
Castile determined to take possession of countries of which the inhabit-
ants were plainly incapable of defending themselves. The pious purpose
of converting them to Christianity sanctified the injustice of the project.
434 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
But the hope of finding treasures of gold there was the sole motive which
promptedhimtoundertakeit;andtogivethismotivethegreaterweight,
it was proposed by Columbus that the half of all the gold and silver that
should be found there should belong to the crown. This proposal was ap-
provedofbythecouncil.
[16] Aslongasthewholeorthefargreaterpartofthegold, whichthefirst

of all that they had, which, in St. Domingo, and in all the other countries

Nothinglesspreciousthangoldseemedworthyoftheirattention.
1223 [17] AlltheotherenterprisesoftheSpaniardsinthenewworld,subsequent
to those of Columbus, seem to have been prompted by the same motive.
It was the sacred thirst of gold that carried Oieda, Nicuessa, and Vasco
NugnesdeBalboa,totheIsthmusofDarien,thatcarriedCorteztoMexico,
and Almagro and Pizzarro to Chili and Peru. When those adventurers
arrived upon any unknown coast, their first inquiry was always if there
was any gold to be found there; and according to the information which
they received concerning this particular, they determined either to quit
thecountryortosettleinit.
[18] Of all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring
1224
bankruptcyuponthegreaterpartofthepeoplewhoengageinthem,there
is none perhaps more ruinous than the search after new silver and gold
mines. Itisperhapsthemostdisadvantageouslotteryintheworld,orthe
oneinwhichthegainofthosewhodrawtheprizesbearstheleastpropor-
tion to the loss of those who draw the blanks: for though the prizes are
fewandtheblanksmany,thecommonpriceofaticketisthewholefortune
of a very rich man. Projects of mining, instead of replacing the capital
employed in them, together with the ordinary profits of stock, commonly
absorb both capital and profit. They are the projects, therefore, to which
of all others a prudent lawgiver, who desired to increase the capital of his
nation, would least choose to give any extraordinary encouragement, or
to turn towards them a greater share of that capital than that would go
to them of its own accord. Such in reality is the absurd confidence which
almostallmenhaveintheirowngoodfortunethat,whereverthereisthe
435 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
leastprobabilityofsuccess,toogreatashareofitisapttogotothemofits
ownaccord.
1225 [19] But though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning G.ed.p563
such projects has always been extremely unfavourable, that of human
avidity has commonly been quite otherwise. The same passion which has
suggestedtosomanypeopletheabsurdideaofthephilosopher’sstone,has
suggested to others the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of gold
andsilver. Theydidnotconsiderthatthevalueofthosemetalshas,inall
agesandnations,arisenchieflyfromtheirscarcity,andthattheirscarcity
has arisen from the very small quantities of them which nature has any-
where deposited in one place, from the hard and intractable substances
with which she has almost everywhere surrounded those small quantit-
ies, and consequently from the labour and expense which are everywhere
necessary in order to penetrate to and get at them. They flattered them-
selves that veins of those metals might in many places be found as large
and as abundant as those which are commonly found of lead, or copper,
or tin, or iron. The dream of Sir Walter Raleigh concerning the golden
city and country of Eldorado, may satisfy us that even wise men are not
always exempt from such strange delusions. More than a hundred years
after the death of that great man, the Jesuit Gumila was still convinced
oftherealityofthatwonderfulcountry,andexpressedwithgreatwarmth,
andIdaretosaywithgreatsincerity,howhappyheshouldbetocarrythe
light of the gospel to a people who could so well reward the pious labours
oftheirmissionary.
1226 [20] In the countries first discovered by the Spaniards, no gold or silver
mines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the work-
ing. The quantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said
to have found there had probably been very much magnified, as well as
the fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the first
discovery. What those adventurers were reported to have found, however,
was sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their countrymen. Every Span-
iardwhosailedtoAmericaexpectedtofindanEldorado. Fortune,too,did
upon this what she has done upon very few other occasions. She realized G.ed.p564
insomemeasuretheextravaganthopesofhervotaries,andinthediscov-
ery and conquest of Mexico and Peru (of which the one happened about
thirty, the other about forty years after the first expedition of Columbus),
she presented them with something not very unlike that profusion of the

years after the first settlement of the Brazils before any silver, gold, or

Companies, totheCouncilofPlymouth, etc., thisfifthwasaccordinglyre-

those first settlers, too, joined that of discovering a northwest passage to
theEastIndies. Theyhavehithertobeendisappointedinboth.
PART SECOND
Causes of Prosperity of New Colonies
1229 [1] THE colony of a civilised nation which takes possession either of a waste
country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place to
thenewsettlers,advancesmorerapidlytowealthandgreatnessthanany
otherhumansociety.
1230 [2] The colonists carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of
other useful arts superior to what can grow up of its own accord in the
courseofmanycenturiesamongsavageandbarbarousnations. Theycarry
out with them, too, the habit of subordination, some notion of the regular G.ed.p565
government which takes place in their own country, of the system of laws
whichsupportit, andofaregularadministrationofjustice; andtheynat-
urally establish something of the same kind in the new settlement. But
amongsavageandbarbarousnations,thenaturalprogressoflawandgov-
ernment is still slower than the natural progress of arts, after law and
government have been go far established as is necessary for their protec-
tion. Everycolonistgetsmorelandthanhecanpossiblycultivate. Hehas
no rent, and scarce any taxes to pay. No landlord shares with him in its
produce, and the share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle. He has
every motive to render as great as possible a produce, which is thus to be
almostentirelyhisown. Buthislandiscommonlysoextensivethat,with
all his own industry, and with all the industry of other people whom he
can get to employ, he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of what
it is capable of producing. He is eager, therefore, to collect labourers from
all quarters, and to reward them with the most liberal wages. But those
liberalwages,joinedtotheplentyandcheapnessofland,soonmakethose
437 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
labourers leave him, in order to become landlords themselves, and to re-
ward, with equal liberality, other labourers, who soon leave them for the
samereasonthattheylefttheirfirstmaster. Theliberalrewardoflabour
encouragesmarriage. Thechildren,duringthetenderyearsofinfancy,are
wellfedandproperlytakencareof,andwhentheyaregrownup,thevalue
of their labour greatly overpays their maintenance. When arrived at ma-
turity, the high price of labour, and the low price of land, enable them to
establishthemselvesinthesamemannerastheirfathersdidbeforethem.
1231 [3] In other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior
orders of people oppress the inferior one. But in new colonies the interest
ofthetwosuperiorordersobligesthemtotreattheinferioronewithmore
generosityandhumanity;atleastwherethatinferioroneisnotinastate
ofslavery. Wastelandsof thegreatest natural fertilityare to behad fora
trifle. Theincreaseofrevenuewhichtheproprietor,whoisalwaystheun-
dertaker, expects from their improvement, constitutes his profit which in
these circumstances is commonly very great. But this great profit cannot G.ed.p566
bemadewithoutemployingthelabourofotherpeopleinclearingandcul-
tivating the land; and the disproportion between the great extent of the
land and the small number of the people, which commonly takes place in
new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get this labour. He does not,
therefore, dispute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any
price. Thehighwagesoflabourencouragepopulation. Thecheapnessand
plenty of good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to
pay those high wages. In those wages consists almost the whole price of
theland;andthoughtheyarehighconsideredasthewagesoflabour,they
are low considered as the price of what is so very valuable. What encour-
ages the progress of population and improvement encourages that of real
wealthandgreatness.
1232 [4] TheprogressofmanyoftheancientGreekcoloniestowardswealthand
greatness seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the course of
a century or two, several of them appear to have rivalled, and even to
have surpassed their mother cities. Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily,
Tarentum and Locri in Italy, Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear
by all accounts to have been at least equal to any of the cities of ancient
Greece. Thoughposteriorintheirestablishment,yetalltheartsofrefine-
ment, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence seem to have been cultivated as
early, and to have been improved as highly in them as in any part of the
mother country. The schools of the two oldest Greek philosophers, those
of Thales and Pythagoras, were established, it is remarkable, not in an- G.ed.p567
cient Greece, but the one in an Asiatic, the other in an Italian colony. All
thosecolonieshadestablishedthemselvesincountriesinhabitedbysavage
andbarbarousnations,whoeasilygaveplacetothenewsettlers. Theyhad
plentyofgoodland,andastheywerealtogetherindependentofthemother
city,theywereatlibertytomanagetheirownaffairsinthewaythatthey
judgedwasmostsuitabletotheirowninterest.
438 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1233 [5] The history of the Roman colonies is by no means so brilliant. Some
of them, indeed, such as Florence, have in the course of many ages, and
after the fall of the mother city, grown up to be considerable states. But
the progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid. They
wereallestablishedinconqueredprovinces,whichinmostcaseshadbeen
fully inhabited before. The quantity of land assigned to each colonist was
seldom very considerable, and as the colony was not independent, they
were not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way they
judgedwasmostsuitabletotheirowninterest.
1234 [6] Intheplentyofgoodland,theEuropeancoloniesestablishedinAmer-
ica and the West Indies resemble, and even greatly surpass, those of an-
cient Greece. In their dependency upon the mother state, they resemble
those of ancient Rome; but their great distance from Europe has in all of
themalleviatedmoreorlesstheeffectsofthisdependency. Theirsituation
hasplacedthemlessintheviewandlessinthepoweroftheirmothercoun-
try. Inpursuingtheirinteresttheirownway,theirconducthas,uponmany
occasions,beenoverlooked,eitherbecausenotknownornotunderstoodin
Europe; and upon some occasions it has been fairly suffered and submit-
ted to, because their distance rendered it difficult to restrain it. Even the
violentandarbitrarygovernmentofSpainhas,uponmanyoccasions,been
obliged to recall or soften the orders which had been given for the gov-
ernment of her colonies for fear of a general insurrection. The progress
of all the European colonies in wealth, population, and improvement, has
accordinglybeenverygreat.

enuefromitscoloniesfromthemomentoftheirfirstestablishment. Itwas

of their mother country, while those of the other European nations were G.ed.p568
foralongtimeinagreatmeasureneglected. Theformerdidnot,perhaps,
thrivethebetterinconsequenceofthisattention;northelattertheworse
in consequence of this neglect. In proportion to the extent of the country
which they in some measure possess, the Spanish colonies are considered
as less populous and thriving than those of almost any other European
nation. TheprogressevenoftheSpanishcolonies, however, inpopulation
and improvement, has certainly been very rapid and very great. The city
ofLima,foundedsincetheconquest,isrepresentedbyUlloaascontaining
fifty thousand inhabitants near thirty years ago. Quito, which had been
but a miserable hamlet of Indians, is represented by the same author as
in his time equally populous. Gemelli Carreri, a pretended traveller, it is
said, indeed, but who seems everywhere to have written upon extremely
good information, represents the city of Mexico as containing a hundred
thousandinhabitants;anumberwhich,inspiteofalltheexaggerationsof
the Spanish writers, is, probably, more than five times greater than what
439 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
it contained in the time of Montezuma. These numbers exceed greatly
those of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, the three greatest cities of
the English colonies. Before the conquest of the Spaniards there were no
cattle fit for draught either in Mexico or Peru. The llama was their only
beast of burden, and its strength seems to have been a good deal inferior
to that of a common ass. The plough was unknown among them. They
wereignorantoftheuseofiron. Theyhadnocoinedmoney,noranyestab-
lished instrument of commerce of any kind. Their commerce was carried
onbybarter. Asortofwoodenspadewastheirprincipalinstrumentofag-
riculture. Sharp stones served them for knives and hatchets to cut with;
fishbonesandthehardsinewsofcertainanimalsservedthemforneedles

trade. In this state of things, it seems impossible that either of those em-

before: andthepeoplearesurelyverydifferent;forwemustacknowledge,

1236 [8] AfterthesettlementsoftheSpaniards,thatofthePortugueseinBrazil
is the oldest of any European nation in America. But as for a long time
afterthefirstdiscoveryneithergoldnorsilvermineswerefoundinit,and
as it afforded, upon that account, little or no revenue to the crown, it was
foralongtimeinagreatmeasureneglected;andduringthisstateofneg-
lectitgrewuptobeagreatandpowerfulcolony. WhilePortugalwasunder
thedominionofSpain, BrazilwasattackedbytheDutch, whogotposses-
sionofsevenofthefourteenprovincesintowhichitisdivided. Theyexpec-
tedsoontoconquertheotherseven,whenPortugalrecovereditsindepend-
ency by the elevation of the family of Braganza to the throne. The Dutch
then,asenemiestotheSpaniards,becamefriendstothePortuguese,who
were likewise the enemies of the Spaniards. They agreed, therefore, to
leavethatpartofBrazil,whichtheyhadnotconquered,totheKingofPor-
tugal,whoagreedtoleavethatpartwhichtheyhadconqueredtothem,as
a matter not worth disputing about with such good allies. But the Dutch
government soon began to oppress the Portuguese colonists, who, instead
ofamusingthemselveswithcomplaints,tookarmsagainsttheirnewmas-
ters,andbytheirownvalourandresolution,withtheconnivance,indeed,
but without any avowed assistance from the mother country, drove them
out of Brazil. The Dutch, therefore, finding it impossible to keep any part
ofthecountrytothemselves,werecontentedthatitshouldbeentirelyre-
stored to the crown of Portugal. In this colony there are said to be more
440 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
than six hundred thousand people, either Portuguese or descended from
Portuguese,creoles,mulattoes,andamixedracebetweenPortugueseand
Brazilians. No one colony in America is supposed to contain so great a
numberofpeopleofEuropeanextraction.
1237 [9] Towards the end of the fifteenth, and during the greater part of the
sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal were the two great naval powers
upontheocean;forthoughthecommerceofVeniceextendedtoeverypart
ofEurope,itsfleetshadscarceeversailedbeyondtheMediterranean. The
Spaniards, in virtue of the first discovery, claimed all America as their
own; and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as that of
PortugalfromsettlinginBrazil,suchwas,atthattime,theterroroftheir
name, that the greater part of the other nations of Europe were afraid to
establishthemselvesinanyotherpartofthatgreatcontinent. TheFrench,
who attempted to settle in Florida, were all murdered by the Spaniards.
Butthedeclensionofthenavalpowerofthislatternation,inconsequence
of the defeat or miscarriage of what they called their Invincible Armada,
which happened towards the end of the sixteenth century, put it out of
their power to obstruct any longer the settlements of the other European G.ed.p570
nations. In the course of the seventeenth century, therefore, the English,
French,Dutch,Danes,andSwedes,allthegreatnationswhohadanyports
upontheocean,attemptedtomakesomesettlementsinthenewworld.
1238 [10] The Swedes established themselves in New Jersey; and the number
of Swedish families still to be found there sufficiently demonstrates that
thiscolonywasverylikelytoprosperhaditbeenprotectedbythemother
country. But being neglected by Sweden, it was soon swallowed up by the
Dutch colony of New York, which again, in 1674, fell under the dominion
oftheEnglish.
1239 [11] The small islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz are the only coun-
triesinthenewworldthathaveeverbeenpossessedBytheDanes. These
little settlements, too, were under the government of an exclusive com-
pany, which had the sole right, both of purchasing the surplus produce of
thecolonists,andofsupplyingthemwithsuchgoodsofothercountriesas
they wanted, and which, therefore, both in its purchases and sales, had
not only the power of oppressing them, but the greatest temptation to do
so. Thegovernmentofanexclusivecompanyofmerchantsis,perhaps,the
worst of all governments for any country whatever. It was not, however,
abletostopaltogethertheprogressofthesecolonies,thoughitrenderedit
moreslowandlanguid. ThelateKingofDenmarkdissolvedthiscompany,
andsincethattimetheprosperityofthesecolonieshasbeenverygreat.
1240 [12] TheDutchsettlementsintheWest,aswellasthoseintheEastIndies,
were originally put under the government of an exclusive company. The
progress of some of them, therefore, though it has been considerable, in
comparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled
andestablished,hasbeenlanguidandslowincomparisonwiththatofthe
greater part of new colonies. The colony of Surinam, though very consid-
441 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
erable,isstillinferiortothegreaterpartofthesugarcoloniesoftheother
European nations. The colony of Nova Belgia, now divided into the two
provincesofNewYorkandNewJersey,wouldprobablyhavesoonbecome

the company allows all Dutch ships to trade to Surinam upon paying two G.ed.p571

serves to itself exclusively the direct trade from Africa to America, which

of prosperity which that colony at present enjoys. Curacoa and Eustatia,

ports are open to those of one nation only, has been the great cause of the
prosperityofthosetwobarrenislands.
[13] The French colony of Canada was, during the greater part of the last
1241
century, and some part of the present, under the government of an ex-
clusive company. Under so unfavourable an administration its progress
was necessarily very slow in comparison with that of other new colonies;
but it became much more rapid when this company was dissolved after
the fall of what is called the Mississippi scheme. When the English got
possession of this country, they found in it near double the number of in-
habitantswhichFatherCharlevoixhadassignedtoitbetweentwentyand
thirtyyearsbefore. ThatJesuithadtravelledoverthewholecountry,and

[14] TheFrenchcolonyofSt.Domingowasestablishedbypiratesandfree-
1242
booters,who,foralongtime,neitherrequiredtheprotection,noracknow-
ledged the authority of France; and when that race of banditti became so
far citizens as to acknowledge this authority, it was for a long time ne-
cessary to exercise it with very great gentleness. During this period the
population and improvement of this colony increased very fast. Even the
oppressionoftheexclusivecompany,towhichitwasforsometimesubjec-
ted,withalltheothercoloniesofFrance,thoughitnodoubtretarded,had
not been able to stop its progress altogether. The course of its prosperity
returned as soon as it was relieved from that oppression. It is now the
mostimportantofthesugarcoloniesoftheWestIndies,anditsproduceis

TheothersugarcoloniesofFranceareingeneralallverythriving.
1243 [15] But there are no colonies of which the progress has been more rapid
thanthatoftheEnglishinNorthAmerica.
1244 [16] Plenty of good land, and liberty to manage their own affairs their own G.ed.p572
442 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
way,seemtobethetwogreatcausesoftheprosperityofallnewcolonies.
1245 [17] In the plenty of good land the English colonies of North America,
though no doubt very abundantly provided, are however inferior to those
of the Spaniards and Portuguese, and not superior to some of those pos-
sessed by the French before the late war. But the political institutions of
the English colonies have been more favourable to the improvement and
cultivationofthislandthanthoseofanyoftheotherthreenations.
1246 [18] First, the engrossing of uncultivated land, though it has by no means
beenpreventedaltogether,hasbeenmorerestrainedintheEnglishcolon-
iesthaninanyother. Thecolonylawwhichimposesuponeveryproprietor
the obligation of improving and cultivating, within a limited time, a cer-
tain proportion of his lands, and which in case of failure, declares those
neglectedlandsgrantabletoanyotherperson,thoughithasnot,perhaps,
beenverystrictlyexecuted,has,however,hadsomeeffect.
1247 [19] Secondly,inPennsylvaniathereisnorightofprimogeniture,andlands,
likemovables,aredividedequallyamongallthechildrenofthefamily. In
threeoftheprovincesofNewEnglandtheoldesthasonlyadoubleshare,
as in the Mosaical law. Though in those provinces, therefore, too great a
quantityoflandshouldsometimesbeengrossedbyaparticularindividual,
it is likely, in the course of a generation or two, to be sufficiently divided
again. In the other English colonies, indeed, the right of primogeniture
takes place, as in the law of England. But in all the English colonies the
tenureofthelands,whichareallheldbyfreesocage,facilitatesalienation,
andthegranteeofanyextensivetractoflandgenerallyfindsitforhisin-
teresttoalienate,asfastashecan,thegreaterpartofit,reservingonlya

rightofMajorazzo1 takesplaceinthesuccessionofallthosegreatestates
towhichanytitleofhonourisannexed. Suchestatesgoalltooneperson,
and are in effect entailed and unalienable. The French colonies, indeed,
are subject to the custom of Paris, which, in the inheritance of land, is
much more favourable to the younger children than the law of England.
But in the French colonies, if any part of an estate, held by the noble ten-
ureofchivalryandhomage,isalienated,itis,foralimitedtime,subjectto
therightofredemption,eitherbytheheirofthesuperiororbytheheirof

tenures, which necessarily embarrass alienation. But in a new colony a
greatuncultivatedestateislikelytobemuchmorespeedilydividedbyali- G.ed.p573
enationthanbysuccession. Theplentyandcheapnessofgoodland,ithas
already been observed, are the principal causes of the rapid prosperity of
new colonies. The engrossing of land, in effect, destroys this plenty and
cheapness. The engrossing of uncultivated land, besides, is the greatest
obstructiontoitsimprovement. Butthelabourthatisemployedintheim-
provement and cultivation of land affords the greatest and most valuable
1[Smith]JusMajoratus.
443 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
produce to the society. The produce of labour, in this case, pays not only
itsownwages,andtheprofitofthestockwhichemploysit,buttherentof
the land too upon which it is employed. The labour of the English colon-
ists, therefore, being more employed in the improvement and cultivation
of land, is likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce than that
ofanyoftheotherthreenations,which,bytheengrossingofland,ismore
orlessdivertedtowardsotheremployments.
1248 [20] Thirdly,thelabouroftheEnglishcolonistsisnotonlylikelytoafforda
greaterandmorevaluableproduce,but,inconsequenceofthemoderation
of their taxes, a greater proportion of this produce belongs to themselves,
whichtheymaystoreupandemployinputtingintomotionastillgreater
quantity of labour. The English colonists have never yet contributed any-
thing towards the defence of the mother country, or towards the support
of its civil government. They themselves, on the contrary, have hitherto
been defended almost entirely at the expense of the mother country. But
the expense of fleets and armies is out of all proportion greater than the
necessaryexpenseofcivilgovernment. Theexpenseoftheirowncivilgov-
ernment has always been very moderate. It has generally been confined
to what was necessary for paying competent salaries to the governor, to
the judges, and to some other officers of police, and for maintaining a few
of the most useful public works. The expense of the civil establishment
of Massachusetts Bay, before the commencement of the present disturb-
ances, used to be but about 18,000l. a year. That of New Hampshire and
Rhode Island, 3,500l. each. That of Connecticut, 4,000l. That of New York
and Pennsylvania, 4,500l. each. That of New Jersey, 1,200l. That of Vir-
ginia and South Carolina, 8,000l. each. The civil establishments of Nova
ScotiaandGeorgiaarepartlysupportedbyanannualgrantofParliament.
But Nova Scotia pays, besides, about 7,000l. a year towards the public ex- G.ed.p574
pensesofthecolony;andGeorgiaabout2,500l.ayear. Allthedifferentcivil
establishmentsinNorthAmerica,inshort,exclusiveofthoseofMaryland
andNorthCarolina,ofwhichnoexactaccounthasbeengot,didnot,before
thecommencementofthepresentdisturbances,costtheinhabitantsabove
64,700l.ayear;anever-memorableexampleathowsmallanexpensethree
millionsofpeoplemaynotonlybegoverned, butwellgoverned. Themost
important part of the expense of government, indeed, that of defence and
protection, has constantly fallen upon the mother country. The ceremo-
nial, too, of the civil government in the colonies, upon the reception of
a new governor, upon the opening of a new assembly, etc., though suffi-
ciently decent, is not accompanied with any expensive pomp or parade.
Their ecclesiastical government is conducted upon a plan equally frugal.
Tithesareunknownamongthem;andtheirclergy,whoarefarfrombeing
numerous, are maintained either by moderate stipends, or by the volun-
tary contributions of the people. The power of Spain and Portugal, on the
contrary, derives some support from the taxes levied upon their colonies.
France,indeed,hasneverdrawnanyconsiderablerevenuefromitscolon-
444 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ies,thetaxeswhichitleviesuponthembeinggenerallyspentamongthem.
But the colony government of all these three nations is conducted upon a
much more expensive ceremonial. The sums spent upon the reception of
a new viceroy of Peru, for example, have frequently been enormous. Such
ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich colonists upon those
particular occasions, but they serve to introduce among them the habit of
vanityandexpenseuponallotheroccasions. Theyarenotonlyverygriev-
ous occasional taxes, but they contribute to establish perpetual taxes of
thesamekindstillmoregrievous;theruinoustaxesofprivateluxuryand
extravagance. Inthecoloniesofallthosethreenationstoo,theecclesiast-
ical government is extremely oppressive. Tithes take place in all of them,
and are levied with the utmost rigour in those of Spain and Portugal. All
of them, besides, are oppressed with a numerous race of mendicant fri-
ars,whosebeggarybeingnotonlylicensedbutconsecratedbyreligion,isa

1249 [21] Fourthly, in the disposal of their surplus produce, or of what is over
and above their own consumption, the English colonies have been more
favoured, and have been allowed a more extensive market, than those of G.ed.p575
anyotherEuropeannation. EveryEuropeannationhasendeavouredmore

nation. But the manner in which this monopoly has been exercised in
differentnationshasbeenverydifferent.
1250 [22] Some nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to
an exclusive company, of whom the colonists were obliged to buy all such
Europeangoodsastheywanted,andtowhomtheywereobligedtosellthe
whole of their own surplus produce. It was the interest of the company,
therefore,notonlytoselltheformerasdear,andtobuythelatterascheap
as possible, but to buy no more of the latter, even at this low price than
what they could dispose of for a very high price in Europe. It was their
interest, not only to degrade in all cases the value of the surplus produce
of the colony, but in many cases to discourage and keep down the natural
increase of its quantity. Of all the expedients that can well be contrived
to stunt the natural growth of a new colony, that of an exclusive company
is undoubtedly the most effectual. This, however, has been the policy of
Holland, though their company, in the course of the present century, has
given up in many respects the exertion of their exclusive privilege. This,
too, was the policy of Denmark till the reign of the late king. It has occa-
sionallybeenthepolicyofFrance,andoflate,since1755,afterithadbeen
abandoned by all other nations on account of its absurdity, it has become
445 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
thepolicyofPortugalwithregardatleasttotwooftheprincipalprovinces
ofBrazil,FernambucoandMarannon.
1251 [23] Other nations, without establishing an exclusive company, have con-
fined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of the
mother country, from whence no ship was allowed to sail, but either in
afleetandataparticularseason,or,ifsingle,inconsequenceofaparticu-
larlicence,whichinmostcaseswasverywellpaidfor. Thispolicyopened,
indeed, the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother country,
providedtheytradedfromtheproperport,attheproperseason,andinthe
propervessels. Butasallthedifferentmerchants,whojoinedtheirstocks G.ed.p576
in order to fit out those licensed vessels, would find it for their interest to
act in concert, the trade which was carried on in this manner would ne-
cessarily be conducted very nearly upon the same principles as that of an
exclusivecompany. Theprofitofthosemerchantswouldbealmostequally
exorbitant and oppressive. The colonies would be ill supplied, and would
beobligedbothtobuyverydear,andtosellverycheap. This,however,till
withinthesefewyears,hadalwaysbeenthepolicyofSpain,andtheprice
of all European goods, accordingly, is said to have been enormous in the
Spanish West Indies. At Quito, we are told by Ulloa, a pound of iron sold
for about four and sixpence, and a pound of steel for about six and nine-
pence sterling. But it is chiefly in order to purchase European goods that
thecoloniespartwiththeirownproduce. Themore,therefore,theypayfor
the one, the less they really get for the other, and the dearness of the one
is the same thing with the cheapness of the other. The policy of Portugal
isinthisrespectthesameastheancientpolicyofSpainwithregardtoall
its colonies, except Fernambuco and Marannon, and with regard to these
ithaslatelyadoptedastillworse.

ferenttradersrendersitimpossibleforthemtoenterintoanygeneralcom-
bination, and their competition is sufficient to hinder them from making
very exorbitant profits. Under so liberal a policy the colonies are enabled
bothtoselltheirownproduceandtobuythegoodsofEuropeatareason-
able price. But since the dissolution of the Plymouth Company, when our
colonies were but in their infancy, this has always been the policy of Eng-
land. Ithasgenerally,too,beenthatofFrance,andhasbeenuniformlyso

1256 [28] In a country quite covered with wood, where timber consequently is
of little or no value, the expense of clearing the ground is the principal
obstacletoimprovement. Byallowingthecoloniesaveryextensivemarket
for their lumber, the law endeavours to facilitate improvement by raising
the price of a commodity which would otherwise be of little value, and
thereby enabling them to make some profit of what would otherwise be a
mereexpense.
1257 [29] In a country neither half-peopled nor half-cultivated, cattle naturally
multiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants, and are often upon
that account of little or no value. But it is necessary, it has already been
shown, that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to that of
corn before the greater part of the lands of any country can be improved.
ByallowingtoAmericancattle,inallshapes,deadoralive,averyextens-

liberty,however,mustbesomewhatdiminishedbythe4thofGeorgeIII,c.

1258 [30] To increase the shipping and naval power of Great Britain, by the ex-
tension of the fisheries of our colonies, is an object which the legislature
seems to have had almost constantly in view. Those fisheries, upon this G.ed.p578
account, have had all the encouragement which freedom can give them,
and they have flourished accordingly. The New England fishery in partic-
ularwas,beforethelatedisturbances,oneofthemostimportant,perhaps,
in the world. The whale-fishery which, notwithstanding an extravagant
bounty, isin Great Britain carried on toso little purpose that in theopin-

great extent. Fish is one of the principal articles with which the North
AmericanstradetoSpain,Portugal,andtheMediterranean.
1259 [31] Sugar was originally an enumerated commodity which could be expor-
tedonlytoGreatBritain. Butin1731,uponarepresentationofthesugar-
planters, its exportation was permitted to all parts of the world. The re-
strictions,however,withwhichthislibertywasgranted,joinedtothehigh

1261 [33] If the whole surplus produce of America in grain of all sorts, in salt
provisions and in fish, had been put into the enumeration, and thereby
forcedintothemarketofGreatBritain,itwouldhaveinterferedtoomuch
withtheproduceoftheindustryofourownpeople. Itwasprobablynotso
muchfromanyregardtotheinterestofAmericaasfromajealousyofthis
interference that those important commodities have not only been kept
out of the enumeration, but that the importation into Great Britain of all
grain, except rice, and of salt provisions, has, in the ordinary state of the
law,beenprohibited.
1262 [34] The non-enumerated commodities could originally be exported to all G.ed.p579
parts of the world. Lumber and rice, having been once put into the enu-
meration, when they were afterwards taken out of it, were confined, as to
the European market, to the countries that lie south of Cape Finisterre.
Bythe6thofGeorgeIII.c.52,allnon-enumeratedcommoditiesweresub-
jected to the like restriction. The parts of Europe which lie south of Cape
Finisterre are not manufacturing countries, and we were less jealous of
the colony ships carrying home from them any manufactures which could
interferewithourown.
1263 [35] Theenumeratedcommoditiesareoftwosorts: first, suchasareeither
the peculiar produce of America, or as cannot be produced, or at least
are not produced, in the mother country. Of this kind are molasses, cof-
fee, cocoa-nuts, tobacco, pimento, ginger, whalefins, raw silk, cotton-wool,
beaver,andotherpeltryofAmerica,indigo,fustic,andotherdyeingwoods;
secondly, such as are not the peculiar produce of America, but which are

andskins,potandpearlashes. Thelargestimportationofcommoditiesof

any part of the produce of the mother country. By confining them to the
homemarket,ourmerchants,itwasexpected,wouldnotonlybeenabledto

betterprofitathome,buttoestablishbetweentheplantationsandforeign
countriesanadvantageouscarryingtrade,ofwhichGreatBritainwasne-
cessarilytobethecentreoremporium,astheEuropeancountryintowhich
those commodities were first to be imported. The importation of commod-
ities of the second kind might be so managed too, it was supposed, as to
interfere,notwiththesaleofthoseofthesamekindwhichwereproduced
at home, but with that of those which were imported from foreign coun-
tries; because, by means of proper duties, they might be rendered always
somewhat dearer than the former, and yet a good deal cheaper than the
latter. By confining such commodities to the home market, therefore, it
wasproposedtodiscouragetheproduce, not ofGreat Britain, butofsome
foreigncountrieswithwhichthebalanceoftradewasbelievedtobeunfa-
vourabletoGreatBritain.
1264 [36] The prohibition of exporting from the colonies, to any other country
but Great Britain, masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpen-
tine, naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies, and G.ed.p580
consequentlytoincreasetheexpenseofclearingtheirlands, theprincipal
obstacletotheirimprovement. Butaboutthebeginningofthepresentcen-
tury, in 1703, the pitch and tar company of Sweden endeavoured to raise
thepriceoftheircommoditiestoGreatBritain,byprohibitingtheirexport-
ation,exceptintheirownships,attheirownprice,andinsuchquantities
as they thought proper. In order to counteract this notable piece of mer-
cantile policy, and to render herself as much as possible independent, not
onlyofSweden,butofalltheothernorthernpowers,GreatBritaingavea
bounty upon the importation of naval stores from America, and the effect
ofthisbountywastoraisethepriceoftimberinAmericamuchmorethan
theconfinementtothehomemarketcouldlowerit;andasbothregulations
were enacted at the same time, their joint effect was rather to encourage
thantodiscouragetheclearingoflandinAmerica.
1265 [37] Though pig and bar iron too have been put among the enumerated
commodities, yet as, when imported from America, they were exempted
from considerable duties to which they are subject when imported from
any other country, the one part of the regulation contributes more to en-
couragetheerectionoffurnacesinAmericathantheothertodiscourageit.
There is no manufacture which occasions so great a consumption of wood
asafurnace, orwhichcancontributesomuchtotheclearingofacountry
overgrownwithit.
1266 [38] The tendency of some of these regulations to raise the value of timber
inAmerica, andtherebytofacilitatetheclearingoftheland, wasneither,
perhaps, intended nor understood by the legislature. Though their bene-
ficial effects, however, have been in this respect accidental, they have not
uponthataccountbeenlessreal.
449 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1267 [39] The most perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the British
colonies of America and the West Indies, both in the enumerated and in
the non-enumerated commodities. Those colonies are now become so pop-
ulousandthrivingthateachofthemfindsinsomeoftheothersagreatand
extensivemarketforeverypartofitsproduce. Allofthemtakentogether,
theymakeagreatinternalmarketfortheproduceofoneanother.
1268 [40] The liberality of England, however, towards the trade of her colonies G.ed.p581
has been confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce,
either in its rude state, or in what may be called the very first stage of
manufacture. The more advanced or more refined manufactures even of
the colony produce, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain
choose to reserve to themselves, and have prevailed upon the legislature
to prevent their establishment in the colonies, sometimes by high duties,
andsometimesbyabsoluteprohibitions.
1269 [41] While, for example, Muskovado sugars from the British plantations
pay upon importation only 6s.4d. the hundredweight; white sugars pay
1l.1s.1d.; and refined, either double or single, in loaves 4l.2s.5 8 d. When
20
those high duties were imposed, Great Britain was the sole, and she still
continues to be the principal market to which the sugars of the British
colonies could be exported. They amounted, therefore, to a prohibition, at
first of claying or refining sugar for any foreign market, and at present of
claying or refining it for the market, which takes off, perhaps, more than
nine-tenths of the whole produce. The manufacture of claying or refin-
ing sugar accordingly, though it has flourished in all the sugar colonies of
France,hasbeenlittlecultivatedinanyofthoseofEnglandexceptforthe
market of the colonies themselves. While Grenada was in the hands of
the French there was a refinery of sugar, by claying at least, upon almost
every plantation. Since it fell into those of the English, almost all works
of this kind have been given tip, and there are at present, October 1773,
I am assured not above two or three remaining in the island. At present,
however, by an indulgence of the custom-house, clayed or refined sugar, if G.ed.p582
reducedfromloavesintopowder,iscommonlyimportedasMuskovado.
1270 [42] While Great Britain encourages in America the manufactures of pig
andbariron,byexemptingthemfromdutiestowhichthelikecommodities
aresubjectwhenimportedfromanyothercountry,sheimposesanabsolute
prohibition upon the erection of steel furnaces and slitmills in any of her
American plantations. She will not suffer her colonists to work in those
more refined manufactures even for their own consumption; but insists
upon their purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods of
thiskindwhichtheyhaveoccasionfor.
1271 [43] She prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water,
andeventhecarriagebylanduponhorsebackorinacart,ofhats,ofwools
and woollen goods, of the produce of America; a regulation which effectu-
ally prevents the establishment of any manufacture of such commodities
for distant sale, and confines the industry of her colonists in this way to
450 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
such coarse and household manufactures as a private family commonly
makes for its own use or for that of some of its neighbours in the same
province.
1272 [44] To prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of
everypartoftheirownproduce,orfromemployingtheirstockandindustry
inthewaythattheyjudgemostadvantageoustothemselves,isamanifest
violation of the most sacred rights of mankind. Unjust, however, as such

ies. Landisstillsocheap, and, consequently, laboursodearamongthem,
thattheycanimportfromthemothercountryalmostallthemorerefined
or more advanced manufactures cheaper than they could make for them-
selves. Thoughtheyhadnot, therefore, beenprohibitedfromestablishing
such manufactures, yet in their present state of improvement a regard to
their own interest would, probably, have prevented them from doing so.

1273 [45] Great Britain too, as she confines to her own market some of the most G.ed.p583
importantproductionsofthecolonies,soincompensationshegivestosome
of them an advantage in that market, sometimes by imposing higher du-
ties upon the like productions when imported from other countries, and
sometimesbygivingbountiesupontheirimportationfromthecolonies. In
the first way she gives an advantage in the home market to the sugar, to-
bacco, and iron of her own colonies, and in the second to their raw silk,
to their hemp and flax, to their indigo, to their naval stores, and to their
building timber. This second way of encouraging the colony produce by
bountiesuponimportation,is,sofarasIhavebeenabletolearn,peculiar
to Great Britain. The first is not. Portugal does not content herself with
imposing higher duties upon the importation of tobacco from any other
country,butprohibitsitundertheseverestpenalties.
1274 [46] WithregardtotheimportationofgoodsfromEurope,Englandhaslike-
wisedealtmoreliberallywithhercoloniesthananyothernation.
1275 [47] Great Britain allows a part, almost always the half, generally a lar-
ger portion, and sometimes the whole of the duty which is paid upon the
importation of foreign goods, to be drawn back upon their exportation to
any foreign country. No independent foreign country, it was easy to fore-
see, would receive them if they came to it loaded with the heavy duties
to which almost all foreign goods are subjected on their importation into
GreatBritain. Unless,therefore,somepartofthosedutieswasdrawnback
uponexportation,therewasanendofthecarryingtrade;atradesomuch

1276 [48] Ourcolonies,however,arebynomeansindependentforeigncountries;

ingthemwithallgoodsfromEurope,mighthaveforcedthem(inthesame
mannerasothercountrieshavedonetheircolonies)toreceivesuchgoods,
loaded with all the same duties which they paid in the mother country.
But, on the contrary, till 1763, the same drawbacks were paid upon the
exportationofthegreaterpartofforeigngoodstoourcoloniesastoanyin-
dependentforeigncountry. In1763,indeed,bythe4thofGeorgeIII.c.15.
thisindulgencewasagooddealabated,anditwasenacted,‘Thatnopartof
thedutycalledtheOldSubsidyshouldbedrawnbackforanygoodsofthe

in America; wines, white calicoes and muslins excepted.’ Before this law,
many different sorts of foreign goods might have been bought cheaper in G.ed.p584
theplantationsthaninthemothercountry;andsomemaystill.
1277 [49] Of the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade, the
merchantswhocarryiton,itmustbeobserved,havebeentheprincipalad-
visers. Wemustnotwonder,therefore,if,inthegreaterpartofthem,their
interest has been more considered than either that of the colonies or that
of the mother country. In their exclusive privilege of supplying the colon-
ies with all the goods which they wanted from Europe, and of purchasing
all such parts of their surplus produce as could not interfere with any of
the trades which they themselves carried on at home, the interest of the
colonies was sacrificed to the interest of those merchants. In allowing the
same drawbacks upon the re-exportation of the greater part of European
and East India goods to the colonies as upon their re-exportation to any
independent country, the interest of the mother country was sacrificed to
it, even according to the mercantile ideas of that interest. It was for the
interest of the merchants to pay as little as possible for the foreign which
they sent to the colonies, and, consequently, to get back as much as pos-
sibleofthedutieswhichtheyadvancedupontheirimportationintoGreat
Britain. They might thereby be enabled to sell in the colonies either the
samequantityofgoodswithagreaterprofit,oragreaterquantitywiththe
sameprofit,and,consequently,togainsomethingeitherintheonewayor
the other. It was likewise for the interest of the colonies to get all such
goods ascheap andin as greatabundance as possible. But this mightnot
alwaysbefortheinterestofthemothercountry. Shemightfrequentlysuf-
fer both in her revenue, by giving back a great part of the duties which
had been paid upon the importation of such goods; and in her manufac-
tures,bybeingundersoldinthecolonymarket,inconsequenceoftheeasy
termsuponwhichforeignmanufacturescouldbecarriedthitherbymeans
of those drawbacks. The progress of the linen manufacture of Great Bri-
tain,itiscommonlysaid,hasbeenagooddealretardedbythedrawbacks
uponthere-exportationofGermanlinentotheAmericancolonies.
1278 [50] But though the policy of Great Britain with regard to the trade of her
colonies has been dictated by the same mercantile spirit as that of other
452 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
nations,ithas,however,uponthewhole,beenlessilliberalandoppressive
thanthatofanyofthem.
1279 [51] Ineverything,excepttheirforeigntrade,thelibertyoftheEnglishcol-
oniststomanagetheirownaffairstheirownwayiscomplete. Itisinevery G.ed.p585
respectequaltothatoftheirfellow-citizensathome,andissecuredinthe
same manner, by an assembly of the representatives of the people, who
claimthesolerightofimposingtaxesforthesupportofthecolonygovern-
ment. The authority of this assembly overawes the executive power, and
neither the meanest nor the most obnoxious colonist, as long as he obeys
the law, has anything to fear from the resentment, either of the governor
or of any other civil or military officer in the province. The colony assem-
bliesthough,liketheHouseofCommonsinEngland,arenotalwaysavery
equal representation of the people, yet they approach more nearly to that
character;andastheexecutivepowereitherhasnotthemeanstocorrupt
them,or,onaccountofthesupportwhichitreceivesfromthemothercoun-
try,isnotunderthenecessityofdoingso,theyareperhapsingeneralmore
influencedbytheinclinationsoftheirconstituents. Thecouncilswhich,in
thecolonylegislatures,correspondtotheHouseofLordsinGreatBritain,
are not composed of an hereditary nobility. In some of the colonies, as in
threeofthegovernmentsofNewEngland,thosecouncilsarenotappointed
bytheking,butchosenbytherepresentativesofthepeople. Innoneofthe
Englishcoloniesisthereanyhereditarynobility. Inallofthem,indeed,as
in all other free countries, the descendant of an old colony family is more
respected than an upstart of equal merit and fortune; but he is only more
respected,andhehasnoprivilegesbywhichhecanbetroublesometohis
neighbours. Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the
colony assemblies had not only the legislative but a part of the executive
power. InConnecticutandRhodeIsland,theyelectedthegovernor. Inthe
other colonies they appointed the revenue officers who collected the taxes
imposedbythoserespectiveassemblies,towhomthoseofficerswereimme-
diately responsible. There is more equality, therefore, among the English
colonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country. Their man-
ners are more republican, and their governments, those of three of the
provinces of New England in particular, have hitherto been more repub-
licantoo.
1280 [52] The absolute governments of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the con- G.ed.p586
trary,takeplaceintheircolonies;andthediscretionarypowerswhichsuch
governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on ac-
count of the great distance, naturally exercised there with more than or-
dinary violence. Under all absolute governments there is more liberty in
the capital than in any other part of the country. The sovereign himself
canneverhaveeitherinterestorinclinationtoperverttheorderofjustice,
ortooppressthegreatbodyofthepeople. Inthecapitalhispresenceover-
awes more or less all his inferior officers, who in the remoter provinces,
fromwhencethecomplaintsofthepeoplearelesslikelytoreachhim,can
453 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
exercise their tyranny with much more safety. But the European colon-
ies in America are more remote than the most distant provinces of the
greatest empires which had ever been known before. The government of
theEnglishcoloniesisperhapstheonlyonewhich,sincetheworldbegan,
couldgiveperfectsecuritytotheinhabitantsofsoverydistantaprovince.
The administration of the French colonies, however, has always been con-
ductedwithmoregentlenessandmoderationthanthatoftheSpanishand
Portugese. This superiority of conduct is suitable both to the character of
the French nation, and to what forms the character of every nation, the
nature of their government, which though arbitrary and violent in com-
parison with that of Great Britain, is legal and free in comparison with
thoseofSpainandPortugal.
1281 [53] It is in the progress of the North American colonies, however, that the
superiorityoftheEnglishpolicychieflyappears. Theprogressofthesugar
coloniesofFrancehasbeenatleastequal,perhapssuperior,tothatofthe
greater part of those of England, and yet the sugar colonies of England
enjoy a free government nearly of the same kind with that which takes
place in her colonies of North America. But the sugar colonies of France
arenotdiscouraged, likethoseofEngland, fromrefiningtheirownsugar;
and, what is of still greater importance, the genius of their government
naturallyintroducesabettermanagementoftheirnegroslaves.
1282 [54] In all European colonies the culture of the sugar-cane is carried on by
negro slaves. The constitution of those who have been born in the tem-
perate climate of Europe could not, it is supposed, support the labour of
digging the ground under the burning sun of the West Indies; and the
culture of the sugarcane, as it is managed at present, is all hand labour,
though, in the opinion of many, the drill plough might be introduced into
it with great advantage. But, as the profit and success of the cultivation
which is carried on by means of cattle, depend very much upon the good
managementofthosecattle,sotheprofitandsuccessofthatwhichiscar- G.ed.p587
riedonbyslavesmustdependequallyuponthegoodmanagementofthose
slaves; andinthegoodmanagementoftheirslavestheFrenchplanters,I
think it is generally allowed, are superior to the English. The law, so far
as it gives some weak protection to the slave against the violence of his
master, is likely to be better executed in a colony where the government
is in a great measure arbitrary than in one where it is altogether free. In
everycountrywheretheunfortunatelawofslaveryisestablished,thema-

wherethemasterisperhapseitheramemberofthecolonyassembly,oran

1283 [55] Thattheconditionofaslaveisbetterunderanarbitrarythanundera

tions. IntheRomanhistory,thefirsttimewereadofthemagistrateinter-
posingtoprotecttheslavefromtheviolenceofhismasterisundertheem-

with indignation, to emancipate immediately, not only that slave, but all
the others that belonged to him. Under the republic no magistrate could G.ed.p588
have had authority enough to protect the slave, much less to punish the
master.
1284 [56] The stock, it is to be observed, which has improved the sugar colonies
of France, particularly the great colony of St. Domingo, has been raised
almost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of those
colonies. It has been almost altogether the produce of the soil and of the
industry of the colonies, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of
that produce gradually accumulated by good management, and employed
in raising a still greater produce. But the stock which has improved and
cultivated the sugar colonies of England has, a great part of it, been sent
out from England, and has by no means been altogether the produce of
the soil and industry of the colonists. The prosperity of the English sugar
colonieshasbeen,inagreatmeasure,owingtothegreatrichesofEngland,
ofwhichaparthasoverflowed,ifonemaysayso,uponthosecolonies. But
the prosperity of the sugar colonies of France has been entirely owing to
thegoodconductofthecolonists,whichmustthereforehavehadsomesu-

1285 [57] Such have been the general outlines of the policy of the different
Europeannationswithregardtotheircolonies.
1286 [58] ThepolicyofEurope,therefore,hasverylittletoboastof,eitherinthe
originalestablishmentor,sofarasconcernstheirinternalgovernment,in
thesubsequentprosperityofthecoloniesofAmerica.
1287 [59] Folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided
455 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
over and directed the first project of establishing those colonies; the folly
of hunting after gold and silver mines, and the injustice of coveting the
possession of a country whose harmless natives, far from having ever in-
jured the people of Europe, had received the first adventurers with every
markofkindnessandhospitality.
1288 [60] Theadventurers,indeed,whoformedsomeofthelaterestablishments, G.ed.p589
joined to the chimerical project of finding gold and silver mines other
motives more reasonable and more laudable; but even these motives do
verylittlehonourtothepolicyofEurope.
1289 [61] TheEnglishPuritans,restrainedathome,fledforfreedomtoAmerica,
andestablishedtherethefourgovernmentsofNewEngland. TheEnglish
Catholics, treated with much greater injustice, established that of Mary-
land;theQuakers,thatofPennsylvania. ThePortugueseJews,persecuted
bytheInquisition,strippedoftheirfortunes,andbanishedtoBrazil,intro-
duced by their example some sort of order and industry among the trans-
ported felons and strumpets by whom that colony was originally peopled,
and taught them the culture of the sugar-cane. Upon all these different
occasions it was not the wisdom and policy, but the disorder and injustice
oftheEuropeangovernmentswhichpeopledandcultivatedAmerica.

PART THIRD
G.ed.p591
Of the Advantages which Europe has derived
from the Discovery of America, and from that
of a Passage to the East Indies by the Cape of
Good Hope
1293 [1] SUCHaretheadvantageswhichthecoloniesofAmericahavederivedfrom
thepolicyofEurope.
1294 [2] What are those which Europe has derived from the discovery and col-
onizationofAmerica?
1295 [3] Those advantages may be divided, first, into the general advantages
which Europe, considered as one great country, has derived from those
greatevents;and,secondly,intotheparticularadvantageswhicheachcol-
onizing country has derived from the colonies which particularly belong
to it, in consequence of the authority or dominion which it exercises over
them.
1296 [4] ThegeneraladvantageswhichEurope,consideredasonegreatcountry,
has derived from the discovery and colonisation of America, consist, first,
intheincreaseofitsenjoyments;and,secondly,intheaugmentationofits
industry.
1297 [5] The surplus produce of America, imported into Europe, furnishes the
inhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which
they could not otherwise have possessed; some for conveniency and use,
some for pleasure, and some for ornament, and thereby contributes to in-
creasetheirenjoyments.
1298 [6] The discovery and colonization of America, it will readily be allowed,
havecontributedtoaugmenttheindustry, first, ofallthecountrieswhich
trade to it directly, such as Spain, Portugal, France, and England; and,
secondly, of all those which, without trading to it directly, send, through
the medium of other countries, goods to it of their own produce; such as
Austrian Flanders, and some provinces of Germany, which, through the
457 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
mediumofthecountriesbeforementioned,sendtoitaconsiderablequant-
ity of linen and other goods. All such countries have evidently gained a
more extensive market for their surplus produce, and must consequently
havebeenencouragedtoincreaseitsquantity.
1299 [7] But that those great events should likewise have contributed to en-
courage the industry of countries, such as Hungary and Poland, which
maynever,perhaps,havesentasinglecommodityoftheirownproduceto
America, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident. That those events have
doneso,however,cannotbedoubted. SomepartoftheproduceofAmerica
is consumed in Hungary and Poland, and there is some demand there for
the sugar, chocolate, and tobacco of that new quarter of the world. But G.ed.p592
those commodities must be purchased with something which is either the
produce of the industry of Hungary and Poland, or with something which
had been purchased with some part of that produce. Those commodities
ofAmericaarenewvalues,newequivalents,introducedintoHungaryand
Poland to be exchanged there for the surplus produce of those countries.
By being carried thither they create a new and more extensive market
for that surplus produce. They raise its value, and thereby contribute to
encourageitsincrease. ThoughnopartofitmayeverbecarriedtoAmer-
ica, it may be carried to other countries which purchase it with a part of
theirshareofthesurplusproduceofAmerica;anditmayfindamarketby
meansofthecirculationofthattradewhichwasoriginallyputintomotion
bythesurplusproduceofAmerica.
1300 [8] Those great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoy-
ments, and to augment the industry of countries which not only never
sent any commodities to America, but never received any from it. Even
such countries may have received a greater abundance of other commod-
ities from countries of which the surplus produce had been augmented by
meansoftheAmericantrade. Thisgreaterabundance,asitmustnecessar-
ily have increased their enjoyments, so it must likewise have augmented
theirindustry. Agreaternumberofnewequivalentsofsomekindorother
must have been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus pro-
duce of that industry. A more extensive market must have been created
forthatsurplusproducesoastoraiseitsvalue,andtherebyencourageits
increase. Themassofcommoditiesannuallythrownintothegreatcircleof
European commerce, and by its various revolutions annually distributed
among all the different nations comprehended within it, must have been
augmented by the whole surplus produce of America. A greater share of
thisgreatermass,therefore,islikelytohavefallentoeachofthosenations,
tohaveincreasedtheirenjoyments,andaugmentedtheirindustry.
1301 [9] The exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish, or, at
least, to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the en-
joymentsandindustryofallthosenationsingeneral,andoftheAmerican
colonies in particular. It is a dead weight upon the action of one of the
great springs which puts into motion a great part of the business of man-
458 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
kind. By rendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries, it
lessens its consumption, and thereby cramps the industry of the colonies,
and both the enjoyments and the industry of all other countries, which
both enjoy less when they pay more for what they enjoy, and produce less
whentheygetlessforwhattheyproduce. Byrenderingtheproduceofall
other countries dearer in the colonies, it cramps, in the same manner the
industry of all other countries, and both the enjoyments and the industry
of the colonies. It is a clog which, for the supposed benefit of some par-
ticular countries, embarrasses the pleasures and encumbers the industry
of all other countries; but of the colonies more than of any other. It not G.ed.p593
onlyexcludes,asmuchaspossible,allothercountriesfromoneparticular
market; but it confines, as much as Possible, the colonies to one particu-
lar market; and the difference is very great between being excluded from
oneparticularmarket,whenallothersareopen,andbeingconfinedtoone
particularmarket,whenallothersareshutup. Thesurplusproduceofthe
colonies, however, is the original source of all that increase of enjoyments
andindustrywhichEuropederivesfromthediscoveryandcolonizationof
America; and the exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to render
thissourcemuchlessabundantthanitotherwisewouldbe.
1302 [10] The particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from
thecolonieswhichparticularlybelongtoitareoftwodifferentkinds;first,
thosecommonadvantageswhicheveryempirederivesfromtheprovinces
subject to its dominion; and, secondly, those peculiar advantages which
are supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the
EuropeancoloniesofAmerica.
1303 [11] The common advantages which every empire derives from the
provincessubjecttoitsdominionconsist, first, inthemilitaryforcewhich
they furnish for its defence; and, secondly, in the revenue which they fur-
nishforthesupportofitscivilgovernment. TheRomancolonesfurnished
occasionally both the one and the other. The Greek colonies, sometimes,
furnishedamilitaryforce,butseldomanyrevenue. Theyseldomacknow-
ledged themselves subject to the dominion of the mother city. They were
generallyheralliesinwar,butveryseldomhersubjectsinpeace.
1304 [12] The European colonies of America have never yet furnished any milit-
ary force for the defence of the mother country. Their military force has
neveryetbeensufficientfortheirowndefence;andinthedifferentwarsin
whichthemothercountrieshavebeenengaged,thedefenceoftheircolon-
ies has generally occasioned a very considerable distraction of the milit-
ary force of those countries. In this respect, therefore, all the European
colonieshave,withoutexception,beenacauseratherofweaknessthanof
strengthtotheirrespectivemothercountries.
1305 [13] The colonies of Spain and Portugal only have contributed any revenue
towardsthedefenceofthemothercountry, orthesupportofhercivilgov-
ernment. ThetaxeswhichhavebeenlevieduponthoseofotherEuropean
nations, upon those of England in particular, have seldom been equal to G.ed.p594
459 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the expense laid out upon them in time of peace, and never sufficient to
defray that which they occasioned in time of war. Such colonies, there-
fore, have been a source of expense and not of revenue to their respective
mothercountries.
1306 [14] The advantages of such colonies to their respective mother countries
consistaltogetherinthosepeculiaradvantageswhicharesupposedtores-
ultfromprovincesofsoverypeculiaranatureastheEuropeancoloniesof
America; and the exclusive trade, it is acknowledged, is the sole source of
allthosepeculiaradvantages.
1307 [15] Inconsequenceofthisexclusivetrade, allthatpartofthesurpluspro-
duceoftheEnglishcolonies,forexample,whichconsistsinwhatarecalled
enumerated commodities, can be sent to no other country but England.
Other countries must afterwards buy it of her. It must be cheaper there-
fore in England than it can be in any other country, and must contrib-
ute more to increase the enjoyments of England than those of any other
country. It must likewise contribute more to encourage her industry. For
all those parts of her own surplus produce which England exchanges for
thoseenumeratedcommodities,shemustgetabetterpricethananyother
countriescangetforthelikepartsoftheirs,whentheyexchangethemfor
the same commodities. The manufacturers of England, for example, will
purchase a greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her own colonies
than the like manufactures of other countries can purchase of that sugar
and tobacco. So far, therefore, as the manufactures of England and those
of other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and tobacco of
the English colonies, this superiority of price gives an encouragement to
the former beyond what the latter can in these circumstances enjoy. The
exclusivetradeofthecolonies,therefore,asitdiminishes,oratleastkeeps
down below what they would otherwise rise to, both the enjoyments and
theindustryofthecountrieswhichdonotpossessit;soitgivesanevident
advantagetothecountrieswhichdopossessitoverthoseothercountries.
1308 [16] Thisadvantage,however,willperhapsbefoundtoberatherwhatmay
becalledarelativethananabsoluteadvantage;andtogiveasuperiorityto
thecountrywhichenjoysitratherbydepressingtheindustryandproduce G.ed.p595
of other countries than by raising those of that particular country above
whattheywouldnaturallyrisetointhecaseofafreetrade.
1309 [17] The tobacco of Maryland and Virginia, for example, by means of the
monopolywhichEnglandenjoysofit,certainlycomescheapertoEngland
than it can do to France, to whom England commonly sells a consider-
able part of it. But had France, and all other European countries been,
at all times, allowed a free trade to Maryland and Virginia, the tobacco
of those colonies might, by this time, have come cheaper than it actually
does, not only to all those other countries, but likewise to England. The
produce of tobacco, in consequence of a market so much more extensive
than any which it has hitherto enjoyed, might, and probably would, by
thistime,havebeensomuchincreasedastoreducetheprofitsofatobacco
460 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
plantation to their natural level with those of a corn plantation, which, it
is supposed, they are still somewhat above. The price of tobacco might,
andprobablywould,bythistime,havefallensomewhatlowerthanitisat
present. AnequalquantityofthecommoditieseitherofEnglandorofthose
othercountriesmighthavepurchasedinMarylandandVirginiaagreater
quantityoftobaccothanitcandoatpresent,andconsequentlyhavebeen
sold there for so much a better price. So far as that weed, therefore, can,
byitscheapnessandabundance, increasetheenjoymentsoraugmentthe
industry either of England or of any other country, it would, probably, in
the case of a free trade, have produced both these effects in somewhat a
greater degree than it can do at present. England, indeed, would not in
this case have had any advantage over other countries. She might have
bought the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper, and consequently
have sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer than she actu-
allydoes. Butshecouldneitherhaveboughttheonecheapernorsoldthe
other dearer than any other country might have done. She might, per-
hapshavegainedanabsolute,butshewouldcertainlyhavelostarelative
advantage.
1310 [18] Inorder,however,toobtainthisrelativeadvantageinthecolonytrade,
in order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding as
much as possible other nations from any share in it, England, there are
very probable reasons for believing, has not only sacrificed a part of the
absolute advantage which she, as well as every other nation, might have
derivedfromthattrade,buthassubjectedherselfbothtoanabsoluteand
toarelativedisadvantageinalmosteveryotherbranchoftrade.
1311 [19] When,bytheActofNavigation,Englandassumedtoherselfthemono-
poly of the colony trade, the foreign capitals which had before been em-
ployed in it were necessarily withdrawn from it. The English capital,
whichhadbeforecarriedonbutapartofit,wasnowtocarryonthewhole.
The capital which had before supplied the colonies with but a part of the
goods which they wanted from Europe was now all that was employed to G.ed.p596
supplythemwiththewhole. Butitcouldnotsupplythemwiththewhole,
and the goods with which it did supply them were necessarily sold very
dear. The capital which had before bought but a part of the surplus pro-
duceofthecolonies,wasnowallthatwasemployedtobuythewhole. But
it could not buy the whole at anything near the old price, and, therefore,
whatever it did buy it necessarily bought very cheap. But in an employ-
ment of capital in which the merchant sold very dear and bought very
cheap,theprofitmusthavebeenverygreat,andmuchabovetheordinary
level of profit in other branches of trade. This superiority of profit in the
colony trade could not fail to draw from other branches of trade a part of
the capital which had before been employed in them. But this revulsion
of capital, as it must have gradually increased the competition of capitals
inthecolonytrade,soitmusthavegraduallydiminishedthatcompetition

theprofitsofallcametoanewlevel, differentfromandsomewhathigher
thanthatatwhichtheyhadbeenbefore.
1312 [20] Thisdoubleeffectofdrawingcapitalfromallothertrades, andofrais-
ing the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwise would have been

lishment,buthascontinuedtobeproducedbyiteversince.
1313 [21] First,thismonopolyhasbeencontinuallydrawingcapitalfromallother

1314 [22] ThoughthewealthofGreatBritainhasincreasedverymuchsincethe
establishment of the Act of Navigation, it certainly has not increased in
thesameproportionasthatofthecolonies. Buttheforeigntradeofevery
countrynaturallyincreasesinproportiontoitswealth,itssurplusproduce
inproportiontoitswholeproduce; andGreatBritainhavingengrossedto
herself almost the whole of what may be called the foreign trade of the
colonies, and her capital not having increased in the same proportion as
theextentofthattrade,shecouldnotcarryitonwithoutcontinuallywith-
drawing from other branches of trade some part of the capital which had
before been employed in them as well as withholding from them a great
deal more which would otherwise have gone to them. Since the estab-
lishment of the Act of Navigation, accordingly, the colony trade has been
continually increasing, while many other branches of foreign trade, par-
ticularly of that to other parts of Europe, have been continually decaying.
Our manufactures for foreign sale, instead of being suited, as before the
Act of Navigation, to the neighbouring market of Europe, or to the more
distantoneofthecountrieswhichlieroundtheMediterraneanSea,have,
thegreaterpartofthem,beenaccommodatedtothestillmoredistantone G.ed.p597
ofthecolonies,tothemarketinwhichtheyhavethemonopolyratherthan

branchesofforeigntrade,which,bySirMatthewDeckerandotherwriters,
have been sought for in the excess and improper mode of taxation, in the
highpriceoflabour,intheincreaseofluxury,etc.,mayallbefoundinthe
overgrowth of the colony trade. The mercantile capital of Great Britain,
though very great, yet not being infinite, and though greatly increased
sincetheActofNavigation,yetnotbeingincreasedinthesameproportion
as the colony trade, that trade could not possibly be carried on without
withdrawing some part of that capital from other branches of trade, nor
consequentlywithoutsomedecayofthoseotherbranches.
1315 [23] England, it must be observed, was a great trading country, her mer-
cantilecapitalwasverygreatandlikelytobecomestillgreaterandgreater
everyday,notonlybeforetheActofNavigationhadestablishedthemono-
poly of the colony trade, but before that trade was very considerable. In
the Dutch war, during the government of Cromwell, her navy was super-
iortothatofHolland; andinthatwhichbrokeoutinthebeginningofthe
reign of Charles II, it was at last equal, perhaps superior, to the united
462 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
navies of France and Holland. Its superiority, perhaps, would scarce ap-
pear greater in the present times; at least if the Dutch navy was to bear
the same proportion to the Dutch commerce now which it did then. But
this great naval power could not, in either of those wars, be owing to the
Act of Navigation. During the first of them the plan of that act had been
but just formed; and though before the breaking out of the second it had
beenfullyenactedbylegalauthority,yetnopartofitcouldhavehadtime
to produce any considerable effect, and least of all that part which estab-
lishedtheexclusivetradetothecolonies. Boththecoloniesandtheirtrade
were inconsiderable then in comparison of what they are now. The island
of Jamaica was an unwholesome desert, little inhabited, and less cultiv-
ated. New York and New Jersey were in the possession of the Dutch: the
half of St. Christopher’s in that of the French. The island of Antigua, the
two Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nova Scotia were not planted.
Virginia,Maryland,andNewEnglandwereplanted;andthoughtheywere
very thriving colonies, yet there was not, perhaps, at that time, either in
Europe or America, a single person who foresaw or even suspected the G.ed.p598
rapidprogresswhichtheyhavesincemadeinwealth,population,andim-
provement. TheislandofBarbadoes,inshort,wastheonlyBritishcolony
of any consequence of which the condition at that time bore any resemb-
lancetowhatitisatpresent. Thetradeofthecolonies,ofwhichEngland,
evenforsometimeaftertheActofNavigation,enjoyedbutapart(forthe
Act of Navigation was not very strictly executed till several years after it
wasenacted),couldnotatthattimebethecauseofthegreattradeofEng-
land,norofthegreatnavalpowerwhichwassupportedbythattrade. The
tradewhichatthattimesupportedthatgreatnavalpowerwasthetradeof
Europe, andofthecountrieswhichlieroundtheMediterraneanSea. But
the share which Great Britain at present enjoys of that trade could not
supportanysuchgreatnavalpower. Hadthegrowingtradeofthecolonies
beenleftfreetoallnations,whatevershareofitmighthavefallentoGreat
Britain, and a very considerable share would probably have fallen to her,
musthavebeenallanadditiontothisgreattradeofwhichshewasbefore
in possession. In consequence of the monopoly, the increase of the colony
trade has not so much occasioned an addition to the trade which Great
Britainhadbeforeasatotalchangeinitsdirection.
1316 [24] Secondly,thismonopolyhasnecessarilycontributedtokeepuptherate
of profit in all the different branches of British trade higher than it nat-
urally would have been had all nations been allowed a free trade to the
Britishcolonies.
1317 [25] The monopoly of the colony trade, as it necessarily drew towards that
tradeagreaterproportionofthecapitalofGreatBritainthanwhatwould
havegonetoitofitsownaccord;sobytheexpulsionofallforeigncapitals
itnecessarilyreducedthewholequantityofcapitalemployedinthattrade
belowwhatitnaturallywouldhavebeeninthecaseofafreetrade. But,by
lesseningthecompetitionofcapitalsinthatbranchoftrade,itnecessarily
463 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
raised the rate of profit in that branch. By lessening, too, the competition
of British capitals in all other branches of trade, it necessarily raised the
rateofBritishprofitinallthoseotherbranches. Whatevermayhavebeen,
atanyparticularperiod,sincetheestablishmentoftheActofNavigation,
thestateorextentofthemercantilecapitalofGreatBritain,themonopoly
ofthecolonytrademust,duringthecontinuanceofthatstate,haveraised
the ordinary rate of British profit higher than it otherwise would have
been both in that and in all the other branches of British trade. If, since
the establishment of the Act of Navigation, the ordinary rate of British G.ed.p599
profit has fallen considerably, as it certainly has, it must have fallen still
lower,hadnotthemonopolyestablishedbythatactcontributedtokeepit
up.
1318 [26] But whatever raises in any country the ordinary rate of profit higher
than it otherwise would be, necessarily subjects that country both to an
absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which
shehasnotthemonopoly.
1319 [27] Itsubjectshertoanabsolutedisadvantage;becauseinsuchbranchesof
trade her merchants cannot get this greater profit without selling dearer
than they otherwise would do both the goods of foreign countries which
theyimportintotheirown,andthegoodsoftheirowncountrywhichthey
export to foreign countries. Their own country must both buy dearer and
sell dearer; must both buy less and sell less; must both enjoy less and
produceless,thansheotherwisewoulddo.
1320 [28] It subjects her to a relative disadvantage; because in such branches of
trade it sets other countries which are not subject to the same absolute
disadvantageeithermoreaboveherorlessbelowherthantheyotherwise
would be. It enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more in
proportion to what she enjoys and produces. It renders their superiority
greaterortheirinferioritylessthanitotherwisewouldbe. Byraisingthe
priceofherproduceabovewhatitotherwisewouldbe,itenablesthemer-
chantsofothercountriestoundersellherinforeignmarkets,andthereby

1321 [29] OurmerchantsfrequentlycomplainofthehighwagesofBritishlabour
as the cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets,
but they are silent about the high profits of stock. They complain of the
extravagant gain of other people, but they say nothing of their own. The
high profits of British stock, however, may contribute towards raising the
priceofBritishmanufacturesinmanycasesasmuch,andinsomeperhaps
more,thanthehighwagesofBritishlabour.
1322 [30] It is in this manner that the capital of Great Britain, one may justly
say, has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part
ofthedifferentbranchesoftradeofwhichshehasnotthemonopoly;from
thetradeofEuropeinparticular, andfromthatofthecountrieswhichlie
roundtheMediterraneanSea.
464 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1323 [31] Ithaspartlybeendrawnfromthosebranchesoftradebytheattraction
of superior profit in the colony trade in consequence of the continual in- G.ed.p600
creaseofthattrade,andofthecontinualinsufficiencyofthecapitalwhich
hadcarrieditononeyeartocarryitonthenext.
1324 [32] It has partly been driven from them by the advantage which the high
rate of profit, established in Great Britain, gives to other countries in all
the different branches of trade of which Great Britain has not the mono-
poly.
1325 [33] As the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other
branches a part of the British capital which would otherwise have been
employed in them, so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which
wouldneverhavegonetothemhadtheynotbeenexpelledfromthecolony
trade. Inthoseotherbranchesoftradeithasdiminishedthecompetitionof
Britishcapital,andtherebyraisedtherateofBritishprofithigherthanit
otherwisewouldhavebeen. Onthecontrary, ithasincreasedthecompet-
ition of foreign capitals, and thereby sunk the rate of foreign profit lower
than it otherwise would have been. Both in the one way and in the other
it must evidently have subjected Great Britain to a relative disadvantage
inallthoseotherbranchesoftrade.
1326 [34] Thecolonytrade, however, itmayperhapsbesaid, ismoreadvantage-
ous to Great Britain than any other; and the monopoly, by forcing into
that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what
would otherwise have gone to it, has turned that capital into an employ-
mentmoreadvantageoustothecountrythananyotherwhichitcouldhave
found.
1327 [35] The most advantageous employment of any capital to the country to
whichitbelongsisthatwhichmaintainstherethegreatestquantityofpro-

1330 [38] Ithas,inallcases,forcedsomepartofthatcapitalfromthetradewith
Europe,andwiththecountrieswhichlieroundtheMediterraneanSea,to
that with the more distant regions of America and the West Indies, from
which the returns are necessarily less frequent, not only on account of
thegreaterdistance,butonaccountofthepeculiarcircumstancesofthose
countries. New colonies, it has already been observed, are always under-
stocked. Their capital is always much less than what they could employ
with great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultivation of
theirland. Theyhaveaconstantdemand,therefore,formorecapitalthan
theyhaveoftheirown;and,inordertosupplythedeficiencyoftheirown,
they endeavour to borrow as much as they can of the mother country, to
whomtheyare,therefore,alwaysindebt. Themostcommonwayinwhich
the colonists contract this debt is not by borrowing upon bond of the rich
people of the mother country, though they sometimes do this too, but by
runningasmuchinarreartotheircorrespondents,whosupplythemwith
goodsfromEurope,asthosecorrespondentswillallowthem. Theirannual
returnsfrequentlydonotamounttomorethanathird,andsometimesnot
to so great a proportion of what they owe. The whole capital, therefore,
whichtheircorrespondentsadvancetothemisseldomreturnedtoBritain G.ed.p602
in less than three, and sometimes not in less than four or five years. But
a British capital of a thousand pounds, for example, which is returned to
Great Britain only once in five years, can keep in constant employment
only one-fifth part of the British industry which it could maintain if the
whole was returned once in the year; and, instead of the quantity of in-
dustry which a thousand pounds could maintain for a year, can keep in
constant employment the quantity only which two hundred pounds can
maintainforayear. Theplanter,nodoubt,bythehighpricewhichhepays

losswhichhiscorrespondentcansustainbythisdelay. Butthoughhemay
make up the loss of his correspondent, he cannot make up that of Great
Britain. In a trade of which the returns are very distant, the profit of the
merchant may be as great or greater than in one in which they are very
frequent and near; but the advantage of the country in which he resides,
thequantityofproductivelabourconstantlymaintainedthere,theannual
produceofthelandandlabourmustalwaysbemuchless. Thatthereturns

in general, not only more distant but more irregular, and more uncertain

too,thanthoseofthetradetoanypartofEurope,orevenofthecountries
whichlieroundtheMediterraneanSea,willreadilybeallowed,Iimagine,
byeverybodywhohasanyexperienceofthosedifferentbranchesoftrade.
1331 [39] Secondly, the monopoly of the colony trade has, in many cases, forced
some part of the capital of Great Britain from a direct foreign trade of
consumptionintoaround-aboutone.
1332 [40] Amongtheenumeratedcommoditieswhichcanbesenttonoothermar-
ketbutGreatBritain,thereareseveralofwhichthequantityexceedsvery
much the consumption of Great Britain, and of which a part, therefore,
must be exported to other countries. But this cannot be done without for-
cing some part of the capital of Great Britain into a round-about foreign
tradeofconsumption. MarylandandVirginia,forexample,sendannually
toGreatBritainupwardsofninety-sixthousandhogsheadsoftobacco,and
theconsumptionofGreatBritainissaidnottoexceedfourteenthousand.
Upwards of eighty-two thousand hogsheads, therefore, must be exported
to other countries, to France, to Holland, and to the countries which lie
round the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. But that part of the capital of G.ed.p603
GreatBritainwhichbringsthoseeighty-twothousandhogsheadstoGreat
Britain, which re-exports them from thence to those other countries, and
whichbringsbackfromthoseothercountriestoGreatBritaineithergoods
ormoneyinreturn,isemployedinaround-aboutforeigntradeofconsump-
tion; and is necessarily forced into this employment in order to dispose of
this great surplus. If we would compute in how many years the whole
of this capital is likely to come back to Great Britain, we must add to the
distanceoftheAmericanreturnsthatofthereturnsfromthoseothercoun-
tries. If,inthedirectforeigntradeofconsumptionwhichwecarryonwith
America,thewholecapitalemployedfrequentlydoesnotcomebackinless
than three or four years, the whole capital employed in this round-about
oneisnotlikelytocomebackinlessthanfourorfive. Iftheonecankeep
in constant employment but a third or a fourth part of the domestic in-
dustry which could be maintained by a capital returned once in the year,
the other can keep in constant employment but a fourth or fifth part of
thatindustry. Atsomeoftheout-portsacreditiscommonlygiventothose
foreign correspondents to whom they export their tobacco. At the port of
London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh
and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole
round-abouttradearemoredistantthanthereturnsfromAmericabythe
time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, how-
ever, they may sometimes lie long enough. But had not the colonies been
confined to the market of Great Britain for the sale of their tobacco, very
little more of it would probably have come to us than what was necessary
for the home consumption. The goods which Great Britain purchases at
present for her own consumption with the great surplus of tobacco which
she exports to other countries, she would in this case probably have pur-
chasedwiththeimmediateproduceofherownindustry,orwithsomepart
467 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of her own manufactures. That produce, those manufactures, instead of
being almost entirely suited to one great market, as at present, would
probablyhavebeenfittedtoagreatnumberofsmallermarkets. Insteadof
one great round-about foreign trade of consumption, Great Britain would
probably have carried on a great number of small direct foreign trades of
the same kind. On account of the frequency of the returns, a part, and
probablybutasmallpart;perhapsnotaboveathirdorafourthofthecap-
ital which at present carries on this great round-about trade might have
been sufficient to carry on all those small direct ones, might have kept
in constant employment an equal quantity of British industry, and have
equallysupportedtheannualproduceofthelandandlabourofGreatBri-
tain. All the purposes of this trade being, in this manner, answered by a
muchsmallercapital,therewouldhavebeenalargesparecapitaltoapply G.ed.p604

toextendthecommerceofGreatBritain;tocomeintocompetitionatleast
withtheotherBritishcapitalsemployedinallthosedifferentways,tore-
ducetherateofprofitinthemall,andtherebytogivetoGreatBritain,in
all of them, a superiority over other countries still greater than what she
atpresentenjoys.
1333 [41] The monopoly of the colony trade, too, has forced some part of the
capital of Great Britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a car-
rying trade; and consequently, from supporting more or less the industry
ofGreatBritain,tobeemployedaltogetherinsupportingpartlythatofthe
coloniesandpartlythatofsomeothercountries.
1334 [42] The goods, for example, which are annually purchased with the great
surplusofeighty-twothousandhogsheadsoftobaccoannuallyre-exported
from Great Britain are not all consumed in Great Britain. Part of them,
linenfromGermanyandHolland, forexample, isreturnedtothecolonies
for their particular consumption. But that part of the capital of Great
Britainwhichbuysthetobaccowithwhichthislinenisafterwardsbought
is necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of Great Britain,
to be employed altogether in supporting, partly that of the colonies, and
partly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the
produceoftheirownindustry.
1335 [43] Themonopolyofthecolonytradebesides,byforcingtowardsitamuch
greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would natur-
allyhavegonetoit,seemstohavebrokenaltogetherthatnaturalbalance
whichwouldotherwisehavetakenplaceamongallthedifferentbranches
ofBritishindustry. TheindustryofGreatBritain,insteadofbeingaccom-
modated to a great number of small markets, has been principally suited
toonegreatmarket. Hercommerce,insteadofrunninginagreatnumber
of small channels, has been taught to run principally in one great chan-
nel. Butthewholesystemofherindustryandcommercehastherebybeen
renderedlesssecure,thewholestateofherbodypoliticlesshealthfulthan
it otherwise would have been. In her present condition, Great Britain re-
468 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
semblesoneofthoseunwholesomebodiesinwhichsomeofthevitalparts
are overgrown, and which, upon that account, are liable to many dan-
gerous disorders scarce incident to those in which all the parts are more
properly proportioned. A small stop in that great blood-vessel, which has
beenartificiallyswelledbeyonditsnaturaldimensions,andthroughwhich
anunnaturalproportionoftheindustryandcommerceofthecountryhas
been forced to circulate, is very likely to bring on the most dangerous dis- G.ed.p605
orders upon the whole body politic. The expectation of a rupture with the
colonies,accordingly,hasstruckthepeopleofGreatBritainwithmoreter-
ror than they ever felt for a Spanish armada, or a French invasion. It
was this terror, whether well or ill grounded, which rendered the repeal
of the Stamp Act, among the merchants at least, a popular measure. In
the total exclusion from the colony market, was it to last only for a few
years, the greater part of our merchants used to fancy that they foresaw
an entire stop to their trade; the greater part of our master manufactur-
ers,theentireruinoftheirbusiness;andthegreaterpartofourworkmen,
an end of their employment. A rupture with any of our neighbours upon
the continent, though likely, too, to occasion some stop or interruption in
the employments of some of all these different orders of people, is fore-
seen, however, without any such general emotion. The blood, of which
the circulation is stopped in some of the smaller vessels, easily disgorges
itself into the greater without occasioning any dangerous disorder; but,
when it is stopped in any of the greater vessels, convulsions, apoplexy,
or death, are the immediate and unavoidable consequences. If but one

1337 [45] Five different events, unforeseen and unthought of, have very fortu-
natelyconcurredtohinderGreatBritainfromfeeling,sosensiblyasitwas
generally expected she would, the total exclusion which has now taken
place for more than a year (from the first of December, 1774) from a
very important branch of the colony trade, that of the twelve associated
provincesofNorthAmerica. First,thosecolonies,inpreparingthemselves
for their non-importation agreement, drained Great Britain completely
of all the commodities which were fit for their market; secondly, the ex-
traordinarydemandoftheSpanishFlotahas,thisyear,drainedGermany G.ed.p607
and the North of many commodities, linen in particular, which used to
comeintocompetition,evenintheBritishmarket,withthemanufactures
of Great Britain; thirdly, the peace between Russia and Turkey has occa-
sioned an extraordinary demand from the Turkey market, which, during
the distress of the country, and while a Russian fleet was cruising in the
Archipelago, had been very poorly supplied; fourthly, the demand of the
North of Europe for the manufactures of Great Britain has been increas-
ingfromyeartoyearforsometimepast;andfifthly,thelatepartitionand
consequential pacification of Poland, by opening the market of that great
country,havethisyearaddedanextraordinarydemandfromthencetothe
increasingdemandoftheNorth. Theseeventsareall,exceptthefourth,in
their nature transitory and accidental, and the exclusion from so import-
antabranchofthecolonytrade,ifunfortunatelyitshouldcontinuemuch
longer, may still occasion some degree of distress. This distress, however,
as it will come on gradually, will be felt much less severely than if it had
comeonallatonce; and, inthemeantime, theindustryandcapitalofthe
country may find a new employment and direction, so as to prevent this
distressfromeverrisingtoanyconsiderableheight.
1338 [46] The monopoly of the colony trade, therefore, so far as it has turned to-
wards that trade a greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than
what would otherwise have gone to it, has in all cases turned it, from a
foreign trade of consumption with a neighbouring into one with a more
distant country; in many cases, from a direct foreign trade of consump-
tion into a round-about one; and in some cases, from all foreign trade of
consumptionintoacarryingtrade. Ithasinallcases, therefore, turnedit
470 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
from a direction in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of
productivelabourintooneinwhichitcanmaintainamuchsmallerquant-
ity. Bysuiting,besides,tooneparticularmarketonlysogreatapartofthe
industryandcommerceofGreatBritain,ithasrenderedthewholestateof
thatindustryandcommercemoreprecariousandlesssecurethaniftheir
producehadbeenaccommodatedtoagreatervarietyofmarkets.
1339 [47] We must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade
and those of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and ne-
cessarily beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But the
former are so beneficial that the colony trade, though subject to a mono-
poly,andnotwithstandingthehurtfuleffectsofthatmonopoly,isstillupon
thewholebeneficial,andgreatlybeneficial;thoughagooddeallesssothan G.ed.p608
itotherwisewouldbe.
1340 [48] The effect of the colony trade in its natural and free state is to open a
great, though distant, market for such parts of the produce of British in-
dustryasmayexceedthedemandofthemarketsnearerhome,ofthoseof
Europe, and of the countries which lie round the Mediterranean Sea. In
its natural and free state, the colony trade, without drawing from those
markets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them, en-
courages Great Britain to increase the surplus continually by continually
presentingnewequivalentstobeexchangedforit. Initsnaturalandfree
state, thecolonytradetendstoincreasethequantityofproductivelabour
in Great Britain, but without altering in any respect the direction of that
whichhadbeenemployedtherebefore. Inthenaturalandfreestateofthe
colonytrade, thecompetition ofall other nationswould hinderthe rateof
profit from rising above the common level either in the new market or in
the new employment. The new market, without drawing anything from
the old one, would create, if one may say so, a new produce for its own
supply; and that new produce would constitute a new capital for carrying
on the new employment, which in the same manner would draw nothing
fromtheoldone.
1341 [49] The monopoly of the colony trade, on the contrary, by excluding the
competition of other nations, and thereby raising the rate of profit both
in the new market and in the new employment, draws produce from the
old market and capital from the old employment. To augment our share
of the colony trade beyond what it otherwise would be is the avowed pur-
poseofthemonopoly. Ifourshareofthattradeweretobenogreaterwith
than it would have been without the monopoly, there could have been no
reason for establishing the monopoly. But whatever forces into a branch
of trade of which the returns are slower and more distant than those of
the greater part of other trades, a greater proportion of the capital of any
country than what of its own accord would go to that branch, necessar-
ily renders the whole quantity of productive labour annually maintained
there,thewholeannualproduceofthelandandlabourofthatcountry,less
than they otherwise would be. It keeps down the revenue of the inhabit-
471 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ants of that country below what it would naturally rise to, and thereby
diminishes their power of accumulation. It not only hinders, at all times,
their capital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labour
as it would otherwise maintain, but it hinders it from increasing so fast
as it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a still
greaterquantityofproductivelabour.
1342 [50] The natural good effects of the colony trade, however, more than
counterbalance to Great Britain the bad effects of the monopoly, so that, G.ed.p609
monopoly and all together, that trade, even as it carried on at present, is
not only advantageous, but greatly advantageous. The new market and
the new employment which are opened by the colony trade are of much
greater extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employ-
mentwhichislostbythemonopoly. Thenewproduceandthenewcapital
which has been created, if one may say so, by the colony trade, maintain
in Great Britain a greater quantity of productive labour than what can
havebeenthrownoutofemploymentbytherevulsionofcapitalfromother
trades of which the returns are more frequent. If the colony trade, how-
ever, evenasitiscarriedonatpresent, isadvantageoustoGreatBritain,
itisnotbymeansofthemonopoly,butinspiteofthemonopoly.
1343 [51] It is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of Europe
thatthecolonytradeopensanewmarket. Agricultureistheproperbusi-
ness of all new colonies; a business which the cheapness of land renders
more advantageous than any other. They abound, therefore, in the rude
produceofland,andinsteadofimportingitfromothercountries,theyhave
generally a large surplus to export. In new colonies, agriculture either
drawshandsfromallotheremployments,orkeepsthemfromgoingtoany
other employment. There are few hands to spare for the necessary, and
none for the ornamental manufactures. The greater part of the manufac-
turesofbothkindstheyfinditcheapertopurchaseofothercountriesthan
to make for themselves. It is chiefly by encouraging the manufactures of
Europe that the colony trade indirectly encourages its agriculture. The
manufacturesofEurope,towhomthattradegivesemployment,constitute
a new market for the produce of the land; and the most advantageous of
all markets, the home market for the corn and cattle, for the bread and
butcher’s meat of Europe, is thus greatly extended by means of the trade
toAmerica.
1344 [52] But that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies
is not alone sufficient to establish, or even to maintain manufactures in
anycountry,theexamplesofSpainandPortugalsufficientlydemonstrate.
SpainandPortugalweremanufacturingcountriesbeforetheyhadanycon-
siderablecolonies. Sincetheyhadtherichestandmostfertileintheworld,
theyhavebothceasedtobeso.
1345 [53] In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by
other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects
of the colony trade. These causes seem to be other monopolies of differ-
472 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ent kinds; the degradation of the value of gold and silver below what it is
in most other countries; the exclusion from foreign markets by improper G.ed.p610
taxes upon exportation, and the narrowing of the home market, by still
moreimpropertaxesuponthetransportationofgoodsfromonepartofthe
country to another; but above all, that irregular and partial administra-
tion of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the
pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of
the nation afraid to prepare goods for the consumption of those haughty
andgreatmentowhomtheydarenotrefusetoselluponcredit, andfrom
theyarealtogetheruncertainofrepayment.
1346 [54] InEngland,onthecontrary,thenaturalgoodeffectsofthecolonytrade,
assistedbyothercauses,haveinagreatmeasureconqueredthebadeffects
of the monopoly. These causes seem to be: the general liberty of trade,
which, notwithstanding some restraints, is at least equal, perhaps super-
ior, to what it is in any other country; the liberty of exporting, duty free,
almostallsortsofgoodswhicharetheproduceofdomesticindustrytoal-
mostanyforeigncountry;andwhatperhapsisofstillgreaterimportance,
the unbounded liberty of transporting them from any one part of our own
countrytoanyotherwithoutbeingobligedtogiveanyaccounttoanypub-
lic office, without being liable to question or examination of any kind; but
aboveall,thatequalandimpartialadministrationofjusticewhichrenders
the rights of the meanest British subject respectable to the greatest, and
which, by securing to every man the fruits of his own industry, gives the
greatestandmosteffectualencouragementtoeverysortofindustry.
1347 [55] If the manufactures of Great Britain, however, have been advanced,
as they certainly have, by the colony trade, it has not been by means of
the monopoly of that trade but in spite of the monopoly. The effect of the
monopoly has been, not to augment the quantity, but to alter the quality
and shape of a part of the manufactures of Great Britain, and to accom-
modate to a market, from which the returns are slow and distant, what
would otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the returns
are frequent and near. Its effect has consequently been to turn a part of
the capital of Great Britain from an employment in which it would have
maintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry to one in which
it maintains a much smaller, and thereby to diminish, instead of increas-
ing, the whole quantity of manufacturing industry maintained in Great
Britain.
1348 [56] Themonopolyofthecolonytrade,therefore,likealltheothermeanand
malignant expedients of the mercantile system, depresses the industry of
all other countries, but chiefly that of the colonies, without in the least G.ed.p611
increasing, but on the contrary diminishing that of the country in whose
favouritisestablished.
1349 [57] Themonopolyhindersthecapitalofthatcountry,whatevermayatany
particular time be the extent of that capital, from maintaining so great a
quantity of productive labour as it would otherwise maintain, and from
473 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
affording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as it would
otherwise afford. But as capital can be increased only by savings from
revenue, the monopoly, by hindering it from affording so great a revenue
asitwouldotherwiseafford,necessarilyhindersitfromincreasingsofast
as it would otherwise increase, and consequently from maintaining a still
greaterquantityofproductivelabour,andaffordingastillgreaterrevenue
to the industrious inhabitants of that country. One great original source
of revenue, therefore, the wages of labour, the monopoly must necessarily
have rendered at all times less abundant than it otherwise would have
been.
1350 [58] By raising the rate of mercantile profit, the monopoly discourages the
improvement of land. The profit of improvement depends upon the differ-
ence between what the land actually produces, and what, by the applica-
tionofacertaincapital,itcanbemadetoproduce. Ifthisdifferenceaffords
agreaterprofitthanwhatcanbedrawnfromanequalcapitalinanymer-
cantile employment, the improvement of land will draw capital from all
mercantileemployments. Iftheprofitisless,mercantileemploymentswill
draw capital from the improvement of land. Whatever, therefore, raises
therateofmercantileprofit,eitherlessensthesuperiorityorincreasesthe
inferiorityoftheprofitofimprovement;andintheonecasehinderscapital
fromgoingtoimprovement,andintheotherdrawscapitalfromit. Butby
discouraging improvement, the monopoly necessarily retards the natural
increase of another great original source of revenue, the rent of land. By
raising the rate of profit, too, the monopoly necessarily keeps up the mar-
ket rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be. But the price of
land in proportion to the rent which it affords, the number of years pur-
chasewhichiscommonlypaidforit,necessarilyfallsastherateofinterest
rises,andrisesastherateofinterestfalls. Themonopoly,therefore,hurts
the interest of the landlord two different ways, by retarding the natural
increase,first,ofhisrent,andsecondly,ofthepricewhichhewouldgetfor
hislandinproportiontotherentwhichitaffords.
1351 [59] The monopoly indeed raises the rate of mercantile profit, and thereby
augments somewhat the gain of our merchants. But as it obstructs the
naturalincreaseofcapital,ittendsrathertodiminishthantoincreasethe
sumtotaloftherevenuewhichtheinhabitantsofthecountryderivefrom G.ed.p612
theprofitsofstock;asmallprofituponagreatcapitalgenerallyaffordinga
greaterrevenuethanagreatprofituponasmallone. Themonopolyraises
the rate of profit, but it hinders the sum of profit from rising so high as it
otherwisewoulddo.
1352 [60] All the original sources of revenue, the wages of labour, the rent of
land, and the profits of stock, the monopoly renders much less abundant
than they otherwise would be. To promote the little interest of one little
orderofmeninonecountry,ithurtstheinterestofallotherordersofmen
inthatcountry,andofallmeninallothercountries.
1353 [61] It is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit that the monopoly
474 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
either has proved or could prove advantageous to any one particular or-
derofmen. Butbesidesallthebadeffectstothecountryingeneral,which
have already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a high rate of
profit, there is one more fatal, perhaps, than all these put together, but
which, if we may judge from experience, is inseparably connected with it.
Thehighrateofprofitseemseverywheretodestroythatparsimonywhich
inothercircumstancesisnaturaltothecharacterofthemerchant. When
profits are high that sober virtue seems to be superfluous and expensive
luxury to suit better the affluence of his situation. But the owners of the
greatmercantilecapitalsarenecessarilytheleadersandconductorsofthe
whole industry of every nation, and their example has a much greater in-
fluence upon the manners of the whole industrious part of it than that of
anyotherorderofmen. Ifhisemployerisattentiveandparsimonious,the
workman is very likely to be so too; but if the master is dissolute and dis-
orderly, the servant who shapes his work according to the pattern which
his master prescribes to him will shape his life too according to the ex-
amplewhichhesetshim. Accumulationisthuspreventedinthehandsof
allthosewhoarenaturallythemostdisposedtoaccumulate,andthefunds
destined for the maintenance of productive labour receive no augmenta-
tion from the revenue of those who ought naturally to augment them the
most. Thecapitalofthecountry,insteadofincreasing,graduallydwindles
away, and the quantity of productive labour maintained in it grows every
day less and less. Have the exorbitant profits of the merchants of Cadiz
and Lisbon augmented the capital of Spain and Portugal? Have they al-
leviated the poverty, have they promoted the industry of those two beg-
garly countries? Such has been the tone of mercantile expense in those G.ed.p613
two trading cities that those exorbitant profits, far from augmenting the
general capital of the country, seem scarce to have been sufficient to keep
up the capitals upon which they were made. Foreign capitals are every
dayintrudingthemselves,ifImaysayso,moreandmoreintothetradeof
Cadiz and Lisbon. It is to expel those foreign capitals from a trade which
theirowngrowseverydaymoreandmoreinsufficientforcarryingonthat
the Spaniards and Portuguese endeavour every day to straighten more
and more the galling bands of their absurd monopoly. Compare the mer-
cantile manners of Cadiz and Lisbon with those of Amsterdam, and you
will be sensible how differently the conduct and character of merchants
are affected by the high and by the low profits of stock. The merchants of
London, indeed, have not yet generally become such magnificent lords as
those of Cadiz and Lisbon, but neither are they in general such attentive
and parsimonious burghers as those of Amsterdam. They are supposed,
however, many of them, to be a good deal richer than the greater part of
the former, and not quite so rich as many of the latter. But the rate of
their profit is commonly much lower than that of the former, and a good
deal higher than thatof thelatter. Light come, light go, says theproverb;
andtheordinarytoneofexpenseseemseverywheretoberegulated,notso
475 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
much according to the real ability of spending, as to the supposed facility
ofgettingmoneytospend.
1354 [62] It is thus that the single advantage which the monopoly procures to a
single order of men is in many different ways hurtful to the general in-
terestofthecountry.
1355 [63] To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people
of customers may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of
shopkeepers. Itis,however,aprojectaltogetherunfitforanationofshop-

1356 [64] The maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the principal, or
more properly perhaps the sole end and purpose of the dominion which
Great Britain assumes over her colonies. In the exclusive trade, it is sup-

badge of their dependency, and it is the sole fruit which has hitherto
been gathered from that dependency. Whatever expense Great Britain
has hitherto laid out in maintaining this dependency has really been laid
out in order to support this monopoly. The expense of the ordinary peace
establishment of the colonies amounted, before the commencement of the
presentdisturbances,tothepayoftwentyregimentsoffoot;totheexpense
oftheartillery,stores,andextraordinaryprovisionswithwhichitwasne-
cessary to supply them; and to the expense of a very considerable naval
forcewhichwasconstantlykeptup,inordertoguard,fromthesmuggling

our West Indian islands. The whole expense of this peace establishment

in consequence of her considering her colonies as provinces subject to her
dominion, Great Britain has upon different occasions laid out upon their
defence. Wemustaddtoit,inparticular,thewholeexpenseofthelatewar,

1357 [65] Under the present system of management, therefore, Great Britain
derives nothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her
colonies.
1358 [66] To propose that Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority
over her colonies, and leave them to elect their own magistrates, to enact
477 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
their own laws, and to make peace and war as they might think proper,
would be to propose such a measure as never was, and never will be ad-
opted, byanynationintheworld. Nonationevervoluntarilygaveupthe
dominion of any province, how troublesome soever it might be to govern
it, and how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be in pro-
portion to the expense which it occasioned. Such sacrifices, though they G.ed.p617
mightfrequentlybeagreeabletotheinterest,arealwaysmortifyingtothe
pride of every nation, and what is perhaps of still greater consequence,
theyarealwayscontrarytotheprivateinterestofthegoverningpartofit,
whowouldtherebybedeprivedofthedisposalofmanyplacesoftrustand
profit, of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and distinction, which
the possession of the most turbulent, and, to the great body of the people,
the most unprofitable province seldom fails to afford. The most visionary
enthusiastwouldscarcebecapableofproposingsuchameasurewithany
serioushopesatleastofitseverbeingadopted. Ifitwasadopted,however,
GreatBritainwouldnotonlybeimmediatelyfreedfromthewholeannual
expense of the peace establishment of the colonies, but might settle with
them such a treaty of commerce as would effectually secure to her a free
trade, more advantageous to the great body of the people, though less so
tothemerchants,thanthemonopolywhichsheatpresentenjoys. Bythus
parting good friends, the natural affection of the colonies to the mother
countrywhich,perhaps,ourlatedissensionshavewellnighextinguished,
wouldquicklyrevive. Itmightdisposethemnotonlytorespect, forwhole

mothercityfromwhichtheydescended.
1359 [67] In order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which
it belongs, it ought to afford, in time of peace, a revenue to the public
sufficientnotonlyfordefrayingthewholeexpenseofitsownpeaceestab-
lishment, but for contributing its proportion to the support of the general
governmentoftheempire. Everyprovincenecessarilycontributes,moreor G.ed.p618
less,toincreasetheexpenseofthatgeneralgovernment. Ifanyparticular
province, therefore, does not contribute its share towards defraying this
expense, an unequal burden must be thrown upon some other part of the
empire. The extraordinary revenue, too, which every province affords to
the public in time of war, ought, from parity of reason, to bear the same
proportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire which its or-
dinary revenue does in time of peace. That neither the ordinary nor ex-
traordinary revenue which Great Britain derives from her colonies, bears
thisproportion tothe wholerevenue ofthe Britishempire, will readilybe
allowed. The monopoly, it has been supposed, indeed, by increasing the
478 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
privaterevenueofthepeopleofGreatBritain,andtherebyenablingthem
to pay greater taxes, compensates the deficiency of the public revenue of
the colonies. But this monopoly, I have endeavoured to show, though a
very grievous tax upon the colonies, and though it may increase the rev-
enue of a particular order of men in Great Britain, diminishes instead of
increasing that of the great body of the people; and consequently dimin-
ishesinsteadofincreasingtheabilityofthegreatbodyofthepeopletopay
taxes. The men, too, whose revenue the monopoly increases, constitute a
particular order, which it is both absolutely impossible to tax beyond the
proportion of other orders, and extremely impolitic even to attempt to tax
beyondthatproportion,asIshallendeavourtoshowinthefollowingbook.
Noparticularresource,therefore,canbedrawnfromthisparticularorder.
1360 [68] The colonies may be taxed either by their own assemblies, or by the G.ed.p619
ParliamentofGreatBritain.
1361 [69] That the colony assemblies can ever be so managed as to levy upon
their constituents a public revenue sufficient not only to maintain at all
times their own civil and military establishment, but to pay their proper
proportionoftheexpenseofthegeneralgovernmentoftheBritishempire
seemsnotveryprobable. ItwasalongtimebeforeeventheParliamentof
England,thoughplacedimmediatelyundertheeyeofthesovereign,could
bebroughtundersuchasystemofmanagement,orcouldberenderedsuf-
ficientlyliberalintheirgrantsforsupportingthecivilandmilitaryestab-
lishments even of their own country. It was only by distributing among
the particular Members of Parliament a great part either of the offices,
or of the disposal of the offices arising from this civil and military estab-
lishment, that such a system of management could be established even
with regard to the Parliament of England. But the distance of the colony
assemblies from the eye of the sovereign, their number, their dispersed
situation, and their various constitutions, would render it very difficult
to manage them in the same manner, even though the sovereign had the
same means of doing it; and those means are wanting. It would be abso-
lutely impossible to distribute among all the leading members of all the
colony assemblies such a share, either of the offices or of the disposal of
theofficesarisingfromthegeneralgovernmentoftheBritishempire,asto
disposethemtogiveuptheirpopularityathome,andtotaxtheirconstitu-
entsforthesupportofthatgeneralgovernment,ofwhichalmostthewhole

The unavoidable ignorance of administration, besides, concerning the re-
lative importance of the different members of those different assemblies,
theoffenceswhichmustfrequentlybegiven,theblunderswhichmustcon-
stantlybecommittedinattemptingtomanagetheminthismanner,seems
torendersuchasystemofmanagementaltogetherimpracticablewithre-
gardtothem.
1362 [70] The colony assemblies, besides, cannot be supposed the proper judges
ofwhatisnecessaryforthedefenceandsupportofthewholeempire. The
479 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
care of that defence and support is not entrusted to them. It is not their
business, and they have no regular means of information concerning it.
The assembly of a province, like the vestry of a parish, may judge very
properlyconcerningtheaffairsofitsownparticulardistrict;butcanhave
no proper means of judging concerning those of the whole empire. It can-
notevenjudgeproperlyconcerningtheproportionwhichitsownprovince
bears to the whole empire; or concerning the relative degree of its wealth
and importance compared with the other provinces; because those other
provinces are not under the inspection and superintendency of the as-
sembly of a particular province. What is necessary for the defence and
support of the whole empire, and in what proportion each part ought to G.ed.p620
contribute, canbejudgedofonlybythatassemblywhichinspectsandsu-
perintendstheaffairsofthewholeempire.
1363 [71] It has been proposed, accordingly, that the colonies should be taxed by
requisition, the Parliament of Great Britain determining the sum which
eachcolonyought topay, andthe provincial assemblyassessingandlevy-
ingitinthewaythatsuitedbestthecircumstancesoftheprovince. What
concerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the as-
sembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire;
andtheprovincialaffairsofeachcolonymightstillberegulatedbyitsown
assembly. Though the colonies should in this case have no representat-
ives in the British Parliament, yet, if we may judge by experience, there
is no probability that the Parliamentary requisition would be unreason-
able. The Parliament of England has not upon any occasion shown the
smallestdispositiontooverburdenthosepartsoftheempirewhicharenot
represented in Parliament. The islands of Guernsey and Jersey, without
anymeansofresistingtheauthorityofParliament,aremorelightlytaxed
than any part of Great Britain. Parliament in attempting to exercise its
supposed right, whether well or ill grounded, of taxing the colonies, has
never hitherto demanded of them anything which even approached to a
just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home. If the
contributionofthecolonies,besides,wastoriseorfallinproportiontothe
rise or fall of the land tax, Parliament could not tax them without taxing
atthesametimeitsownconstituents, andthecoloniesmightinthiscase
beconsideredasvirtuallyrepresentedinParliament.
1364 [72] Examples are not wanting of empires in which all the different
provinces are not taxed, if I may be allowed the expression, in one mass;
but in which the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought
to pay, and in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper;
while in others, he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective
states of each province shall determine. In some provinces of France, the
kingnotonlyimposeswhattaxeshethinksproper,butassessesandlevies
theminthewayhethinksproper. Fromothershedemandsacertainsum,
but leaves it to the states of each province to assess and levy that sum as
they think proper. According to the scheme of taxing by requisition, the
480 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Parliament of Great Britain would stand nearly in the same situation to-
wardsthecolonyassembliesastheKingofFrancedoestowardsthestates
of those provinces which still enjoy the privilege of having states of their
own,theprovincesofFrancewhicharesupposedtobethebestgoverned.
1365 [73] But though, according to this scheme, the colonies could have no just
reason to fear that their share of the public burdens should ever exceed
the proper proportion to that of their fellow-citizens at home; Great Bri- G.ed.p621
tain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to that
properproportion. TheParliamentofGreatBritainhasnotforsometime
pasthadthesameestablishedauthorityinthecolonies,whichtheFrench

readily advance their money upon the credit of a fund, which partly de-
pendeduponthegoodhumourofallthoseassemblies,fardistantfromthe
seat of the war, and sometimes, perhaps, thinking themselves not much
concerned in the event of it? Upon such a fund no more money would
probably be advanced than what the tax to be levied in Great Britain
might be supposed to answer for. The whole burden of the debt contrac-
tedonaccountofthewarwouldinthismannerfall,asitalwayshasdone
hitherto, upon Great Britain; upon a part of the empire, and not upon
the whole empire. Great Britain is, perhaps, since the world began, the
only state which, as it has extended its empire, has only increased its ex-
pensewithoutonceaugmentingitsresources. Otherstateshavegenerally
disburdened themselves upon their subject and subordinate provinces of
the most considerable part of the expense of defending the empire. Great
Britainhashithertosufferedhersubjectandsubordinateprovincestodis-
burdenthemselvesuponherofalmostthiswholeexpense. Inordertoput
Great Britain upon a footing of equality with her own colonies, which the
law has hitherto supposed to be subject and subordinate, it seems neces-
sary, upon the scheme of taxing them by Parliamentary requisition, that
Parliamentshouldhavesomemeansofrenderingitsrequisitionsimmedi-
ately effectual, in case the colony assemblies should attempt to evade or
rejectthem;andwhatthosemeansare,itisnotveryeasytoconceive,and
ithasnotyetbeenexplained.
1366 [74] ShouldtheParliamentofGreatBritain,atthesametime,beeverfully
established in the right of taxing the colonies, even independent of the
481 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
consentoftheirownassemblies,theimportanceofthoseassemblieswould
from that moment be at an end, and with it, that of all the leading men G.ed.p622
of British America. Men desire to have some share in the management
of public affairs chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them.
Upon the power which the greater part of the leading men, the natural
aristocracyofeverycountry,haveofpreservingordefendingtheirrespect-
iveimportance,dependsthestabilityanddurationofeverysystemoffree
government. Intheattackswhichthoseleadingmenarecontinuallymak-
ing upon the importance of one another, and in the defence of their own,
consiststhewholeplayofdomesticfactionandambition. Theleadingmen
of America, like those of all other countries, desire to preserve their own
importance. Theyfeel,orimagine,thatiftheirassemblies,whichtheyare
fondofcallingparliaments,andofconsideringasequalinauthoritytothe
Parliament of Great Britain, should be so far degraded as to become the
humble ministers and executive officers of that Parliament, the greater
part of their own importance would be at end. They have rejected, there-
fore, the proposal of being taxed by Parliamentary requisition, and like
other ambitious and high-spirited men, have rather chosen to draw the
swordindefenceoftheirownimportance.
1367 [75] TowardsthedeclensionoftheRomanrepublic,thealliesofRome,who
had borne the principal burden of defending the state and extending the
empire, demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of Roman citizens.
Upon being refused, the social war broke out. During the course of that
war,Romegrantedthoseprivilegestothegreaterpartofthemonebyone,
and in proportion as they detached themselves from the general confed-
eracy. The Parliament of Great Britain insists upon taxing the colonies;
and they refuse to be taxed by a Parliament in which they are not rep-
resented. If to each colony, which should detach itself from the general
confederacy, GreatBritainshouldallowsuchanumberofrepresentatives
assuitedtheproportionofwhatiscontributedtothepublicrevenueofthe

pensation admitted to the same freedom of trade with its fellow-subjects
at home; the number of its representatives to be augmented as the pro-
portion of its contribution might afterwards augment; a new method of
acquiring importance, a new and more dazzling object of ambition would
bepresentedtotheleadingmenofeachcolony. Insteadofpiddlingforthe G.ed.p623
little prizes which are to be found in what may be called the paltry raffle
of colony faction; they might then hope, from the presumption which men
naturally have in their own ability and good fortune, to draw some of the
great prizes which sometimes come from the wheel of the great state lot-
tery of British polities. Unless this or some other method is fallen upon,
and there seems to be none more obvious than this, of preserving the im-
portance and of gratifying the ambition of the leading men of America, it
is not very probable that they will ever voluntarily submit to us; and we
ought to consider that the blood which must be shed in forcing them to
482 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
do so is, every drop of it, blood either of those who are, or of those whom
we wish to have for our fellow citizens. They are very weak who flatter
themselves that, in the state to which things have come, our colonies will
be easily conquered by force alone. The persons who now govern the res-
olutions of what they call their Continental Congress, feel in themselves
at this moment a degree of importance which, perhaps, the greatest sub-
jects in Europe scarce feel. From shopkeepers, tradesmen, and attornies,
they are become statesmen and legislators, and are employed in contriv-
inganewformofgovernmentforanextensiveempire,which,theyflatter
themselves, will become, and which, indeed, seems very likely to become,
one of the greatest and most formidable that ever was in the world. Five
hundred different people, perhaps, who in different ways act immediately
undertheContinentalCongress;andfivehundredthousand,perhaps,who
actunderthosefivehundred,allfeelinthesamemanneraproportionable
rise in their own importance. Almost every individual of the governing
party in America fills, at present in his own fancy, a station superior, not
onlytowhathehadeverfilledbefore,buttowhathehadeverexpectedto
fill; and unless some new object of ambition is presented either to him or
tohisleaders,ifhehastheordinaryspiritofaman,hewilldieindefence
ofthatstation.
1368 [76] It is a remark of the president Henaut, that we now read with pleas-
ure the account of many little transactions of the Ligue, which when they
happened were not perhaps considered as very important pieces of news.
Buteverymanthen,sayshe,fanciedhimselfofsomeimportance;andthe G.ed.p624
innumerablememoirswhichhavecomedowntousfromthosetimes,were,
thegreaterpartofthem,writtenbypeoplewhotookpleasureinrecording
andmagnifyingeventsinwhich,theyflatteredthemselves,theyhadbeen
considerable actors. How obstinately the city of Paris upon that occasion
defended itself, what a dreadful famine it supported rather than submit
to the best and afterwards to the most beloved of all the French kings, is
well known. The greater part of the citizens, or those who governed the
greater part of them, fought in defence of their own importance, which
theyforesawwastobeatanendwhenevertheancientgovernmentshould
bere-established. Ourcolonies,unlesstheycanbeinducedtoconsenttoa
union, are very likely to defend themselves against the best of all mother
countries as obstinately as the city of Paris did against one of the best of
kings.
1369 [77] The idea of representation was unknown in ancient times. When the
people of one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in another,
they had no other means of exercising that right but by coming in a body
tovoteanddeliberatewiththepeopleofthatotherstate. Theadmissionof
the greater part of the inhabitants of Italy to the privileges of Roman cit-
izens completely ruined the Roman republic. It was no longer possible to
distinguish between who was and who was not a Roman citizen. No tribe
couldknowitsownmembers. Arabbleofanykindcouldbeintroducedinto
483 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the assemblies of the people, could drive out the real citizens, and decide
upon the affairs of the republic as if they themselves had been such. But
though America were to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parlia-
ment, the doorkeeper of the House of Commons could not find any great
difficulty in distinguishing between who was and who was not a member.
Though the Roman constitution, therefore, was necessarily ruined by the
union of Rome with the allied states of Italy, there is not the least prob-
ability that the British constitution would be hurt by the union of Great
Britain with her colonies. That constitution, on the contrary, would be
completedbyit,andseemstobeimperfectwithoutit. Theassemblywhich
deliberatesanddecidesconcerningtheaffairsofeverypartoftheempire,
in order to be properly informed, ought certainly to have representatives
fromeverypartofitThatthisunion,however,couldbeeasilyeffectuated,
or that difficulties and great difficulties might not occur in the execution,
I do not pretend. I have yet heard of none, however, which appear insur- G.ed.p625
mountable. The principal perhaps arise, not from the nature of things,
butfromtheprejudicesandopinionsofthepeoplebothonthisandonthe
othersideoftheAtlantic.
1370 [78] We,onthissideofthewater,areafraidlestthemultitudeofAmerican
representatives should overturn the balance of the constitution, and in-
crease too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand, or the
forceofthedemocracyontheother. ButifthenumberofAmericanrepres-
entativesweretobeinproportiontotheproduceofAmericantaxation,the
number of people to be managed would increase exactly in proportion to
the means of managing them; and the means of managing to the number
of people to be managed. The monarchical and democratical parts of the
constitution would, after the union, stand exactly in the same degree of
relativeforcewithregardtooneanotherastheyhaddonebefore.
1371 [79] The people on the other side of the water are afraid lest their distance
fromtheseatofgovernmentmightexposethemtomanyoppressions. But
their representatives in Parliament, of which the number ought from the
first to be considerable, would easily be able to protect them from all op-
pression. Thedistancecouldnotmuchweakenthedependencyoftherep-

1372 [80] The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by
the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events
recordedinthehistoryofmankind. Theirconsequenceshavealreadybeen
very great; but, in the short period of between two and three centuries
whichhaselapsedsincethesediscoveriesweremade,itisimpossiblethat
the whole extent of their consequences can have been seen. What bene-
fitsorwhatmisfortunestomankindmayhereafterresultfromthosegreat
events, no human wisdom can foresee. By uniting, in some measure, the
mostdistantpartsoftheworld, byenablingthemtorelieveoneanother’s
wants, to increase one another’s enjoyments, and to encourage one an-
other’sindustry,theirgeneraltendencywouldseemtobebeneficial. Tothe
nativeshowever,bothoftheEastandWestIndies,allthecommercialbene-
fitswhichcanhaveresultedfromthoseeventshavebeensunkandlostin
the dreadful misfortunes which they have occasioned. These misfortunes,
however, seem to have arisen rather from accident than from anything in
the nature of those events themselves. At the particular time when these
discoveriesweremade,thesuperiorityofforcehappenedtobesogreaton
thesideoftheEuropeansthattheywereenabledtocommitwithimpunity
every sort of injustice in those remote countries. Hereafter, perhaps, the
nativesofthosecountriesmaygrowstronger,orthoseofEuropemaygrow
weaker, andtheinhabitantsofallthedifferentquartersoftheworldmay
arrive at that equality of courage and force which, by inspiring mutual
fear,canaloneoverawetheinjusticeofindependentnationsintosomesort
of respect for the rights of one another. But nothing seems more likely to G.ed.p627
establish this equality of force than that mutual communication of know-
ledgeandofallsortsofimprovementswhichanextensivecommercefrom
allcountriestoallcountriesnaturally,orrathernecessarily,carriesalong
withit.
1373 [81] In the mean time one of the principal effects of those discoveries has
been to raise the mercantile system to a degree of splendour and glory
which it could never otherwise have attained to. It is the object of that
system to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactures than
by the improvement and cultivation of land, rather by the industry of the
townsthanbythatofthecountry. But,inconsequenceofthosediscoveries,
the commercial towns of Europe, instead of being the manufacturers and
carriers for but a very small part of the world (that part of Europe which
is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, and the countries which lie round the
Baltic and Mediterranean seas), have now become the manufacturers for
thenumerousandthrivingcultivatorsofAmerica,andthecarriers,andin
some respects the manufacturers too, for almost all the different nations
of Asia, Africa, and America. Two new worlds have been opened to their
industry,eachofthemmuchgreaterandmoreextensivethantheoldone,
andthemarketofoneofthemgrowingstillgreaterandgreatereveryday.
485 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1374 [82] The countries which possess the colonies of America, and which trade
directly to the East Indies, enjoy, indeed, the whole show and splendour
ofthisgreatcommerce. Othercountries,however,notwithstandingallthe
invidiousrestraintsbywhichitismeanttoexcludethem,frequentlyenjoy
a greater share of the real benefit of it. The colonies of Spain and Por-
tugal, forexample, givemorerealencouragementtotheindustryofother
countriesthantothatofSpainandPortugal. Inthesinglearticleoflinen
alone the consumption of those colonies amounts, it is said, but I do not
pretend to warrant the quantity, to more than three millions sterling a
year. But this great consumption is almost entirely supplied by France,
Flanders, Holland, andGermany. SpainandPortugalfurnishbutasmall
partofit. Thecapitalwhichsuppliesthecolonieswiththisgreatquantity
oflinenisannuallydistributedamong, andfurnishesarevenuetothein-
habitantsof,thoseothercountries. TheprofitsofitonlyarespentinSpain
and Portugal, where they help to support the sumptuous profusion of the
merchantsofCadizandLisbon.
1375 [83] Even the regulations by which each nation endeavours to secure to it-
self the exclusive trade of its own colonies are frequently more hurtful to
thecountriesinfavourofwhichtheyareestablishedthantothoseagainst
whichtheyareestablished. Theunjustoppressionoftheindustryofother
countries falls back, if I may say so, upon the heads of the oppressors, G.ed.p628
andcrushestheirindustrymorethanitdoesthatofthoseothercountries.
By those regulations for example, the merchant of Hamburg must send
the linen which he destines for the American market to London, and he
must bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines for the Ger-
man market, becausehe can neither send theone directlyto Americanor
bringbacktheotherdirectlyfromthence. Bythisrestraintheisprobably
obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper, and to sell the one somewhat
cheaper, and to buy the other somewhat dearer than he otherwise might
have done; and his profits are probably somewhat abridged by means of
it. Inthistrade,however,betweenHamburgandLondon,hecertainlyre-

1376 [84] After all the unjust attempts, therefore, of every country in Europe to
engross to itself the whole advantage of the trade of its own colonies, no
country has yet been able to engross itself anything but the expense of
supporting in time of peace and of defending in time of war the oppress-
ive authority which it assumes over them. The inconveniencies resulting
from the possession of its colonies, every country has engrossed to itself
completely. Theadvantagesresultingfromtheirtradeithasbeenobliged
tosharewithmanyothercountries.
1377 [85] Atfirstsight,nodoubt,themonopolyofthegreatcommerceofAmerica
naturallyseemstobeanacquisitionofthehighestvalue. Totheundiscern-
ing eye of giddy ambition, it naturally presents itself amidst the confused
scramble of politics and war as a very dazzling object to fight for. The

ous to that country. If it is employed in the carrying trade, the country to
which it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries
whosetradethatstockcarrieson. Buttheownerofthatstocknecessarily
wishes to dispose of as great a part of those goods as he can at home. He
therebysaveshimselfthetrouble,risk,andexpenseofexportation,andhe
will upon that account be glad to sell them at home, not only for a much
smaller price, but with somewhat a smaller profit than he might expect
to make by sending them abroad. He naturally, therefore, endeavours as
muchashecantoturnhiscarryingtradeintoaforeigntradeofconsump-
tion. If his stock, again, is employed in a foreign trade of consumption,
he will, for the same reason, be glad to dispose of at home as great a part
as he can of the home goods, which he collects in order to export to some
foreignmarket,andhewillthusendeavour,asmuchashecan,toturnhis
foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. The mercantile stock of
everycountrynaturallycourtsinthismannerthenear,andshunsthedis-
tant employment; naturally courts the employment in which the returns
arefrequent,andshunsthatinwhichtheyaredistantandslow;naturally
courts the employment in which it can maintain the greatest quantity of
productivelabourinthecountrytowhichitbelongs,orinwhichitsowner
resides,andshunsthatinwhichitcanmaintaintherethesmallestquant-
ity. It naturally courts the employment which in ordinary cases is most
advantageous,andshunsthatwhichinordinarycasesisleastadvantage-
oustothatcountry.
1379 [87] But if in any of those distant employments, which in ordinary cases
are less advantageous to the country, the profit should happen to rise
487 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
somewhat higher than what is sufficient to balance the natural prefer-
ence which is given to nearer employments, this superiority of profit will
draw stock from those nearer employments, till the profits of all return
to their proper level. This superiority of profit, however, is a proof that,
in the actual circumstances of the society, those distant employments are
somewhatunderstockedinproportiontootheremployments,andthatthe
stock of the society is not distributed in the properest manner among all
the different employments carried on in it. It is a proof that something is
either bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be, and that some
particularclassofcitizensismoreorlessoppressedeitherbypayingmore
or by getting less than what is suitable to that equality which ought to
take place, and which naturally does take place among all the different
classes of them. Though the same capital never will maintain the same
quantity of productive labour in a distant as in a near employment, yet
a distant employment may be as necessary for the welfare of the society
as a near one; the goods which the distant employment deals in being ne- G.ed.p630
cessary, perhaps, for carrying on many of the nearer employments. But if
the profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level,
those goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be, or somewhat above
theirnaturalprice, andallthoseengagedintheneareremploymentswill
be more or less oppressed by this high price. Their interest, therefore, in
thiscaserequiresthatsomestockshouldbewithdrawnfromthosenearer
employments, and turned towards that distant one, in order to reduce its
profitstotheirproperlevel,andthepriceofthegoodswhichitdealsinto
theirnaturalprice. Inthisextraordinarycase,thepublicinterestrequires
that some stock should be withdrawn from those employments which in
ordinary cases are more advantageous, and turned towards one which in
ordinary cases is less advantageous to the public; and in this extraordin-
ary case the natural interests and inclinations of men coincide as exactly
with the public interest as in all other ordinary cases, and lead them to
withdraw stock from the near, and to turn it towards the distant employ-
ment.
1380 [88] It is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals nat-
urally dispose them to turn their stocks towards the employments which
in ordinary cases are most advantageous to the society. But if from this
natural preference they should turn too much of it towards those employ-
ments,thefallofprofitinthemandtheriseofitinallothersimmediately
dispose them to alter this faulty distribution. Without any intervention
of law, therefore, the private interests and passions of men naturally lead
them to divide and distribute the stock of every society among all the dif-
ferentemploymentscarriedoninitasnearlyaspossibleintheproportion
whichismostagreeabletotheinterestofthewholesociety.
1381 [89] All the different regulations of the mercantile system necessarily de-
range more or less this natural and most advantageous distribution of
stock. But those which concern the trade to America and the East Indies
488 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
derange it perhaps more than any other, because the trade to those two
great continents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other
branches of trade. The regulations, however, by which this derangement
is effected in those two different branches of trade are not altogether the
same. Monopoly is the great engine of both; but it is a different sort of
monopoly. Monopoly of one kind or another, indeed, seems to be the sole
engineofthemercantilesystem.
1382 [90] In the trade to America every nation endeavours to engross as much G.ed.p631
as possible the whole market of its own colonies by fairly excluding all
other nations from any direct trade to them. During the greater part of
thesixteenthcentury,thePortugueseendeavouredtomanagethetradeto
theEastIndiesinthesamemanner,byclaimingthesolerightofsailingin
theIndianseas, onaccountofthemeritofhavingfirstfoundouttheroad
to them. The Dutch still continue to exclude all other European nations
from any direct trade to their spice islands. Monopolies of this kind are
evidentlyestablishedagainstallotherEuropeannations,whoarethereby
notonlyexcludedfromatradetowhichitmightbeconvenientforthemto
turn some part of their stock, but are obliged to buy the goods which that
tradedealsinsomewhatdearerthaniftheycouldimportthemthemselves
directlyfromthecountrieswhichproducethem.
1383 [91] But since the fall of the power of Portugal, no European nation has
claimedtheexclusiverightofsailingintheIndianseas,ofwhichtheprin-
cipal ports are now open to the ships of all European nations. Except in
Portugal, however, and within these few years in France, the trade to the
EastIndieshasineveryEuropeancountrybeensubjectedtoanexclusive

onlyexcludedfromatradetowhichitmightbeconvenientforthemtoturn

Since the establishment of the English East India Company, for example,
theotherinhabitantsofEngland,overandabovebeingexcludedfromthe
trade,musthavepaidinthepriceoftheEastIndiagoodswhichtheyhave
consumed, not only for all the extraordinary profits which the company
mayhavemadeuponthosegoodsinconsequenceoftheirmonopoly,butfor
all the extraordinary waste which the fraud and abuse, inseparable from
the management of the affairs of so great a company, must necessarily
haveoccasioned. Theabsurdityofthissecondkindofmonopoly,therefore,
ismuchmoremanifestthanthatofthefirst.
1384 [92] Boththesekindsofmonopoliesderangemoreorlessthenaturaldistri-
butionofthestockofthesociety; buttheydonotalwaysderangeitinthe
sameway.
1385 [93] Monopolies of the first kind always attract to the particular trade in
which they are established a greater proportion of the stock of the society
thanwhatwouldgotothattradeofitsownaccord.
489 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1386 [94] Monopolies of the second kind may sometimes attract stock towards
the particular trade in which they are established, and sometimes repel
it from that trade according to different circumstances. In poor countries G.ed.p632
theynaturallyattracttowardsthattrademorestockthanwouldotherwise
go to it. In rich countries they naturally repel from it a good deal of stock
whichwouldotherwisegotoit.
1387 [95] SuchpoorcountriesasSwedenandDenmark,forexample,wouldprob-
ablyhaveneversentasingleshiptotheEastIndieshadnotthetradebeen
subjected to an exclusive company. The establishment of such a company
necessarilyencouragesadventurers. Theirmonopolysecuresthemagainst
all competitors in the home market, and they have the same chance for
foreign markets with the traders of other nations. Their monopoly shows
themthecertaintyofagreatprofituponaconsiderablequantityofgoods,
and the chance of a considerable profit upon a great quantity. Without
suchextraordinaryencouragement,thepoortradersofsuchpoorcountries
wouldprobablyneverhavethoughtofhazardingtheirsmallcapitalsinso
very distant and uncertain an adventure as the trade to the East Indies
mustnaturallyhaveappearedtothem.
1388 [96] SucharichcountryasHolland,onthecontrary,wouldprobably,inthe
case of a free trade, send many more ships to the East Indies than it ac-
tually does. The limited stock of the Dutch East India Company probably
repels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which would oth-
erwise go to it. The mercantile capital of Holland is so great that it is,
asitwere,continuallyoverflowing,sometimesintothepublicfundsoffor-
eign countries, sometimes into loans to private traders and adventurers
of foreign countries, sometimes into the most round-about foreign trades
of consumption, and sometimes into the carrying trade. All near employ-
ments being completely filled up, all the capital which can be placed in
them with any tolerable profit being already placed in them, the capital
of Holland necessarily flows towards the most distant employments. The
trade to the East Indies, if it were altogether free, would probably absorb
the greater part of this redundant capital. The East Indies offer a mar-
ket for the manufactures of Europe and for the gold and silver as well as
for several other productions of Americagreater andmore extensivethan
bothEuropeandAmericaputtogether.
1389 [97] Every derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily
hurtful to the society in which it takes place; whether it be by repelling
from a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to it, or by
attractingtowardsaparticulartradethatwhichwouldnototherwisecome
to it. If, without any exclusive company, the trade of Holland to the East G.ed.p633
Indies would be greater than it actually is, that country must suffer a
considerablelossbypartofitscapitalbeingexcludedfromtheemployment
most convenient for that part. And in the same manner, if, without an
exclusive company, the trade of Sweden and Denmark to the East Indies
wouldbelessthanitactuallyis,or,whatperhapsismoreprobable,would
490 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
not exist at all, those two countries must likewise suffer a considerable
loss by part of their capital being drawn into an employment which must
bemoreorlessunsuitabletotheirpresentcircumstances. Betterforthem,
perhaps, in their present circumstances, to buy East India goods of other
nations, even though they should pay somewhat dearer, than to turn so
great a part of their small capital to so very distant a trade, in which the
returns are so very slow, in which that capital can maintain so small a
quantityofproductivelabourathome,whereproductivelabourissomuch
wanted,wheresolittleisdone,andwheresomuchistodo.
1390 [98] Though without an exclusive company, therefore, a particular country
shouldnotbeabletocarryonanydirecttradetotheEastIndies,itwillnot
fromthencefollowthatsuchacompanyoughttobeestablishedthere,but
onlythatsuchacountryoughtnotinthesecircumstancestotradedirectly
to the East Indies. That such companies are not in general necessary for
carryingontheEastIndiatradeissufficientlydemonstratedbytheexper-
ience of the Portuguese, who enjoyed almost the whole of it for more than
acenturytogetherwithoutanyexclusivecompany.
1391 [99] Noprivatemerchant,ithasbeensaid,couldwellhavecapitalsufficient
to maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the East Indies,
in order to provide goods for the ships which he might occasionally send
thither; and yet, unless he was able to do this, the difficulty of finding a
cargo might frequently make his ships lose the season for returning, and
the expense of so long a delay would not only eat up the whole profit of
theadventure,butfrequentlyoccasionaveryconsiderableloss. Thisargu-
ment, however, if it proved anything at all, would prove that no one great
branch of trade could be carried on without an exclusive company, which
is contrary to the experience of all nations. There is no great branch of
tradeinwhichthecapitalofanyoneprivatemerchantissufficientforcar-
ryingonallthesubordinatebrancheswhichmustbecarriedon,inorderto

of trade, some merchants naturally turn their capitals towards the prin-
cipal,andsometowardsthesubordinatebranchesofit;andthoughallthe
different branches of it are in this manner carried on, yet it very seldom
happensthattheyareallcarriedonbythecapitalofoneprivatemerchant.
If a nation, therefore, is ripe for the East India trade, a certain portion of G.ed.p634
its capital will naturally divide itself among all the different branches of
that trade. Some of its merchants will find it for their interest to reside
in the East Indies, and to employ their capitals there in providing goods
for the ships which are to be sent out by other merchants who reside in
Europe. ThesettlementswhichdifferentEuropeannationshaveobtained
in the East Indies, if they were taken from the exclusive companies to
which they at present belong and put under the immediate protection of
the sovereign, would render this residence both safe and easy, at least to
themerchantsoftheparticularnationstowhomthosesettlementsbelong.
If at any particular time that part of the capital of any country which of
491 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
its own accord tended and inclined, if I may say so, towards the East In-
diatrade,wasnotsufficientforcarryingonallthosedifferentbranchesof
it, it would be a proof that, at that particular time, that country was not
ripe for that trade, and that it would do better to buy for some time, even
at a higher price, from other European nations, the East India goods it
had occasion for, than to import them itself directly from the East Indies.
What it might lose by the high price of those goods could seldom be equal
tothelosswhichitwouldsustainbythedistractionofalargeportionofits
capital from other employments more necessary, or more useful, or more
suitabletoitscircumstancesandsituation,thanadirecttradetotheEast
Indies.
1392 [100] Though the Europeans possess many considerable settlements both
upon the coast of Africa and in the East Indies, they have not yet estab-
lishedineitherofthosecountriessuchnumerousandthrivingcoloniesas
those in the islands and continent of America. Africa, however, as well
as several of the countries comprehended under the general name of the
East Indies, are inhabited by barbarous nations. But those nations were
bynomeanssoweakanddefencelessasthemiserableandhelplessAmer-
icans;andinproportiontothenaturalfertilityofthecountrieswhichthey

nationseitherofAfricaoroftheEastIndieswereshepherds;eventheHot-
tentots were so. But the natives of every part of America, except Mexico
andPeru,wereonlyhunters;andthedifferenceisverygreatbetweenthe
numberofshepherdsandthatofhunterswhomthesameextentofequally
fertile territory can maintain. In Africa and the East Indies, therefore,
it was more difficult to displace the natives, and to extend the European
plantations over the greater part of the lands of the original inhabitants.
Thegeniusofexclusivecompanies,besides,isunfavourable,ithasalready
been observed, to the growth of new colonies, and has probably been the G.ed.p635
principal cause of the little progress which they have made in the East
Indies. The Portuguese carried on the trade both to Africa and the East
Indies without any exclusive companies, and their settlements at Congo,
Angola,andBenguelaonthecoastofAfrica,andatGoaintheEastIndies,
thoughmuchdepressedbysuperstitionandeverysortofbadgovernment,

erations. TheDutchsettlementsattheCapeofGoodHopeandatBatavia
are at present the most considerable colonies which the Europeans have
established either in Africa or in the East Indies, and both these settle-
ments are peculiarly fortunate in their situation. The Cape of Good Hope
wasinhabitedbyaraceofpeoplealmostasbarbarousandquiteasincap-
able of defending themselves as the natives of America. It is besides the
halfwayhouse, ifonemaysayso, betweenEuropeandtheEastIndies, at
whichalmosteveryEuropeanshipmakessomestay,bothingoingandre-
turning. The supplying of those ships with every sort of fresh provisions,
492 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
with fruit and sometimes with wine, affords alone a very extensive mar-
ket for the surplus produce of the colonists. What the Cape of Good Hope
is between Europe and every part of the East Indies, Batavia is between
the principal countries of the East Indies. It lies upon the most frequen-
ted road from Indostan to China and Japan, and is nearly about midway
upon that road. Almost all the ships, too, that sail between Europe and
China touch at Batavia; and it is, over and above all this, the centre and
principal mart of what is called the country trade of the East Indies, not
only of that part of it which is carried on by Europeans, but of that which
is carried on by the native Indians; and vessels navigated by the inhab-
itants of China and Japan, of Tonquin, Malacca, Cochin China, and the
islandofCelebes,arefrequentlytobeseeninitsport. Suchadvantageous
situations have enabled those two colonies to surmount all the obstacles
which the oppressive genius of an exclusive company may have occasion-
allyopposedtotheirgrowth. TheyhaveenabledBataviatosurmountthe
additional disadvantage of perhaps the most unwholesome climate in the
world.
1393 [101] The English and Dutch companies, though they have established no
considerable colonies, except the two above mentioned, have both made

tosecuretheirownmonopolyistotakecarethatnomoreshallgrowthan

they have reduced the population of several of the Moluccas nearly to the

of the Portuguese, however, those islands are said to have been tolerably
well inhabited. The English company have not yet had time to establish

493 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
real reason, to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price
a large quantity of opium, which he happened then to have upon hand.
Upon other occasions the order has been reversed; and a rich field of rice
or other grain has been ploughed up, in order to make room for a planta-
tionofpoppies;whenthechiefforesawthatextraordinaryprofitwaslikely
to be made by opium. The servants of the company have upon several oc-
casions attempted to establish in their own favour the monopoly of some
of the most important branches, not only of the foreign, but of the inland
tradeofthecountry. Hadtheybeenallowedtogoon, itisimpossiblethat
they should not at some time or another have attempted to restrain the
production of the particular articles of which they had thus usurped the
monopoly,notonlytothequantitywhichtheythemselvescouldpurchase,
buttothatwhichtheycouldexpecttosellwithsuchaprofitastheymight
think sufficient. In the course of a century or two, the policy of the Eng- G.ed.p637
lish company would in this manner have probably proved as completely
destructiveasthatoftheDutch.
1394 [102] Nothing, however, can be more directly contrary to the real interest of
thosecompanies,consideredasthesovereignsofthecountrieswhichthey
have conquered, than this destructive plan. In almost all countries the
revenueofthesovereignisdrawnfromthatofthepeople. Thegreaterthe
revenue of the people, therefore, the greater the annual produce of their
land and labour, the more they can afford to the sovereign. It is his in-
terest,therefore,toincreaseasmuchaspossiblethatannualproduce. But
ifthisistheinterestofeverysovereign,itispeculiarlysoofonewhoserev-
enue, like that of the sovereign of Bengal, arises chiefly from a land-rent.
That rent must necessarily be in proportion to the quantity and value of
theproduce,andboththeoneandtheothermustdependupontheextent
of the market. The quantity will always be suited with more or less ex-
actness to the consumption of those who can afford to pay for it, and the
price which they will pay will always be in proportion to the eagerness of
their competition. It isthe interestof sucha sovereign, therefore, toopen
themostextensivemarketfortheproduceofhiscountry,toallowthemost
perfect freedom of commerce, in order to increase as much as possible the
number and the competition of buyers; and upon this account to abolish,
not only all monopolies, but all restraints upon the transportation of the
homeproducefromonepartofthecountrytoanother,uponitsexportation
toforeigncountries,orupontheimportationofgoodsofanykindforwhich
it can be exchanged. It is in this manner most likely to increase both the
quantity and value of that produce, and consequently of his own share of
it,orofhisownrevenue.
1395 [103] But a company of merchants are, it seems, incapable of considering
themselves as sovereigns, even after they have become such. Trade, or

our for this purpose to keep out as much as possible all competitors from
the market of the countries which are subject to their government, and
consequentlytoreduce,atleast,somepartofthesurplusproduceofthose G.ed.p638
countries to what is barely sufficient for supplying their own demand, or
to what they can expect to sell in Europe with such a profit as they may
think reasonable. Their mercantile habits draw them in this manner, al-
most necessarily, though perhaps insensibly, to prefer upon all ordinary
occasionsthelittleandtransitoryprofitofthemonopolisttothegreatand
permanent revenue of the sovereign, and would gradually lead them to
treat the countries subject to their government nearly as the Dutch treat
the Moluceas. It is the interest of the East India Company, considered
as sovereigns, that the European goods which are carried to their Indian
dominions should be sold there as cheap as possible; and that the Indian
goods which are brought from thence should bring there as good a price,
orshouldbesoldthereasdearaspossible. Butthereverseofthisistheir

withthatofthecountrywhichtheygovern. Asmerchantstheirinterestis
directlyoppositetothatinterest.
1396 [104] But if the genius of such a government, even as to what concerns its
direction in Europe, is in this manner essentially and perhaps incurably
faulty, that of its administration in India is still more so. That adminis-
tration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants, a profession no
doubtextremelyrespectable, butwhichinnocountryintheworldcarries
along with it that sort of authority which naturally overawes the people,
and without force commands their willing obedience. Such a council can
commandobedienceonlybythemilitaryforcewithwhichtheyareaccom-

upon their masters’ account, the European goods consigned to them, and
to buy in return Indian goods for the European market. It is to sell the
one as dear and to buy the other as cheap as possible, and consequently
toexcludeasmuchaspossibleallrivalsfromtheparticularmarketwhere
they keep their shop. The genius of the administration therefore, so far
asconcernsthetradeofthecompany, isthesameasthatofthedirection.
It tends to makegovernmentsubservient tothe interestof monopoly, and

The country belongs to their masters, who cannot avoid having some re-
gard for the interest of what belongs to them. But it does not belong to
the servants. The real interest of their masters, if they were capable of
496 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
understanding it, is the same with that of the country2, and it is from ig-
norance chiefly, and the meanness of mercantile prejudice, that they ever
oppress it. But the real interest of the servants is by no means the same

sarily put an end to their oppressions. The regulations accordingly which
have been sent out from Europe, though they have been frequently weak,
have upon most occasions been well-meaning. More intelligence and per-
haps less good-meaning has sometimes appeared in those established by
the servants in India. It is a very singular government in which every
member of the administration wishes to get out of the country, and con-
sequently to have done with the government as soon as he can, and to
whose interest, the day after he has left it and carried his whole fortune
with him, it is perfectly indifferent though the whole country was swal-
lowedupbyanearthquake.
1399 [107] Imeannot,however,byanythingwhichIhaveheresaid,tothrowany G.ed.p641
odious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the East
India Company, and much less upon that of any particular persons. It is
the system of government, the situation in which they are placed, that I
meantocensure,notthecharacterofthosewhohaveactedinit. Theyac-
tedastheirsituationnaturallydirected,andtheywhohaveclamouredthe

war and negotiation, the councils of Madras and Calcutta have upon sev-
eraloccasionsconductedthemselveswitharesolutionanddecisivewisdom
which would have done honour to the senate of Rome in the best days of
that republic. The members of those councils, however, had been bred to

CONCLUSION OF THE MERCANTILE
SYSTEM
1401 [1] THOUGHtheencouragementofexportationandthediscouragementofim-
portation are the two great engines by which the mercantile system pro-
posestoenricheverycountry,yetwithregardtosomeparticularcommod-
ities it seems to follow an opposite plan: to discourage exportation and to
encourageimportation. Itsultimateobject,however,itpretends,isalways
the same, to enrich the country by an advantageous balance of trade. It
discouragestheexportationofthematerialsofmanufacture,andofthein-
struments of trade, in order to give our own workmen an advantage, and
to enable them to undersell those of other nations in all foreign markets;
and by restraining, in this manner, the exportation of a few commodities,
ofnogreatprice,itproposestooccasionamuchgreaterandmorevaluable
exportation of others. It encourages the importation of the materials of
manufacture in order that our own people may be enabled to work them
upmorecheaply,andtherebypreventagreaterandmorevaluableimport-
ation of the manufactured commodities. I do not observe, at least in our
Statute Book, any encouragement given to the importation of the instru-
ments of trade. When manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of
greatness, the fabrication of the instruments of trade becomes itself the
object of a great number of very important manufactures. To give any
particular encouragement to the importation of such instruments would
interfere too much with the interest of those manufactures. Such import-
ation, therefore, instead of being encouraged, has frequently been prohib-
ited. Thus the importation of wool cards, except from Ireland, or when
brought in as wreck or prize goods, was prohibited by the 3rd of Edward
IV;whichprohibitionwasrenewedbythe39thofElizabeth,andhasbeen
continuedandrenderedperpetualbysubsequentlaws.
1402 [2] The importation of the materials of manufacture has sometimes been
encouragedbyanexemptionfromthedutiestowhichothergoodsaresub-
ject,andsometimesbybounties.

manufacturersmay, perhaps, haveextortedfromthelegislaturetheseex-
emptions as well as the greater part of our other commercial regulations.
Theyare,however,perfectlyjustandreasonable,andif,consistentlywith

1404 [4] Theavidityofourgreatmanufacturers,however,hasinsomecasesex-
tendedtheseexemptionsagooddealbeyondwhatcanjustlybeconsidered
as the rude materials of their work. By the 24 Geo. III. chap. 46, a small

ofbrownlinenyarnwastakenaway. Inthedifferentoperations,however,
which are necessary for the preparation of linen yarn, a good deal more
industry is employed than in the subsequent operation of preparing linen
cloth from linen yarn. To say nothing of the industry of the flax-growers G.ed.p644
and flax-dressers, three or four spinners, at least, are necessary in order
to keep one weaver in constant employment; and more than four-fifths of
thewholequantityoflabournecessaryforthepreparationoflinenclothis
employed in that of linen yarn; but our spinners are poor people, women
commonly scattered about in all different parts of the country, without
support or protection. It is not by the sale of their work, but by that of
the complete work of the weavers, that our great master manufacturers
maketheirprofits. Asitistheirinteresttosellthecompletemanufacture
as dear, so is it to buy the materials as cheap as possible. By extorting
fromthelegislaturebountiesupontheexportationoftheirownlinen,high
duties upon the importation of all foreign linen, and a total prohibition of
the home consumption of some sorts of French linen, they endeavour to
sell their own goods as dear as possible. By encouraging the importation
of foreign linen yarn, and thereby bringing it into competition with that
which is made by our own people, they endeavour to buy the work of the
poor spinners as cheap as possible. They are as intent to keep down the
wagesoftheirownweaversastheearningsofthepoorspinners, anditis

It is the industry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the

fifteenyears,butcontinuedbytwodifferentprolongations,expirewiththe
end of the session of Parliament which shall immediately follow the 24th

1407 [7] Thefirstbountiesofthiskindwerethosegrantedaboutthebeginning

Under this denomination were comprehended timber fit for masts, yards,
and bowsprits; hemp; tar, pitch, and turpentine. The bounty, however, of
one pound the ton upon masting-timber, and that of six pounds the ton G.ed.p645
upon hemp, were extended to such as should be imported into England
from Scotland. Both these bounties continued without any variation, at
the same rate, till they were severally allowed to expire; that upon hemp
on the 1st of January 1741, and that upon masting-timber at the end of
thesessionofParliamentimmediatelyfollowingthe24thJune1781.
1408 [8] Thebountiesupontheimportationoftar,pitch,andturpentineunder-
went, during their continuance, several alterations. Originally that upon
tarwasfourpoundstheton;thatuponpitchthesame;andthatupontur-
pentine, three pounds the ton. The bounty of four pounds the ton upon
tar was afterwards confined to such as had been prepared in a particular
manner; that upon other good, clean, and merchantable tar was reduced
to two pounds four shillings the ton. The bounty upon pitch was likewise
reducedtoonepound;andthatuponturpentinetoonepoundtenshillings
theton.
1409 [9] Thesecondbountyupontheimportationofanyofthematerialsofman-
ufacture, according to the order of time, was that granted by the 21st
GeorgeII.chap.30,upontheimportationofindigofromtheBritishplant-
ations. Whentheplantationindigowasworththree-fourthsofthepriceof
the best French indigo, it was by this act entitled to a bounty of sixpence
the pound. This bounty, which, like most others, was granted only for a
limited time, was continued by several prolongations, but was reduced to
fourpence the pound. It was allowed to expire with the end of the session
ofParliamentwhichfollowedthe25thMarch1781.
1410 [10] The third bounty of this kind was that granted (much about the time
thatwewerebeginningsometimestocourtandsometimestoquarrelwith

ofhemp,orundressedflax,fromtheBritishplantations. Thisbountywas
granted for twenty-one years, from the 24th June 1764 to the 24th June
1785. For the first seven years it was to be at the rate of eight pounds
the ton, for the second at six pounds, and for the third at four pounds. G.ed.p646

It was not extended to Scotland, of which the climate (although hemp is
sometimes raised there in small quantities and of an inferior quality) is

[11] The fourth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 5th Geo. III.
1411
chap. 45, upon the importation of wood from America. It was granted for
nineyears,fromthe1stJanuary1766tothe1stJanuary1775. Duringthe

[12] The fifth bounty of this kind was that granted by the 9th Geo. III.
1412

Itwasgrantedfortwenty-oneyears,fromthe1stJanuary1770tothe1st

five pounds for every hundred pounds value; for the second at twenty

worm, and the preparation of silk, requires so much hand labour, and la-
bour is so very dear in America that even this great bounty, I have been
informed,wasnotlikelytoproduceanyconsiderableeffect.
1413 [13] Thesixthbountyofthiskindwasthatgrantedby2ndGeo.III.chap.50,
fortheimportationofpipe,hogshead,andbarrelstavesandheadingfrom

24thJune1800. Thistermisdivided,likewise,intothreeperiodsofseven
years each; and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty is G.ed.p647
the same with that of the American. It does not, however, like the Amer-
ican bounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax. It would have
been too great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great
Britain. When this last bounty was granted, the British and Irish legis-
latureswerenotinmuchbetterhumourwithoneanotherthantheBritish
andAmericanhadbeenbefore. ButthisboontoIreland,itistobehoped,

1415 [15] The same commodities upon which we thus gave bounties when im-
portedfromAmericaweresubjectedtoconsiderabledutieswhenimported
501 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
from any other country. The interest of our American colonies was re-
garded as the same with that of the mother country. Their wealth was
considered as our wealth. Whatever money was sent out to them, it was
said, came all back to us by the balance of trade, and we could never be-
come a farthing the poorer by any expense which we could lay out upon
them. Theywereourownineveryrespect,anditwasanexpenselaidout
upon the improvement of our own property and for the profitable employ-
ment of our own people. It is unnecessary, I apprehend, at present to say
anything further in order to expose the folly of a system which fatal ex-
perience has now sufficiently exposed. Had our American colonies really
been a part of Great Britain, those bounties might have been considered
as bounties upon production, and would still have been liable to all the
objectionstowhichsuchbountiesareliable,buttonoother.

1417 [17] Our woollen manufacturers have been more successful than any other
class of workmen in persuading the legislature that the prosperity of the
nation depended upon the success and extension of their particular busi-
ness. They have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers by
anabsoluteprohibitionofimportingwoollenclothsfromanyforeigncoun-
try, but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the sheep
farmers and growers of wool by a similar prohibition of the exportation of
live sheep and wool. The severity of many of the laws which have been
enacted for the security of the revenue is very justly complained of, as
imposing heavy penalties upon actions which, antecedent to the statutes
that declared them to be crimes, had always been understood to be inno- G.ed.p648
cent. But the cruellest of our revenue laws, I will venture to affirm, are
mild and gentle in comparison of some of those which the clamour of our
merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature for the
support of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies. Like the laws of
Draco,theselawsmaybesaidtobeallwritteninblood.
1418 [18] By the 8th of Elizabeth, chap. 3, the exporter of sheep, lambs, or rams
was for the first offence to forfeit all his goods for ever, to suffer a year’s
imprisonment, and then to have his left hand cut off in a market town
upon a market day, to be there nailed up; and for the second offence to be
adjudged a felon, and to suffer death accordingly. To prevent the breed of
our sheep from being propagated in foreign countries seems to have been
the object of this law. By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 18, the
exportation of wool was made felony, and the exporter subjected to the
samepenaltiesandforfeituresasafelon.
1419 [19] For the honour of the national humanity, it is to be hoped that neither
ofthesestatuteswereeverexecuted. Thefirstofthem,however;sofaras
I know, has never been directly repealed, and Serjeant Hawkins seems to
consideritasstillinforce. Itmayhowever, perhaps, beconsideredasvir-
tuallyrepealedbythe12thofCharlesII.chap.32,sect.3,which,without
502 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
expressly taking away the penalties imposed by former statutes, imposes
a new penalty, viz., that of twenty shillings for every sheep exported, or
attempted to be exported, together with the forfeiture of the sheep and of
the owner’s share of the ship. The second of them was expressly repealed
by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 28, sect. 4. By which it is de-
clared that, ‘Whereas the statute of the 13th and 14th of King Charles II,
made against the exportation of wool, among other things in the said act
mentioned, doth enact the same to be deemed felony; by the severity of G.ed.p649
whichpenaltytheprosecutionofoffendershathnotbeensoeffectuallyput
in execution: Be it, therefore, enacted by the authority aforesaid, that so
much of the said act, which relates to the making the said offence felony,
berepealedandmadevoid.’
1420 [20] The penalties, however, which are either imposed by this milder stat-
ute,orwhich,thoughimposedbyformerstatutes,arenotrepealedbythis
one,arestillsufficientlysevere. Besidestheforfeitureofthegoods,theex-

able to pay those heavy penalties, the law means to ruin him completely.

of that term, he is liable to the pains of felony, without benefit of clergy.

[21] In order to prevent exportation, the whole inland commerce of wool
1421
is laid under very burdensome and oppressive restrictions. It cannot be
packedinanybox,barrel,cask,case,chest,oranyotherpackage,butonly
inpacksofleatherorpack-cloth,onwhichmustbemarkedontheoutside
thewordswooloryarm,inlargelettersnotlessthanthreeincheslong,on
pain of forfeiting the same and the package, and three shillings for every
pound weight, to be paid by the owner or packer. It cannot be loaden on
any horse or cart, or carried by land within five miles of the coast, but
between sun-rising and sun-setting, on pain of forfeiting the same, the
horses and carriages. The hundred next adjoining to the sea-coast, out of
or through which the wool is carried or exported, forfeits twenty pounds, G.ed.p650
if the wool is under the value of ten pounds; and if of greater value, then
treblethatvalue,togetherwithtreblecosts,tobesuedforwithintheyear.

this penalty, he is to be imprisoned for five years; and any other person
mayprosecute. Theseregulationstakeplacethroughthewholekingdom.
[22] But in the particular counties of Kent and Sussex, the restrictions are
1422
still more troublesome. Every owner of wool within ten miles of the sea-
coast must given an account in writing, three days after shearing to the
next officer of the customs, of the number of his fleeces, and of the places
where they are lodged. And before he removes any part of them he must
give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces, and of the
name and abode of the person to whom they are sold, and of the place
to which it is intended they should be carried. No person within fifteen
miles of the sea, in the said counties, can buy any wool before he enters
into bond to the king that no part of the wool which he shall so buy shall
be sold by him to any other person within fifteen miles of the sea. If any
wool is found carrying towards the sea-side in the said counties, unless it
has been entered and security given as aforesaid, it is forfeited, and the
offenderalsoforfeitsthreeshillingsforeverypoundweight. Ifanyperson
lays any wool not entered as aforesaid within fifteen miles of the sea, it
must be seized and forfeited; and if, after such seizure, any person claim
the same, he must give security to the Exchequer that if he is cast upon
trialheshallpaytreblecosts,besidesallotherpenalties.
1423 [23] Whensuchrestrictionsareimposedupontheinlandtrade,thecoasting
trade, we may believe, cannot be left very free. Every owner of wool who
carriesorcausestobecarriedanywooltoanyportorplaceontheseacoast,
inordertobefromthencetransportedbyseatoanyotherplaceorporton
the coast, must first cause an entry thereof to be made at the port from
whence it is intended to be conveyed, containing the weight, marks, and
number of the packages, before he brings the same within five miles of
that port, on pain of forfeiting the same, and also the horses, carts, and
othercarriages;andalsoofsufferingandforfeitingasbytheotherlawsin
force against the exportation of wool. This law, however (1st William III.
chap.32),issoveryindulgentastodeclarethat,‘Thisshallnothinderany
person from carrying his wool home from the place of shearing, though it
be within five miles of the sea, provided that in ten days after shearing, G.ed.p651
and before he remove the wool, he do under his hand certify to the next
officer of the customs, the true number of fleeces, and where it is housed;
and do not remove the same, without certifying to such officer, under his
hand, his intention so to do, three days before.’ Bond must be given that
the wool to be carried coastways is to be landed at the particular port for
which it is entered outwards; and if any part of it is landed without the
presence of an officer, not only the forfeiture of the wool is incurred as in
other goods, but the usual additional penalty of three shillings for every
poundweightislikewiseincurred.
[24] Ourwoollenmanufactures,inordertojustifytheirdemandofsuchex-
1424
504 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
traordinary restrictions and regulations, confidently asserted that Eng-
lish wool was of a peculiar quality, superior to that of any other country;
that the wool of other countries could not, without some mixture of it, be
wrought up into any tolerable manufacture; that fine cloth could not be
made without it; that England, therefore, if the exportation of it could be
totally prevented, could monopolize to herself almost the whole woollen
tradeoftheworld;andthus,havingnorivals,couldsellatwhatpriceshe
pleased, and in a short time acquire the most incredible degree of wealth
bythemostadvantageousbalanceoftrade. Thisdoctrine,likemostother
doctrines which are confidently asserted by any considerable number of
people, was, and still continues to be, most implicitly believed by a much
greaternumber-byalmostallthosewhoareeitherunacquaintedwiththe

1425 [25] It has been shown in the foregoing part of this work that the effect of
these regulations has been to depress the price of English wool, not only
below what it naturally would be in the present times, but very much be-
lowwhatitactuallywasinthetimeofEdwardIII.ThepriceofScotswool, G.ed.p652
when in consequence of the union it became subject to the same regula-
tions,issaidtohavefallenaboutonehalf. Itisobservedbytheveryaccur-
ateandintelligentauthoroftheMemoirsofWool, theReverendMr.John
Smith, that the price of the best English wool in England is generally be-
low what wool of a very inferior quality commonly sells for in the market
ofAmsterdam. Todepressthepriceofthiscommoditybelowwhatmaybe
called its natural and proper price was the avowed purpose of those regu-
lations;andthereseemstobenodoubtoftheirhavingproducedtheeffect

producecannothavebeenmuch,thoughitmayperhapshavebeenalittle,
affectedbytheseregulations. Thegrowingofwoolisnotthechiefpurpose
forwhichthesheepfarmeremployshisindustryandstock. Heexpectshis
profit not so much from the price of the fleece as from that of the carcass;
and the average or ordinary price of the latter must even, in many cases,
makeuptohimwhateverdeficiencytheremaybeintheaverageorordin-
ary price of the former. It has been observed in the foregoing part of this
work that, ‘Whatever regulations tend to sink the price, either of wool or
505 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ofrawhides, belowwhatitnaturallywouldbe, must, inanimprovedand

of this price, therefore, is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid
by the carcass. The less there is paid for the one, the more must be paid
fortheother. Inwhatmannerthispriceistobedivideduponthedifferent
parts of the beast is indifferent to the landlords and farmers, provided it
isallpaidtothem. Inanimprovedandcultivatedcountry,therefore,their
interest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such regu- G.ed.p653
lations, though their interest as consumers may by the rise in the price
of provisions.’ According to this reasoning, therefore, this degradation in
the price of wool is not likely, in an improved and cultivated country, to
occasion any diminution in the annual produce of that commodity, except
so far as, by raising the price of mutton, it may somewhat diminish the
demandfor, andconsequentlytheproductionof, thatparticularspeciesof
butcher’s meat. Its effect, however, even in this way, it is probable, is not
veryconsiderable.
1427 [27] Butthoughitseffectuponthequantityoftheannualproducemaynot
havebeenveryconsiderable,itseffectuponthequality,itmayperhapsbe
thought, must necessarily have been very great. The degradation in the
qualityofEnglishwool,ifnotbelowwhatitwasinformertimes,yetbelow
what it naturally would have been in the present state of improvement
andcultivation,musthavebeen,itmayperhapsbesupposed,verynearly
inproportiontothedegradationofprice. Asthequalitydependsuponthe

tothesecircumstances,itmaynaturallyenoughbeimagined,canneverbe
greaterthaninproportiontotherecompensewhichthepriceofthefleece
islikelytomakeforthelabourandexpensewhichthatattentionrequires.
It happens, however, that the goodness of the fleece depends, in a great
measure, upon the health, growth, and bulk of the animal; the same at-
tention which is necessary for the improvement of the carcase is, in some
respects,sufficientforthatofthefleece. Notwithstandingthedegradation
of price, English wool is said to have been improved considerably during
the course even of the present century. The improvement might perhaps
have been greater if the price had been better; but the lowness of price,
thoughitmayhaveobstructed,yetcertainlyithasnotaltogetherpreven-
tedthatimprovement.
1428 [28] The violence of these regulations, therefore, seems to have affected
neitherthequantitynorthequalityoftheannualproduceofwoolsomuch
as it might have been expected to do (though I think it probable that it
may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former); and the
506 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
interestofthegrowersofwool,thoughitmusthavebeenhurtinsomede-
gree, seems, upon the whole, to have been much less hurt than could well
havebeenimagined.
1429 [29] Theseconsiderations,however,willnotjustifytheabsoluteprohibition
of the exportation of wool. But they will fully justify the imposition of a
considerabletaxuponthatexportation.
1430 [30] To hurt in any degree the interest of any one order of citizens, for no G.ed.p654
other purpose but to promote that of some other, is evidently contrary to
that justice and equality of treatment which the sovereign owes to all the
different orders of his subjects. But the prohibition certainly hurts, in
some degree, the interest of the growers of wool, for no other purpose but
topromotethatofthemanufacturers.
1431 [31] Every different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support
of the sovereign or commonwealth. A tax of five, or even of ten shillings
upon the exportation of every ton of wool would produce a very consider-
able revenue to the sovereign. It would hurt the interest of the growers
somewhat less than the prohibition, because it would not probably lower
the price of wool quite so much. It would afford a sufficient advantage to
the manufacturer, because, though he might not buy his wool altogether
so cheap as under the prohibition, he would still buy it, at least, five or
ten shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it, besides
savingthefreightandinsurance,whichtheotherwouldbeobligedtopay.
It is scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce any considerable
revenuetothesovereign,andatthesametimeoccasionsolittleinconveni-
encytoanybody.
1432 [32] Theprohibition,notwithstandingallthepenaltieswhichguardit,does
not prevent the exportation of wool. It is exported, it is well known, in
great quantities. The great difference between the price in the home and
that in the foreign market presents such a temptation to smuggling that
all the rigour of the law cannot prevent it. This illegal exportation is ad-
vantageous to nobody but the smuggler. A legal exportation subject to a
tax, by affording a revenue to the sovereign, and thereby saving the im-
positionofsomeother,perhaps,moreburdensomeandinconvenienttaxes
mightproveadvantageoustoallthedifferentsubjectsofthestate.
1433 [33] The exportation of fuller’s earth or fuller’s clay, supposed to be ne-
cessary for preparing and cleansing the woolen manufactures, has been
subjected to nearly the same penalties as the exportation of wool. Even
tobacco-pipe clay, though acknowledged to be different from fuller’s clay,
yet,onaccountoftheirresemblance,andbecausefuller’sclaymightsome-
times be exported as tobacco-pipe clay, has been laid under the same pro-
hibitionsandpenalties.
1434 [34] By the 13th and 14th of Charles II. chap. 7, the exportation, not only
of raw hides, but of tanned leather, except in the shape of boots, shoes, or
slippers, was prohibited; and the law gave a monopoly to our bootmakers G.ed.p655
and shoemakers, not only against our graziers, but against our tanners.
507 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
By subsequent statutes our tanners have got themselves exempted from
thismonopolyuponpayingasmalltaxofonlyoneshillingonthehundred-
weightoftannedleather,weighingonehundredandtwelvepounds. They
haveobtainedlikewisethedrawbackoftwo-thirdsoftheexcisedutiesim-
posed upon their commodity even when exported without further manu-
facture. All manufactures of leather may be exported duty free; and the
exporter is besides entitled to the drawback of the whole duties of excise.
Our graziers still continue subject to the old monopoly. Graziers separ-
ated from one another, and dispersed through all the different corners of
thecountry,cannot,withoutgreatdifficulty,combinetogetherforthepur-
poseeitherofimposingmonopoliesupontheirfellowcitizens,orofexempt-

people. Manufacturers of all kinds, collected together in numerous bodies
inallgreatcities,easilycan. Eventhehornsofcattleareprohibitedtobe
exported; and the two insignificant trades of the horner and combmaker
enjoy,inthisrespect,amonopolyagainstthegraziers.
1435 [35] Restraints, either by prohibitions or by taxes, upon the exportation of
goods which are partially, but not completely manufactured, are not pe-
culiar to the manufacture of leather. As long as anything remains to be
done, in order to fit any commodity for immediate use and consumption,
our manufacturers think that they themselves ought to have the doing of
it. Woolenyarnandworstedareprohibitedtobeexportedunderthesame
penalties as wool. Even white cloths are subject to a duty upon exporta-
tion,andourdyershavesofarobtainedamonopolyagainstourclothiers.
Ourclothierswouldprobablyhavebeenabletodefendthemselvesagainst
it,butithappensthatthegreaterpartofourprincipalclothiersarethem-
selves likewise dyers. Watch-cases, clockcases, and dial-plates for clocks
and watches have been prohibited to be exported. Our clock-makers and G.ed.p656
watch-makers are, it seems, unwilling that the price of this sort of work-
manshipshouldberaiseduponthembythecompetitionofforeigners.
1436 [36] By some old statutes of Edward III, Henry VIII, and Edward VI, the
exportationofallmetalswasprohibited. Leadandtinwerealoneexcepted
probablyonaccountofthegreatabundanceofthosemetals,intheexport-
ation of which a considerable part of the trade of the kingdom in those
daysconsisted. Fortheencouragementoftheminingtrade,the5thofWil-

508 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

wool cards, white woolen cloths, lapis calaminaris, skins of all sorts, glue,
coney hair or wool, hares’ wool, hair of all sorts, horses, and litharge of
lead. If you expect horses, all these are either materials of manufacture,
orincompletemanufactures(whichmaybeconsideredasmaterialsforstill

subject to all the old duties which had ever been imposed upon them, the
oldsubsidyandonepercentoutwards.
1439 [39] Bythesamestatuteagreatnumberofforeigndrugsfordyers’useare
exempted from all duties upon importation. Each of them, however, is af-
terwards subjected to a certain duty, not indeed a very heavy one, upon
exportation. Ourdyers,itseems,whiletheythoughtitfortheirinterestto G.ed.p657
encouragetheimportationofthosedrugs,byanexemptionfromallduties,
thought it likewise for their interest to throw some small discouragement
upon their exportation. The avidity, however, which suggested this not-
ablepieceofmercantileingenuity,mostprobablydisappointeditselfofits
object. It necessarily taught the importers to be more careful than they
mightotherwisehavebeenthattheirimportationshouldnotexceedwhat
was necessary for the supply of the home market. The home market was
atalltimeslikelytobemorescantilysupplied;thecommoditieswereatall
times likely to be somewhat dearer there than they would have been had
theexportationbeenrenderedasfreeastheimportation.
1440 [40] By the above-mentioned statute, gum senega, or gum arabic, being
among the enumerated dyeing drugs, might be imported duty free. They
weresubjected,indeed,toasmallpoundageduty,amountingonlytothree-
pence in the hundredweight upon their re-exportation. France enjoyed,
at that time, an exclusive trade to the country most productive of those
drugs, that which lies in the neighbourhood of the Senegal; and the Brit-
ish market could not easily be supplied by the immediate importation of
them from the place of growth. By the 25th George II, therefore, gum
senega was allowed to be imported (contrary to the general dispositions
of the Act of Navigation) from any part of Europe. As the law, however,
did not mean to encourage this species of trade, so contrary to the gen-
eral principles of the mercantile policy of England, it imposed a duty of
ten shillings the hundredweight upon such importation, and no part of
thisduty wasto beafterwards drawnbackupon itsexportation. Thesuc-
cessful war which began in 1755 gave Great Britain the same exclusive
trade to those countries which France had enjoyed before. Our manufac-
turers, as soon as the peace was made, endeavoured to avail themselves
of this advantage, and to establish a monopoly in their own favour both
against the growers and against the importers of this commodity. By the
5th Geo. III, therefore, chap. 37, the exportation of gum senega from his
Majesty’sdominionsinAfricawasconfinedtoGreatBritain,andwassub-
jected to all the same restrictions, regulations, forfeitures, and penalties
509 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
as that of the enumerated commodities of the British colonies in America
andtheWestIndies. Itsimportation,indeed,wassubjectedtoasmallduty
ofsixpencethehundredweight,butitsre-exportationwassubjectedtothe
enormous duty of one pound ten shillings the hundredweight. It was the
intention of our manufacturers that the whole produce of those countries
shouldbeimportedintoGreatBritain,and,inorderthattheythemselves G.ed.p658
mightbeenabledtobuyitattheirownprice,thatnopartofitshouldbeex-
portedagainbutatsuchanexpenseaswouldsufficientlydiscouragethat
exportation. Theiravidity,however,uponthis,aswellasuponmanyother
occasions, disappointed itself of its object. This enormous duty presented
such a temptation to smuggling that great quantities of this commodity
were clandestinely exported, probably to all the manufacturing countries
of Europe, put particularly to Holland, not only from Great Britain but
from Africa. Upon this account, by the 14th Geo. III. chap. 10, this duty
uponexportationwasreducedtofiveshillingsthehundredweight.
[41] In the book of rates, according to which the Old Subsidy was levied,
1441
beaver skins were estimated at six shillings and eightpence a piece, and
the different subsidies and imposts, which before the year 1722 had been
laid upon their importation, amounted to one-fifth part of the rate, or to
sixteenpence upon each skin; all of which, except half the Old Subsidy,
amountingonlytotwopence,wasdrawnbackuponexportation. Thisduty
upontheimportationofsoimportantamaterialofmanufacturehadbeen
thought too high, and in the year 1722 the rate was reduced to two shil-
lings and sixpence, which reduced the duty upon importation to sixpence,
and of this only one half was to be drawn back upon exportation. The
same successful war put the country most productive of beaver under the
dominionofGreatBritain,andbeaverskinsbeingamongtheenumerated
commodities, their exportation from America was consequently confined
tothemarketofGreatBritain. Ourmanufacturerssoonbethoughtthem-
selves of the advantage which they might make of this circumstance, and
intheyear1764thedutyupontheimportationofbeaver-skinwasreduced
toonepenny,butthedutyuponexportationwasraisedtosevenpenceeach
skin, without any drawback of the duty upon importation. By the same
law,adutyofeighteenpencethepoundwasimposedupontheexportation
of beaverwool or wombs, without making any alteration in the duty upon
the importation of that commodity, which, when imported by Britain and
inBritishshipping,amountedatthattimetobetweenfourpenceandfive-
pencethepiece.
[42] Coals may be considered both as a material of manufacture and as an
1442
instrument of trade. Heavy duties, accordingly, have been imposed upon
theirexportation,amountingatpresent(1783)tomorethanfiveshillings

ures;whichisinmostcasesmorethantheoriginalvalueofthecommodity G.ed.p659

1443 [43] The exportation, however, of the instruments of trade, properly so
510 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
called, is commonly restrained, not by high duties, but by absolute pro-
hibitions. Thus by the 7th and 8th of William III. chap. 20, sect. 8, the
exportationofframesorenginesforknittingglovesorstockingsisprohib-
itedunderthepenalty,notonlyoftheforfeitureofsuchframesorengines
so exported, or attempted to be exported, but of forty pounds, one half to
the king, the other to the person who shall inform or sue for the same. In
thesamemanner,bythe14thGeo.III.chap.71,theexportationtoforeign
parts of any utensils made use of in the cotton, linen, woollen, and silk
manufacturesisprohibitedunderthepenalty, notonlyoftheforfeitureof
such utensils, but of two hundred pounds, to be paid by the person who
shalloffendinthismanner,andlikewiseoftwohundredpoundstobepaid
by the master of the ship who shall knowingly suffer such utensils to be
loadedonboardhisship.
[44] When such heavy penalties were imposed upon the exportation of the
1444
dead instruments of trade, it could not well be expected that the living
instrument, theartificer, should beallowedtogofree. Accordingly, bythe
5th Geo. I. chap. 27, the person who shall be convicted of enticing any
artificer of, or in any of the manufactures of Great Britain, to go into any
foreign parts in order to practise or teach his trade, is liable for the first
offence to be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred pounds, and to
three months’ imprisonment, and until the fine shall be paid; and for the
second offence, to be fined in any sum at the discretion of the court, and
to imprisonment for twelve months, and until the fine shall be paid. By
the 23rd Geo. II. chap. 13, this penalty is increased for the first offence to
five hundred pounds for every artificer so enticed, and to twelve months’
imprisonment,anduntilthefineshallbepaid;andforthesecondoffence,
to one thousand pounds, and to two years’ imprisonment, and until the
fineshallbepaid.
1445 [45] By the former of those two statutes, upon proof that any person has
been enticing any artificer, or that any artificer has promised or contrac-
ted to go into foreign parts for the purposes aforesaid, such artificer may
be obliged to give security at the discretion of the court that he shall not
go beyond the seas, and may be committed to prison until he give such
security.
1446 [46] If any artificer has gone beyond the seas, and is exercising or teach- G.ed.p660
ing his trade in any foreign country, upon warning being given to him by
anyofhisMajesty’sministersorconsulsabroad,orbyoneofhisMajesty’s

aftersuchwarning,returnintothisrealm,andfromthenceforthabideand

allhislands,goods,andchattels,isdeclaredanalienineveryrespect,and
isputoutoftheking’sprotection.
511 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1447 [47] It is unnecessary, I imagine, to observe how contrary such regulations
are to the boasted liberty of the subject, of which we affect to be so very
jealous;butwhich,inthiscase,issoplainlysacrificedtothefutileinterests
ofourmerchantsandmanufacturers.
1448 [48] Thelaudablemotiveofalltheseregulationsistoextendourownman-
ufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of those
of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible, to the
troublesomecompetitionofsuchodiousanddisagreeablerivals. Ourmas-
ter manufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have
themonopolyoftheingenuityofalltheircountrymen. Thoughbyrestrain-
ing, in some trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at
one time, and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all
trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their re-
spectiveemploymentstoassmallanumberaspossible;theyareunwilling,
however, that any part of this small number should go abroad to instruct
foreigners.
1449 [49] Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the
interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be
necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly
self evident that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it. But in the
mercantilesystemtheinterestoftheconsumerisalmostconstantlysacri-
ficed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider production, and not
consumption,astheultimateendandobjectofallindustryandcommerce.
1450 [50] Intherestraintsupontheimportationofallforeigncommoditieswhich
can come into competition with those of our own growth or manufacture,
the interest of the home consumer is evidently sacrificed to that of the
producer. Itisaltogetherforthebenefitofthelatterthattheformerisob-
ligedtopaythatenhancementofpricewhichthismonopolyalmostalways
occasions.
1451 [51] Itisaltogetherforthebenefitoftheproducerthatbountiesaregranted G.ed.p661
upon the exportation of some of his productions. The home consumer is
obligedto pay, first, the taxwhich isnecessary forpayingthe bounty, and
secondly, the still greater tax which necessarily arises from the enhance-
mentofthepriceofthecommodityinthehomemarket.
1452 [52] By the famous treaty of commerce with Portugal, the consumer is pre-
vented by high duties from purchasing of a neighbouring country a com-
moditywhichourownclimatedoesnotproduce,butisobligedtopurchase
it of a distant country, though it is acknowledged that the commodity of
the distant country is of a worse quality than that of the near one. The
homeconsumerisobligedtosubmittothisinconveniencyinorderthatthe

do. Theconsumer,too,isobligedtopaywhateverenhancementintheprice

512 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1453 [53] But in the system of laws which has been established for the manage-
ment of our American and West Indian colonies, the interest of the home
consumerhasbeensacrificedtothatoftheproducerwithamoreextravag-
antprofusionthaninallourothercommercialregulations. Agreatempire

little enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our produ-
cers, the home consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of
maintaininganddefendingthatempire. Forthispurpose,andforthispur-
poseonly,inthetwolastwars,morethantwohundredmillionshavebeen

been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class our merchants
and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects. In the mer- G.ed.p662

interest of our manufacturers has been most peculiarly attended to; and
the interest, not so much of the consumers, as that of some other sets of

be worth while to examine at great length the errors of a system which
never has done, and probably never will do, any harm in any part of the
world. I shall endeavour to explain, however, as distinctly as I can, the
greatoutlinesofthisveryingenioussystem.
1457 [3] Mr. Colbert, the famous minister of Louis XIV, was a man of probity,
of great industry and knowledge of detail, of great experience and acute-
nessintheexaminationofpublicaccounts,andofabilities,inshort,every
way fitted for introducing method and good order into the collection and
expenditure of the public revenue. That minister had unfortunately em-
braced all the prejudices of the mercantile system, in its nature and es-
senceasystemofrestraintandregulation,andsuchascouldscarcefailto
be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of business, who had been
accustomed to regulate the different departments of public offices, and to
establishthenecessarychecksandcontrolsforconfiningeachtoitsproper G.ed.p664
sphere. The industry and commerce of a great country he endeavoured to
regulate upon the same model as the departments of a public office; and
instead of allowing every man to pursue his own interest in his own way,
upon the liberal plan of equality, liberty, and justice, he bestowed upon
certainbranchesofindustryextraordinaryprivileges,whilehelaidothers
under as extraordinary restraints. He was not only disposed, like other TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
European ministers, to encourage more the industry of the towns than
that of the country; but, in order to support the industry of the towns, he
was willing even to depress and keep down that of the country. In order
torenderprovisionscheaptotheinhabitantsofthetowns,andtherebyto
encourage manufactures and foreign commerce, he prohibited altogether
the exportation of corn, and thus excluded the inhabitants of the country
from every foreign market for by far the most important part of the pro-
duce of their industry. This prohibition, joined to the restraints imposed
by the ancient provincial laws of France upon the transportation of corn
from one province to another, and to the arbitrary and degrading taxes
which are levied upon the cultivators in almost all the provinces, discour-
aged and kept down the agriculture of that country very much below the
state to which it would naturally have risen in so very fertile a soil and
soveryhappyaclimate. Thisstateofdiscouragementanddepressionwas
feltmoreorlessineverydifferentpartofthecountry,andmanydifferent
inquiriesweresetonfootconcerningthecausesofit. Oneofthosecauses
appeared to be the preference given, by the institutions of Mr. Colbert, to
theindustryofthetownsabovethatofthecountry.
1458 [4] Iftherodbebenttoomuchoneway,saystheproverb,inordertomake
it straight you must bend it as much the other. The French philosophers,
who have proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole
source of the revenue and wealth of every country, seem to have adopted
thisproverbialmaxim;andasintheplanofMr.Colberttheindustryofthe
townswascertainlyovervaluedincomparisonwiththatofthecountry;so
intheirsystemitseemstobeascertainlyundervalued.
1459 [5] Thedifferentordersofpeoplewhohaveeverbeensupposedtocontrib-
ute in any respect towards the annual produce of the land and labour of
thecountry,theydivideintothreeclasses. Thefirstistheclassofthepro-
prietors of land. The second is the class of the cultivators, of farmers and
countrylabourers, whomtheyhonourwiththepeculiarappellationofthe
productive class. The third is the class of artificers, manufacturers, and
merchants, whom they endeavour to degrade by the humiliating appella-
tionofthebarrenorunproductiveclass.
1460 [6] The class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce by the ex- G.ed.p665
pense which they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the
land, upon the buildings, drains, enclosures, and other ameliorations,
which they may either make or maintain upon it, and by means of which
the cultivators are enabled, with the same capital, to raise a greater pro-
duce, and consequently to pay a greater rent. This advanced rent may be
consideredastheinterestorprofitduetotheproprietorupontheexpense
or capital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land. Such
expensesareinthissystemcalledgroundexpenses(depensesfoncieres.)
1461 [7] Thecultivatorsorfarmerscontributetotheannualproducebywhatare
in this system called the original and annual expenses (depenses primit-
ives et depenses annuelles) which they lay out upon the cultivation of the
515 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
land. The original expenses consist in the instruments of husbandry, in
the stock of cattle, in the seed, and in the maintenance of the farmer’s
family, servants, andcattleduringatleastagreatpartofthefirstyearof
his occupancy, or till he can receive some return from the land. The an-
nualexpensesconsistintheseed,inthewearandtearoftheinstruments
ofhusbandry,andintheannualmaintenanceofthefarmer’sservantsand
cattle, and of his family too, so far as any part of them can be considered
as servants employed in cultivation. That part of the produce of the land
which remains to him after paying the rent ought to be sufficient, first,
to replace to him within a reasonable time, at least during the term of
hisoccupancy,thewholeofhisoriginalexpenses,togetherwiththeordin-
aryprofits ofstock; and, secondly, toreplace tohimannually thewholeof
his annual expenses, together likewise with the ordering profits of stock.
Thosetwosortsofexpensesaretwocapitalswhichthefarmeremploysin

a reasonable profit, he cannot carry on his employment upon a level with
other employments; but, from a regard to his own interest, must desert it
as soon as possible and seek some other. That part of the produce of the
landwhichisthusnecessaryforenablingthefarmertocontinuehisbusi-
ness ought to be considered as a fund sacred to cultivation, which, if the
landlordviolates, henecessarilyreducestheproduceofhisownland, and
in a few years not only disables the farmer from paying this racked rent,

Theiroriginalandannualexpensesareforthesamereasoncalled,inthis
system,productiveexpenses,because,overandabovereplacingtheirown

1462 [8] Thegroundexpenses, astheyarecalled, orwhatthelandlordlaysout
upon the improvement of his land, are in this system, too, honoured with
the appellation of productive expenses. Till the whole of those expenses,
togetherwiththeordinaryprofitsofstock,havebeencompletelyrepaidto
himbytheadvancedrentwhichhegetsfromhisland,thatadvancedrent
ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable, both by the church and by
the king; ought to be subject neither to tithe nor to taxation. If it is oth-
erwise, by discouraging the improvement of land the church discourages
the future increase of her own tithes, and the king the future increase of
hisowntaxes. Asinawell-orderedstateofthings,therefore,thoseground

duce,theyareinthissystemconsideredasproductiveexpenses.
1463 [9] The ground expenses of the landlord, however, together with the ori-
ginal and the annual expenses of the farmer, are the only three sorts of
expenses which in this system are considered as productive. All other ex-
pensesandallotherordersofpeople,eventhosewhointhecommonappre-
hensions of men are regarded as the most productive, are in this account
ofthingsrepresentedasaltogetherbarrenandunproductive.
1464 [10] Artificersandmanufacturersinparticular,whoseindustry,inthecom-
mon apprehensions of men, increases so much the value of the rude pro-
duceofland,areinthissystemrepresentedasaclassofpeoplealtogether

inthematerials,tools,andwagesadvancedtothembytheiremployer;and

the fund destined for the maintenance of their employer. Their employer,
asheadvancestothemthestockofmaterials, tools, andwagesnecessary

does not. The expense, therefore, laid out in employing and maintaining
artificers and manufacturers does no more than continue, if one may say
so, the existence of its own value, and does not produce any new value. It
is therefore altogether a barren and unproductive expense. The expense,

valueofthewholeannualamountoftherudeproduceoftheland. Itadds,
indeed, greatly to the value of some particular parts of it. But the con-
sumption which in the meantime it occasions of other parts is precisely
517 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
equal to the value which it adds to those parts; so that the value of the
whole amount is not, at any one moment of time, in the least augmented
by it. The person who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles, for example,
will sometimes raise the value of perhaps a pennyworth of flax to thirty
pounds sterling. But though at first sight he appears thereby to multiply
thevalueofapartoftherudeproduceaboutseventhousandandtwohun-
dred times, he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole annual
amount of the rude produce. The working of that lace costs him perhaps
two years’ labour. The thirty pounds which he gets for it when it is fin-
ishedisnomorethantherepaymentofthesubsistencewhichheadvances
to himself during the two years that he is employed about it. The value
which, by every day’s, month’s, or year’s labour, he adds to the flax does
no more than replace the value of his own consumption during that day,
month, or year. At no moment of time, therefore, does he add anything to
thevalueofthewholeannualamountoftherudeproduceoftheland: the
portion of that produce which he is continually consuming being always
equaltothevaluewhichheiscontinuallyproducing. Theextremepoverty G.ed.p668
of the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive though tri-
fling manufacture may satisfy us that the price of their work does not in
ordinary cases exceed the value of their subsistence. It is otherwise with
the work of farmers and country labourers. The rent of the landlord is a
valuewhich,inordinarycases,itiscontinuallyproducing,overandabove

1467 [13] Artificers, manufacturers, and merchants can augment the revenue
and wealth of their society by parsimony only; or, as it in this system, by
privation, that is, by depriving themselves a part of the funds destined
for their own subsistence. They annually reproduce nothing but those
funds. Unless, therefore, they annually save some part of them, unless
they annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of them,
the revenue and wealth of their society can never be in the smallest de-
gree augmented by means of their industry. Farmers and country labour-
ers, on the contrary, may enjoy completely the whole funds destined for
theirownsubsistence,andyetaugmentatthesametimetherevenueand
wealth of their society. Over and above what is destined for their own
subsistence, their industry annually affords a net produce, of which the
augmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their soci-
ety. Nations therefore which, like France or England, consist in a great
measure of proprietors and cultivators can be enriched by industry and
enjoyment. Nations, on the contrary, which, like Holland and Hamburg,
arecomposedchieflyofmerchants,artificers,andmanufacturerscangrow
rich only through parsimony and privation. As the interest of nations so
differentlycircumstancedisverydifferent,soislikewisethecommonchar-
acter of the people: in those of the former kind, liberality, frankness and
518 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
good fellowship naturally make a part of that common character: in the
latter,narrowness,meanness,andaselfishdisposition,aversetoallsocial
pleasureandenjoyment.
1468 [14] The unproductive class, that of merchants, artificers, and manufactur-
ers,ismaintainedandemployedaltogetherattheexpenseofthetwoother
classes, of that of proprietors, and of that of cultivators. They furnish it
both with the materials of its work and with the fund of its subsistence,
withthecornandcattlewhichitconsumeswhileitisemployedaboutthat
work. Theproprietorsandcultivatorsfinallypayboththewagesofallthe
workmenoftheunproductiveclass,andoftheprofitsofalltheiremployers.
Those workmen and their employers are properly the servants of the pro-
prietors and cultivators. They are only servants who work without doors,
asmenialservantsworkwithin. Boththeoneandtheother,however,are G.ed.p669
equallymaintainedattheexpenseofthesamemasters. Thelabourofboth
is equally unproductive. It adds nothing to the value of the sum total of
the rude produce of the land. Instead of increasing the value of that sum
total,itisachargeandexpensewhichmustbepaidoutofit.
1469 [15] The unproductive class, however, is not only useful, but greatly useful
to the other two classes. By means of the industry of merchants, arti-
ficers, and manufacturers, the proprietors and cultivators can purchase
boththeforeigngoodsandthemanufacturedproduceoftheirowncountry
which they have occasion for with the produce of a much smaller quant-
ity of their own labour than what they would be obliged to employ if they
were to attempt, in an awkward and unskilful manner, either to import
the one or to make the other for their own use. By means of the unpro-
ductive class, the cultivators are delivered from many cares which would
otherwisedistracttheirattentionfromthecultivationofland. Thesuperi-
ority of produce, which, in consequence of this undivided attention, they
are enabled to raise, is fully sufficient to pay the whole expense which
the maintenance and employment of the unproductive class costs either
the proprietors or themselves. The industry of merchants, artificers, and
manufacturers,thoughinitsownnaturealtogetherunproductive,yetcon-
tributes in this manner indirectly to increase the produce of the land. It
increasestheproductivepowersofproductivelabourbyleavingitatliberty
to confine itself to its proper employment, the cultivation of land; and the
ploughgoesfrequentlytheeasierandthebetterbymeansofthelabourof
themanwhosebusinessismostremotefromtheplough.
1470 [16] Itcanneverbetheinterestoftheproprietorsandcultivatorstorestrain
or to discourage in any respect the industry of merchants, artificers, and
manufacturers. The greater the liberty which this unproductive class en-
joys, the greater will be the competition in all the different trades which
compose it, and the cheaper will the other two classes be supplied, both
withforeigngoodsandwiththemanufacturedproduceoftheirowncoun-
try.
1471 [17] It can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the
519 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
other two classes. It is the surplus produce of the land, or what remains
afterdeductingthemaintenance,first,ofthecultivators,andafterwardsof
the proprietors, that maintains and employs the unproductive class. The
greater this surplus the greater must likewise be the maintenance and
employment of that class. The establishment of perfect justice, of perfect
liberty, and of perfect equality is the very simple secret which most effec-
tuallysecuresthehighestdegreeofprosperitytoallthethreeclasses.
1472 [18] The merchants, artificers, and manufacturers of those mercantile G.ed.p670
stateswhich,likeHollandandHamburg,consistchieflyofthisunproduct-
iveclass,areinthesamemannermaintainedandemployedaltogetherat
theexpenseoftheproprietorsandcultivatorsofland. Theonlydifference
is, that those proprietors and cultivators are, the greater part of them,
placedatamostinconvenientdistancefromthemerchants,artificers,and
manufacturers whom they supply with the materials of their work and
the fund of their subsistences- the inhabitants of other countries and the
subjectsofothergovernments.
1473 [19] Suchmercantilestates,however,arenotonlyuseful,butgreatlyuseful
totheinhabitantsofthoseothercountries. Theyfillup,insomemeasure,
a very important void, and supply the place of the merchants, artificers,
andmanufacturerswhomtheinhabitantsofthosecountriesoughttofind
at home, but whom, from some defect in their policy, they do not find at
home.
1474 [20] It can never be the interest of those landed nations, if I may call them
so, to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states by im-
posing high duties upon their trade or upon the commodities which they
furnish. Such duties, by rendering those commodities dearer, could serve
only to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own land, with
which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which those
commodities are purchased. Such duties could serve only to discourage
the increase of that surplus produce, and consequently the improvement
and cultivation of their own land. The most effectual expedient, on the
contrary,forraisingthevalueofthatsurplusproduce,forencouragingits
increase, and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own
land would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all such
mercantilenations.
1475 [21] This perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual expedi-
ent for supplying them, in due time, with all the artificers, manufactur-
ers, and merchants whom they wanted at home, and for filling up in the
properestandmostadvantageousmannerthatveryimportantvoidwhich
theyfeltthere.
1476 [22] The continual increase of the surplus produce of their land would, in
due time, create a greater capital than what could be employed with the
ordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land; and
the surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment of
artificers and manufacturers at home. But those artificers and manufac-
520 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
turers, finding at home both the materials of their work and the fund of
theirsubsistence,mightimmediatelyevenwithmuchlessartandskillbe
abletoworkascheapasthelikeartificersandmanufacturersofsuchmer-
cantile states who had both to bring from a great distance. Even though,
from want of art and skill, they might not for some time be able to work G.ed.p671
as cheap, yet, finding a market at home, they might be able to sell their
work there as cheap as that of the artificers and manufacturers of such
mercantile states, which could not be brought to that market but from
so great a distance; and as their art and skill improved, they would soon
be able to sell it cheaper. The artificers and manufacturers of such mer-
cantile states, therefore, would immediately be rivalled in the market of
those landed nations, and soon after undersold and jostled out of it alto-
gether. The cheapness of the manufactures of those landed nations, in
consequence of the gradual improvements of art and skill, would, in due
time, extendtheirsalebeyondthehomemarket, andcarrythemtomany
foreign markets, from which they would in the same manner gradually
jostleoutmanyofthemanufacturersofsuchmercantilenations.
1477 [23] This continual increase both of the rude and manufactured produce
of those landed nations would in due time create a greater capital than
could,withtheordinaryrateofprofit,beemployedeitherinagricultureor
inmanufactures. Thesurplusofthiscapitalwouldnaturallyturnitselfto
foreigntrade,andbeemployedinexportingtoforeigncountriessuchparts
of the rude and manufactured produce of its own country as exceeded the
demandofthehomemarket. Intheexportationoftheproduceoftheirown
country,themerchantsofalandednationwouldhaveanadvantageofthe
same kind over those of mercantile nations which its artificers and man-
ufacturers had over the artificers and manufacturers of such nations; the
advantage of finding at home that cargo and those stores and provisions
which the others were obliged to seek for at a distance. With inferior art
and skill in navigation, therefore, they would be able to sell that cargo as
cheapinforeignmarketsasthemerchantsofsuchmercantilenations;and
with equal art and skill they would be able to sell it cheaper. They would
soon, therefore, rival those mercantile nations in this branch of foreign
trade,andinduetimewouldjostlethemoutofitaltogether.
1478 [24] According to this liberal and generous system, therefore, the most ad-
vantageousmethodinwhichalandednationcanraiseupartificers,manu-
facturers,andmerchantsofitsownistograntthemostperfectfreedomof

cessarilyraisesupalltheartificers,manufacturers,andmerchantswhom

1479 [25] When a landed nation, on the contrary, oppresses either by high du-
tiesorbyprohibitionsthetradeofforeignnations, itnecessarilyhurtsits
owninterestintwodifferentways. First,byraisingthepriceofallforeign
521 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
goods and of all sorts of manufactures, it necessarily sinks the real value
of the surplus produce of its own land, with which, or, what comes to the G.ed.p672
same thing, with the price of which it purchases those foreign goods and
manufactures. Secondly, by giving a sort of monopoly of the home market
to its own merchants, artificers, and manufacturers, it raises the rate of
mercantile and manufacturing profit in proportion to that of agricultural
profit,andconsequentlyeitherdrawsfromagricultureapartofthecapital
whichhadbeforebeenemployedinit,orhindersfromgoingtoitapartof
what would otherwise have gone to it. This policy, therefore, discourages
agricultureintwodifferentways;first,bysinkingtherealvalueofitspro-
duce, and thereby lowering the rate of its profit; and, secondly, by raising
the rate of profit in all other employments. Agriculture is rendered less
advantageous,andtradeandmanufacturesmoreadvantageousthanthey
otherwisewouldbe;andeverymanistemptedbyhisowninteresttoturn,
asmuchashecan,bothhiscapitalandhisindustryfromtheformertothe

1480 [26] Though, by this oppressive policy, a landed nation should be able to
raise up artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own somewhat
soonerthanitcoulddobythefreedomoftradeamatter,however,whichis
notalittledoubtful-yetitwouldraisethemup,ifonemaysayso,prema-
turely, and before it was perfectly ripe for them. By raising up too hastily
one species of industry, it would depress another more valuable species of
industry. Byraisinguptoohastilyaspeciesofindustrywhichonlyreplaces
thestockwhichemploysit, togetherwiththeordinaryprofit, itwouldde-
pressaspeciesofindustrywhich,overandabovereplacingthatstockwith
its profit, affords likewise a net produce, a free rent to the landlord. It
would depress productive labour, by encouraging too hastily that labour
whichisaltogetherbarrenandunproductive.
1481 [27] In what manner, according to this system, the sum total of the annual
produce of the land is distributed among the three classes above men-
tioned, and in what manner the labour of the unproductive class does no
morethanreplacethevalueofitsownconsumption,withoutincreasingin
anyrespectthevalueofthatsumtotal,isrepresentedbyMr.Quesnai,the
very ingenious and profound author of this system, in some arithmetical
formularies. The first of these formularies, which by way of eminence he
peculiarlydistinguishesbythenameoftheŒconomicalTable,represents
the manner in which he supposes the distribution takes place in a state G.ed.p673
of the most perfect liberty and therefore of the highest prosperity- in a
state where the annual produce is such as to afford the greatest possible
net produce, and where each class enjoys its proper share of the whole
annual produce. Some subsequent formularies represent the manner in
whichhesupposesthisdistributionismadeindifferentstatesofrestraint
and regulation; in which either the class of proprietors or the barren and
unproductive class is more favoured than the class of cultivators, and in
which either the one or the other encroaches more or less upon the share
522 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
which ought properly to belong to this productive class. Every such en-
croachment, every violation of that natural distribution, which the most
perfectlibertywouldestablish,must,accordingtothissystem,necessarily
degrade more or less, from one year to another, the value and sum total
of the annual produce, and must necessarily occasion a gradual declen-
sion in the real wealth and revenue of the society; a declension of which
theprogressmustbequickerorslower,accordingtothedegreeofthisen-
croachment,accordingasthatnaturaldistributionwhichthemostperfect
liberty would establish is more or less violated. Those subsequent formu-
lariesrepresentthedifferentdegreesofdeclensionwhich,accordingtothis
system,correspondtothedifferentdegreesinwhichthisnaturaldistribu-
tionisviolated.
1482 [28] Some speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of
the human body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of
diet and exercise, of which every, the smallest, violation necessarily occa-
sionedsomedegreeofdiseaseordisorderproportionedtothedegreeofthe
violation. Experience, however, wouldseemtoshowthatthehumanbody G.ed.p674
frequentlypreserves, toallappearancesatleast, themostperfectstateof
healthunderavastvarietyofdifferentregimens; evenundersomewhich
are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly wholesome. But
the healthful state of the human body, it would seem, contains in itself
some unknown principle of preservation, capable either of preventing or
of correcting, in many respects, the bad effects even of a very faulty regi-
men. Mr. Quesnai, who was himself a physician, and a very speculative
physician,seemstohaveentertainedanotionofthesamekindconcerning
the political body, and to have imagined that it would thrive and prosper
only under a certain precise regimen, the exact regimen of perfect liberty
and perfect justice. He seems not to have considered that, in the political
body, the natural effort which every man is continually making to better
his own condition is a principle of preservation capable of preventing and
correcting,inmanyrespects,thebadeffectsofapoliticalœconomy,insome
degree, both partial and oppressive. Such a political œconomy, though it
nodoubtretardsmoreorless,isnotalwayscapableofstoppingaltogether
the natural progress of a nation towards wealth and prosperity, and still
less of making it go backwards. If a nation could not prosper without the
enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect justice, there is not in the world
a nation which could ever have prospered. In the political body, however,

nerasithasdoneinthenaturalbodyforremedyingthoseofhisslothand

1483 [29] The capital error of this system, however, seems to lie in its repres-
entingtheclassofartificers, manufacturers, andmerchantsasaltogether
barren and unproductive. The following observations may serve to show
theimproprietyofthisrepresentation.
523 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1484 [30] First, this class, it is acknowledged, reproduces annually the value of
its own annual consumption, and continues, at least, the existence of the
stock or capital which maintains and employs it. But upon this account
alone the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to be very
improperly applied to it. We should not call a marriage barren or unpro-
ductivethoughitproducedonlyasonandadaughter,toreplacethefather
andmother,andthoughitdidnotincreasethenumberofthehumanspe- G.ed.p675
cies, but only continued it as it was before. Farmers and country labour-
ers,indeed,overandabovethestockwhichmaintainsandemploysthem,
reproduce annually a net produce, a free rent to the landlord. As a mar-
riage which affords three children is certainly more productive than one
which affords only two; so the labour of farmers and country labourers is
certainlymoreproductivethanthatofmerchants,artificers,andmanufac-
turers. Thesuperiorproduceoftheoneclass,however,doesnotrenderthe
otherbarrenorunproductive.
1485 [31] Secondly, it seems, upon this account, altogether improper to consider
artificers, manufacturers, and merchants in the same light as menial ser-
vants. Thelabourofmenialservantsdoesnotcontinuetheexistenceofthe
fundwhichmaintainsandemploysthem. Theirmaintenanceandemploy-
ment is altogether at the expense of their masters, and the work which
they perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work consists
in services which perish generally in the very instant of their perform-
ance, and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity which
can replacethe value oftheir wages andmaintenance. The labour, on the
contrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants naturally does fix
andrealizeitselfinsomesuchvendiblecommodity. Itisuponthisaccount
that, in the chapter in which I treat of productive and unproductive la-
bour, I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and merchants among the
productivelabourers,andmenialservantsamongthebarrenorunproduct-
ive.
1486 [32] Thirdly, it seems upon every supposition improper to say that the la-
bour of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants does not increase the
real revenue of the society. Though we should suppose, for example, as
itseemstobesupposedinthissystem,thatthevalueofthedaily,monthly,
andyearlyconsumptionofthisclasswasexactlyequaltothatofitsdaily,
monthly,andyearlyproduction,yetitwouldnotfromthencefollowthatits
labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the real value of the annual
produce of the land and labour of the society. An artificer, for example,
who, in the first six months after harvest, executes ten pounds’ worth of
work, though he should in the same time consume ten pounds’ worth of
corn and other necessaries, yet really adds the value of ten pounds to the
annual produce of the land and labour of the society. While he has been
consumingahalf-yearlyrevenueoftenpounds’worthofcornandotherne-
cessaries, he has produced an equal value of work capable of purchasing,
either to himself or some other person, an equal half-yearly revenue. The
524 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
value,therefore,ofwhathasbeenconsumedandproducedduringthesesix G.ed.p676
months is equal, not to ten, but to twenty pounds. It is possible, indeed,
that no more than ten pounds’ worth of this value may ever have existed
atanyonemomentoftime. Butifthetenpounds’worthofcornandother
necessaties,whichwereconsumedbytheartificer,hadbeenconsumedbya
soldierorbyamenialservant,thevalueofthatpartoftheannualproduce
which existed at the end of the six months would have been ten pounds
lessthanitactuallyisinconsequenceofthelabouroftheartificer. Though
the value of what the artificer produces, therefore, should not at any one
moment of time be supposed greater than the value he consumes, yet at
everymomentoftimetheactuallyexistingvalueofgoodsinthemarketis,
inconsequenceofwhatheproduces,greaterthanitotherwisewouldbe.
1487 [33] When the patrons of this system assert that the consumption of arti-
ficers, manufacturers, and merchants is equal to the value of what they
produce,theyprobablymeannomorethanthattheirrevenue,orthefund
destined for their consumption, is equal to it. But if they had expressed
themselves more accurately, and only asserted that the revenue of this
class was equal to the value of what they produced, it might readily have
occurredtothereaderthatwhatwouldnaturallybesavedoutofthisrev-
enuemustnecessarilyincreasemoreorlesstherealwealthofthesociety.
In order, therefore, to make out something like an argument, it was ne-
cessary that they should express themselves as they have done; and this
argument, even supposing things actually were as it seems to presume
themtobe,turnsouttobeaveryinconclusiveone.
1488 [34] Fourthly,farmersandcountrylabourerscannomoreaugment,without
parsimony,therealrevenue,theannualproduceofthelandandlabourof
their society, than artificers, manufacturers, and merchants. The annual
produceofthelandandlabourofanysocietycanbeaugmentedonlyintwo
ways; either, first, by some improvement in the productive powers of the
usefullabouractuallymaintainedwithinit;or,secondly,bysomeincrease
inthequantityofthatlabour.
1489 [35] The improvement in the productive powers of useful labour depend,
first, upon the improvement in the ability of the workman; and, secondly,
upon that of the machinery with which he works. But the labour of arti-
ficers and manufacturers, as it is capable of being more subdivided, and
the labour of each workman reduced to a greater simplicity of operation
than that of farmers and country labourers, so it is likewise capable of
both these sorts of improvements in a much higher degree1. In this re-
spect,therefore,theclassofcultivatorscanhavenosortofadvantageover
thatofartificersandmanufacturers.
1490 [36] Theincreaseinthequantityofusefullabouractuallyemployedwithin G.ed.p677
anysocietymustdependaltogetherupontheincreaseofthecapitalwhich
employsit;andtheincreaseofthatcapitalagainmustbeexactlyequalto
1[Smith]SeeBookI.Chap.I.
525 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the amount of the savings from the revenue, either of the particular per-
sons who manage and direct the employment of that capital, or of some
other persons who lend it to them. If merchants, artificers, and manu-
facturers are, as this system seems to suppose, naturally more inclined
toparsimonyandsavingthanproprietorsandcultivators,theyare,sofar,
morelikelytoaugmentthequantityofusefullabouremployedwithintheir
society, andconsequentlytoincreaseitsrealrevenue, theannualproduce
ofitslandandlabour.
1491 [37] Fifthlyandlastly,thoughtherevenueoftheinhabitantsofeverycoun-
try was supposed to consist altogether, as this system seems to suppose,
inthequantityofsubsistencewhichtheirindustrycouldprocuretothem;
yet,evenuponthissupposition,therevenueofatradingandmanufactur-
ing country must, other things being equal, always be much greater than
that of one without trade or manufactures. By means of trade and manu-
factures,agreaterquantityofsubsistencecanbeannuallyimportedintoa
particularcountrythanwhatitsownlands,intheactualstateoftheircul-
tivation, could afford. The inhabitants of a town, though they frequently
possess no lands of their own, yet draw to themselves by their industry
suchaquantityoftherudeproduceofthelandsofotherpeopleassupplies
them,notonlywiththematerialsoftheirwork,butwiththefundoftheir
subsistence. Whatatownalwaysiswithregardtothecountryinitsneigh-
bourhood,oneindependentstateorcountrymayfrequentlybewithregard
to other independent states or countries. It is thus that Holland draws a
greatpartofitssubsistencefromothercountries;livecattlefromHolstein
and Jutland, and corn from almost all the different countries of Europe.
A small quantity of manufactured produce purchases a great quantity of
rude produce. A trading and manufacturing country, therefore, naturally
purchaseswithasmallpartofitsmanufacturedproduceagreatpartofthe
rude produce of other countries; while, on the contrary, a country without
trade and manufactures is generally obliged to purchase, at the expense
of a great part of its rude produce, a very small part of the manufactured
produce of other countries. The one exports what can subsist and accom-
modatebutaveryfew,andimportsthesubsistenceandaccommodationof
a great number. The other exports the accommodation and subsistence of
agreatnumber,andimportsthatofaveryfewonly. Theinhabitantsofthe
one must always enjoy a much greater quantity of subsistence than what G.ed.p678
their own lands, in the actual state of their cultivation, could afford. The
inhabitantsoftheothermustalwaysenjoyamuchsmallerquantity.

tions as consisting, not in the unconsumable riches of money, but in the

representing perfect liberty as the only effectual expedient for rendering
this annual reproduction the greatest possible, its doctrine seems to be in
every respect as just as it is generous and liberal. Its followers are very
numerous; and as men are fond of paradoxes, and of appearing to under-
stand what surpasses the comprehension of ordinary people, the paradox
whichitmaintains,concerningtheunproductivenatureofmanufacturing
labour, has not perhaps contributed a little to increase the number of its
admirers. Theyhaveforsomeyearspastmadeaprettyconsiderablesect,

only by bringing into general discussion many subjects which had never

of their representations, accordingly, that the agriculture of France has
been delivered from several of the oppressions which it before laboured
under. Thetermduringwhichsuchaleasecanbegranted,aswillbevalid

estyandsimplicity,isnotinferiortothatofanyoftheancientphilosophers
for the founders of their respective systems. ‘There have been, since the
world began,’ says a very diligent and respectable author, the Marquis de
Mirabeau, ‘three great inventions which have principally given stability
to political societies, independent of many other inventions which have
enriched and adorned them. The first is the invention of writing, which
alone gives human nature the power of transmitting, without alteration,
itslaws,itscontracts,itsannals,anditsdiscoveries. Thesecondisthein-
vention of money, which binds together all the relations between civilised

which completes them both by perfecting their object; the great discovery

527 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1493 [39] As the political œconomy of the nations of modern Europe has been
more favourable to manufactures and foreign trade, the industry of the
towns, than to agriculture, the industry of the country; so that of other
nations has followed a different plan, and has been more favourable to
agriculturethantomanufacturesandforeigntrade.
1494 [40] The policy of China favours agriculture more than all other employ-
ments. InChinatheconditionofalabourerissaidtobeasmuchsuperior

session of some little bit of land, either in property or in lease; and leases
are there said to be granted upon very moderate terms, and to be suffi-
ciently secured to the lessees. The Chinese have little respect for foreign
trade. Your beggarly commerce! was the language in which the Mandar-
ins of Pekin used to talk to Mr. de Lange, the Russian envoy, concerning
it2. ExceptwithJapan,theChinesecarryon,themselves,andintheirown
bottoms, little or no foreign trade; and it is only into one or two ports of
their kingdom that they even admit the ships of foreign nations. Foreign
trade therefore is, in China, every way confined within a much narrower
circle than that to which it would naturally extend itself, if more freedom

of the empire of China, the vast multitude of its inhabitants, the variety G.ed.p681
of climate, and consequently of productions in its different provinces, and
the easy communication by means of water carriage between the greater
part of them, render the home market of that country of so great extent

1496 [42] The policy of ancient Egypt too, and that of the Gentoo government of
Indostan, seem to have favoured agriculture more than all other employ-
ments.
1497 [43] Both in ancient Egypt and Indostan the whole body of the people was
divided into different castes or tribes, each of which was confined, from
father to son, to a particular employment or class of employments. The
son of a priest was necessarily a priest; the son of a soldier, a soldier; the
son of a labourer, a labourer; the son of a weaver, a weaver; the son of
a tailor, a tailor, etc. In both countries, the caste of the priests held the
highest rank, and that of the soldiers the next; and in both countries, the
casteofthefarmersandlabourerswassuperiortothecastesofmerchants
andmanufacturers.
1498 [44] The government of both countries was particularly attentive to the in-
terest of agriculture. The works constructed by the ancient sovereigns of
EgyptfortheproperdistributionofthewatersoftheNilewerefamousin
antiquity; and the ruined remains of some of them are still the admira-
tion of travellers. Those of the same kind which were constructed by the
ancient sovereigns of Indostan for the proper distribution of the waters of
the Ganges as well as of many other rivers, though they have been less G.ed.p682
celebrated, seem to have been equally great. Both countries, accordingly,
though subject occasionally to dearths, have been famous for their great
fertility. Though both were extremely populous, yet, in years of moder-
ate plenty, they were both able to export great quantities of grain to their
neighbours.
1499 [45] The ancient Egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea; and as
the Gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire, nor con-
sequently to dress any victuals upon the water, it in effect prohibits them
from all distant sea voyages. Both the Egyptians and Indians must have
depended almost altogether upon the navigation of other nations for the
exportationoftheirsurplusproduce;andthisdependency,asitmusthave
confined the market, so it must have discouraged the increase of this sur-
plus produce. It must have discouraged, too, the increase of the manufac-
tured produce more than that of the rude produce. Manufactures require
amuchmoreextensivemarketthanthemostimportantpartsoftherude
produce of the land. A single shoemaker will make more than three hun-
529 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
dredpairsofshoesintheyear;andhisownfamilywillnot,perhaps,wear
out six pairs. Unless therefore he has the custom of at least fifty such
families as his own, he cannot dispose of the whole produce of his own la-
bour. Themostnumerousclassofartificerswillseldom,inalargecountry,
make more than one in fifty or one in a hundred of the whole number of
families contained in it. But in such large countries as France and Eng-
land, the number of people employed in agriculture has by some authors
been computed at a half, by others at a third, and by no author that I
know of, at less than a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country. But
as the produce of the agriculture of both France and England is, the far
greaterpartofit,consumedathome,eachpersonemployedinitmust,ac-
cordingtothesecomputations, requirelittlemorethanthecustomofone,
two, or at most, of four such families as his own in order to dispose of the
wholeproduceofhisownlabour. Agriculture,therefore,cansupportitself
under the discouragement of a confined market much better than manu-
factures. In both ancient Egypt and Indostan, indeed, the confinement of
theforeignmarketwasinsomemeasurecompensatedbytheconveniency
ofmanyinlandnavigations,whichopened,inthemostadvantageousman-
ner, the whole extent of the home market to every part of the produce of
every different district of those countries. The great extent of Indostan,
too,renderedthehomemarketofthatcountryverygreat,andsufficientto
support a great variety of manufactures. But the small extent of ancient
Egypt,whichwasneverequaltoEngland,mustatalltimeshaverendered
thehomemarketofthatcountrytoonarrowforsupportinganygreatvari- G.ed.p683
ety of manufactures. Bengal, accordingly, the province of Indostan, which
commonly exports the greatest quantity of rice, has always been more re-
markable for the exportation of a great variety of manufactures than for
that of its grain. Ancient Egypt, on the contrary, though it exported some
manufactures, fine linen in particular, as well as some other goods, was
always most distinguished for its great exportation of grain. It was long
thegranaryoftheRomanempire.
1500 [46] The sovereigns of China, of ancient Egypt, and of the different king-
domsintowhichIndostanhasatdifferenttimesbeendivided,havealways
derived the whole, or by far the most considerable part, of their revenue
from some sort of land tax or land rent. This land tax or land rent, like
the tithe in Europe, consisted in a certain proportion, a fifth, it is said,
of the produce of the land, which was either delivered in kind, or paid in
money, according to a certain valuation, and which therefore varied from
year to year according to all the variations of the produce. It was natural
therefore that the sovereigns of those countries should be particularly at-
tentive to the interests of agriculture, upon the prosperity or declension
ofwhichimmediatelydependedtheyearlyincreaseordiminutionoftheir
ownrevenue.
1501 [47] ThepolicyoftheancientrepublicsofGreece,andthatofRome,though
it honoured agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade, yet
530 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
seems rather to have discouraged the latter employments than to have
givenanydirectorintentionalencouragementtotheformer. Inseveralof
the ancient states of Greece, foreign trade was prohibited altogether; and
in several others the employments of artificers and manufacturers were
considered as hurtful to the strength and agility of the human body, as
rendering it incapable of those habits which their military and gymnastic
exercisesendeavouredtoforminit,andastherebydisqualifyingitmoreor
lessforundergoingthefatiguesandencounteringthedangersofwar. Such
occupations were considered as fit only for slaves, and the free citizens of
thestatewereprohibitedfromexercisingthem. Eveninthosestateswhere G.ed.p684
no such prohibition took place, as in Rome and Athens, the great body of
thepeoplewereineffectexcludedfromallthetradeswhichare,nowcom-
monlyexercisedbythelowersortoftheinhabitantsoftowns. Suchtrades
were, at Athens and Rome, all occupied by the slaves of the rich, who ex-
ercised them for the benefit of their masters, whose wealth, power, and
protection made it almost impossible for a poor freeman to find a mar-
ket for his work, when it came into competition with that of the slaves
of the rich. Slaves, however, are very seldom inventive; and all the most
importantimprovements, eitherin machinery, or inthe arrangementand
distributionofworkwhichfacilitateandabridgelabour,havebeenthedis-
coveriesoffreemen. Shouldaslaveproposeanyimprovementofthiskind,
his master would be very apt to consider the proposal as the suggestion
of laziness, and a desire to save his own labour at the master’s expense.
Thepoorslave,insteadofreward,wouldprobablymeetwithmuchabuse,
perhapswithsomepunishment. Inthemanufacturescarriedonbyslaves,
therefore, more labour must generally have been employed to execute the
same quantity of work than in those carried on by freemen. The work of
theformermust,uponthataccount,generallyhavebeendearerthanthat
of the latter. The Hungarian mines, it is remarked by Mr. Montesquieu,
thoughnotricher,havealwaysbeenwroughtwithlessexpense,andthere-
forewithmoreprofit,thantheTurkishminesintheirneighbourhood. The
Turkish mines are wrought by slaves; and the arms of those slaves are
the only machines which the Turks have ever thought of employing. The
Hungarianminesarewroughtbyfreemen,whoemployagreatdealofma-
chinery, by which they facilitate and abridge their own labour. From the
very little that is known about the price of manufactures in the times of
the Greeks and Romans, it would appear that those of the finer sort were G.ed.p685
excessively dear. Silk sold for its weight in gold. It was not, indeed, in
those times a European manufacture; and as it was all brought from the
EastIndies,thedistanceofthecarriagemayinsomemeasureaccountfor
the greatness of price. The price, however, which a lady, it is said, would
sometimes pay for a piece of very fine linen, seems to have been equally
extravagant; and as linen was always either a European, or at farthest,
anEgyptianmanufacture,thishighpricecanbeaccountedforonlybythe
greatexpenseofthelabourwhichmusthavebeenemployedaboutit,and
531 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the expense of this labour again could arise from nothing but the awk-
wardnessofthemachinerywhichitmadeuseof. Thepriceoffinewoollens
too, though not quite so extravagant, seems however to have been much
abovethatofthepresenttimes. Somecloths,wearetoldbyPliny,dyedin

and eightpence the pound weight3. Others dyed in another manner cost
a thousand denarii the pound weight, or thirty-three pounds six shillings
and eightpence. The Roman pound, it must be remembered, contained
only twelve of our avoirdupois ounces. This high price, indeed, seems to
havebeenprincipallyowingtothedye. Buthadnottheclothsthemselves

inthatoftheancientstatuesconfirmshisobservation. Heinfersfromthis
that their dress must upon the whole have been cheaper than ours; but
the conclusion does not seem to follow. When the expense of fashionable
dress is very great, the variety must be very small. But when, by the im-
provements in the productive powers of manufacturing art and industry,
the expense of any one dress comes to be very moderate, the variety will
naturallybeverygreat. Therich,notbeingabletodistinguishthemselves
by the expense of any one dress, will naturally endeavour to do so by the
multitudeandvarietyoftheirdresses.
1502 [48] The greatest and most important branch of the commerce of every na-
tion,ithasalreadybeenobserved,isthatwhichiscarriedonbetweenthe
inhabitants of the town and those of the country. The inhabitants of the
town draw from the country the rude produce which constitutes both the
materials of their work and the fund of their subsistence; and they pay
for this rude produce by sending back to the country a certain portion of
it manufactured and prepared for immediate use. The trade which is car-
ried on between these two different sets of people consists ultimately in a
certainquantityofrudeproduceexchangedforacertainquantityofmanu-
facturedproduce. Thedearerthelatter,therefore,thecheapertheformer;

1503 [49] Thosesystems,therefore,which,preferringagriculturetoallotherem-

and foreign trade, act contrary to the very end which they propose, and
indirectlydiscouragethatveryspeciesofindustrywhichtheymeantopro-

ofindustrywhichitmeanstopromote. Thoseagriculturalsystems,onthe

extraordinary restraints, force from a particular species of industry some

subversive of the great purpose which it means to promote. It retards,
instead of accelerating, the progress of the society towards real wealth
andgreatness;anddiminishes,insteadofincreasing,therealvalueofthe
annualproduceofitslandandlabour.
1505 [51] All systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus
completely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty
establishesitselfofitsownaccord. Everyman,aslongashedoesnotviol-
ate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his
ownway,andtobringbothhisindustryandcapitalintocompetitionwith
those of any other man, or order of men. The sovereign is completely dis-
charged from a duty, in the attempting to perform which he must always
be exposed to innumerable delusions, and for the proper performance of
whichnohumanwisdomorknowledgecouldeverbesufficient;thedutyof
superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards
theemploymentsmostsuitabletotheinterestofthesociety. Accordingto
thesystemofnaturalliberty,thesovereignhasonlythreedutiestoattend

erect and maintain; because the profit could never repay the expense to
any individual or small number of individuals, though it may frequently

1506 [52] The proper performance of those several duties of the sovereign ne-
cessarily supposes a certain expense; and this expense again necessarily
requires a certain revenue to support it. In the following book, therefore,

1508 [2] Among nations of hunters, the lowest and rudest state of society, such

When its herds and flocks have consumed the forage of one part of the
country,itremovestoanother,andfromthattoathird. Inthedryseason
it comes down to the banks of the rivers; in the wet season it retires to
the upper country. When such a nation goes to war, the warriors will not
trust their herds and flocks to the feeble defence of their old men, their
women and children; and their old men, their women and children, will
notbeleftbehindwithoutdefenceandwithoutsubsistence. Thewholena- TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tion, besides, beingaccustomedtoawanderinglife, evenintimeofpeace,
easily takes the field in time of war. Whether it marches as an army, or
movesaboutasacompanyofherdsmen,thewayoflifeisnearlythesame,
though the object proposed by it be very different. They all go to war to-
gether,therefore,andeveryonedoesaswellashecan. AmongtheTartars, G.ed.p691
even the women have been frequently known to engage in battle. If they
conquer,whateverbelongstothehostiletribeistherecompenseofthevic-

flocks, but their women and children, become the booty of the conqueror.
Even the greater part of those who survive the action are obliged to sub-
mit to him for the sake of immediate subsistence. The rest are commonly
dissipatedanddispersedinthedesert.
1510 [4] The ordinary life, the ordinary exercises of a Tartar or Arab, prepare
himsufficientlyforwar. Running,wrestling,cudgel-playing,throwingthe
javelin, drawing the bow, etc., are the common pastimes of those who live
in the open air, and are all of them the images of war. When a Tartar or
Arab actually goes to war, he is maintained by his own herds and flocks
which he carries with him in the same manner as in peace. His chief or
sovereign, for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns, is at no sort of
expense in preparing him for the field; and when he is in it the chance of
plunderistheonlypaywhichheeitherexpectsorrequires.
1511 [5] An army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men.
The precarious subsistence which the chase affords could seldom allow a
greater number to keep together for any considerable time. An army of
shepherds, on the contrary, may sometimes amount to two or three hun-
dred thousand. As long as nothing stops their progress, as long as they

Nothing can be more contemptible than an Indian war in North America.
Nothing, on the contrary, can be more dreadful than Tartar invasion has G.ed.p692
frequently been in Asia. The judgment of Thucydides, that both Europe
andAsiacouldnotresisttheScythiansunited,hasbeenverifiedbytheex-
perienceofallages. Theinhabitantsoftheextensivebutdefencelessplains
of Scythia or Tartary have been frequently united under the dominion of
thechiefofsomeconqueringhordeorclan,andthehavocanddevastation
of Asia have always signalized their union. The inhabitants of the inhos-
pitable deserts of Arabia, the other great nation of shepherds, have never
beenunitedbutonce;underMahometandhisimmediatesuccessors. Their
union,whichwasmoretheeffectofreligiousenthusiasmthanofconquest,
was signalized in the same manner. If the hunting nations of America
should ever become shepherds, their neighbourhood would be much more
dangeroustotheEuropeancoloniesthanitisatpresent.
1512 [6] In a yet more advanced state of society, among those nations of hus-
537 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
bandmen who have little foreign commerce, and no other manufactures
but those coarse and household ones which almost every private family
prepares for its own use, every man, in the same manner, either is a war-
rior or easily becomes such. They who live by agriculture generally pass
the whole day in the open air, exposed to all the inclemencies of the sea- G.ed.p693
sons. The hardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues
of war, to some of which their necessary occupations bear a great ana-
logy. The necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the
trenches, and to fortify a camp as well as to enclose a field. The ordinary

1513 [7] Agriculture,eveninitsrudestandloweststate,supposesasettlement:
some sort of fixed habitation which cannot be abandoned without great
loss. Whenanationofmerehusbandmen,therefore,goestowar,thewhole
people cannot take the field together. The old men, the women and chil-
dren,atleast,mustremainathometotakecareofthehabitation. Allthe
menofthemilitaryage,however,maytakethefield,and,insmallnations
of this kind, have frequently done so. In every nation the men of the mil-
itary age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or a fifth part of the
whole body of the people. If the campaign, should begin after seed-time,
andendbeforeharvest,boththehusbandmanandhisprincipallabourers
can be spared from the farm without much loss. He trusts that the work
which must be done in the meantime can be well enough executed by the
old men, the women, and the children. He is not unwilling, therefore, to
serve without pay during a short campaign, and it frequently costs the
sovereignorcommonwealthaslittletomaintainhiminthefieldastopre-
pare him for it. The citizens of all the different states of ancient Greece
seemto haveservedinthis mannertillafter the secondPersianwar; and
the people of Peloponnesus till after the Peloponnesian war. The Pelo-
ponnesians, Thucydides observes, generally left the field in the summer,
and returned home to reap the harvest. The Roman people under their G.ed.p694
kings, and during the first ages of the republic, served in the same man-
ner. ItwasnottillthesiegeofVeiithattheywhostayedathomebeganto
contribute something towards maintaining those who went to war. In the
European monarchies, which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman
empire, both before and for some time after the establishment of what is
properly called the feudal law, the great lords, with all their immediate
dependents, used to serve the crown at their own expense. In the field, in
the same manner as at home, they maintained themselves by their own
revenue,andnotbyanystipendorpaywhichtheyreceivedfromtheking
uponthatparticularoccasion.
538 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1514 [8] In a more advanced state of society, two different causes contribute to
render it altogether impossible that they who take the field should main-
tain themselves at theirown expense. Thosetwo causesare, theprogress
ofmanufactures,andtheimprovementintheartofwar.
1515 [9] Though a husbandman should be employed in an expedition, provided
it begins after seed-time and ends before harvest, the interruption of his
business will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his rev-
enue. Without the intervention of his labour, nature does herself the
greater part of the work which remains to be done. But the moment that G.ed.p695
anartificer,asmith,acarpenter,oraweaver,forexample,quitshiswork-
house, the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up. Nature does
nothing for him, he does all for himself. When he takes the field, there-
fore,indefenceofthepublic,ashehasnorevenuetomaintainhimself,he
must necessarily be maintained by the public. But in a country of which
a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and manufacturers, a great
part of the people who go to war must be drawn from those classes, and
must therefore be maintained by the public as long as they are employed
initsservice.
1516 [10] When the art of war, too, has gradually grown up to be a very intric-
ate and complicated science, when the event of war ceases to be determ-
ined,asinthefirstagesofsociety,byasingleirregularskirmishorbattle,

ants was, after a certain period, universally exchanged for a payment in

1517 [11] The number of those who can go to war, in proportion to the whole
number of the people, is necessarily much smaller in a civilised than in a
rude state of society. In a civilised society, as the soldiers are maintained
altogether by the labour of those who are not soldiers, the number of the
former can never exceed what the latter can maintain, over and above
maintaining,inamannersuitabletotheirrespectivestations,boththem-
selvesandtheotherofficersofgovernmentandlawwhomtheyareobliged
to maintain. In the little agrarian states of ancient Greece, a fourth or G.ed.p696
a fifth part of the whole body of the people considered themselves as sol-
539 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
diers, and would sometimes, it is said, take a field. Among the civilised
nations of modern Europe, it is commonly computed that not more than
one-hundredth part of the inhabitants in any country can be employed as
soldiers without ruin to the country which pays the expenses of their ser-
vice.
1518 [12] The expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have be-

the field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth. In

was a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free
citizen. Ineverycitythereseemstohavebeenapublicfield,inwhich,un-
der the protection of the public magistrate, the young people were taught
their different exercises by different masters. In this very simple institu-
tion consisted the whole expense which any Grecian state seems ever to
have been at in preparing its citizens for war. In ancient Rome the ex-
ercises of the Campus Martius answered the same purpose with those of
the Gymnasium in ancient Greece. Under the feudal governments, the
many public ordinances that the citizens of every district should practise
archery as well as several other military exercises were intended for pro-
moting the same purpose, but do not seem to have promoted it so well.

thoseordinances,orfromsomeothercause,theyappeartohavebeenuni-
versally neglected; and in the progress of all those governments, military
exercisesseemtohavegonegraduallyintodisuseamongthegreatbodyof
thepeople.
1519 [13] In the republics of ancient Greece and Rome, during the whole period
of their existence, and under the feudal governments for a considerable
time after their first establishment, the trade of a soldier was not a sep-
arate, distinct trade, which constituted the sole or principal occupation of
a particular class of citizens. Every subject of the state, whatever might G.ed.p697

sideredhimself,uponallordinaryoccasions,asfitlikewisetoexercisethe

1520 [14] The art of war, however, as it is certainly the noblest of all arts, so in
the progress of improvement it necessarily becomes one of the most com-
plicated among them. The state of the mechanical, as well as of some
other arts, with which it is necessarily connected, determines the degree
ofperfectiontowhichitiscapableofbeingcarriedatanyparticulartime.
But in order to carry it to this degree of perfection, it is necessary that
it should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of
citizens, andthedivisionoflabourisasnecessaryfortheimprovementof
this, as of every other art. Into other arts the division of labour is natur-
allyintroducedbytheprudenceofindividuals,whofindthattheypromote
their private interest better by confining themselves to a particular trade
540 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
than by exercising a great number. But it is the wisdom of the state only
which can render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separate and
distinct from all others. A private citizen who, in time of profound peace,
and without any particular encouragement from the public, should spend
the greater part of his time in military exercises, might, no doubt, both
improve himself very much in them, and amuse himself very well; but
he certainly would not promote his own interest. It is the wisdom of the
stateonlywhichcanrenderitforhisinteresttogiveupthegreaterpartof

wisdom,evenwhentheircircumstanceshadbecomesuchthatthepreser-

as by those of the town, and the great body of the people becomes alto-

1523 [17] Itmayeither,first,bymeansofaveryrigorouspolice,andinspiteofthe
whole bent of the interest, genius, and inclinations of the people, enforce
the practice of military exercises, and oblige either all the citizens of the
military age, or a certain number of them, to join in some measure the
trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or profession they may happen
tocarryon.

1525 [19] If the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients, its milit-
aryforceissaidtoconsistinamilitia;iftothesecond,itissaidtoconsist
in a standing army. The practice of military exercises is the sole or prin-
cipal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army, and the maintenance
or pay which the state affords them is the principal and ordinary fund of
541 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
their subsistence. The practice of military exercises is only the occasional
occupation of the soldiers of a militia, and they derive the principal and
ordinary fund of their subsistence from some other occupation. In a mi-
litia, the character of the labourer, artificer, or tradesman, predominates
over that of the soldier; in a standing army, that of the soldier predomin-
atesovereveryothercharacter: andinthisdistinctionseemstoconsistthe
essentialdifferencebetweenthosetwodifferentspeciesofmilitaryforce.
1526 [20] Militias have been of several different kinds. In some countries the
citizensdestinedfordefendingthestatesseemtohavebeenexercisedonly,
without being, if I may say so, regimented; that is, without being divided
into separate and distinct bodies of troops, each of which performed its
exercisesunderitsownproperandpermanentofficers. Intherepublicsof
ancient Greece and Rome, each citizen, as long as he remained at home,
seemstohavepractisedhisexerciseseitherseparatelyandindependently,
or with such of his equals as he liked best, and not to have been attached
to any particular body of troops till he was actually called upon to take
the field. In other countries, the militia has not only been exercised, but G.ed.p699
regimented. In England, in Switzerland, and, I believe, in every other
countryofmodernEuropewhereanyimperfectmilitaryforceofthiskind
hasbeenestablished,everymilitiamanis, evenintimeofpeace,attached
to a particular body of troops, which performs its exercises under its own
properandpermanentofficers.
1527 [21] Before the invention of firearms, that army was superior in which the
soldiershad,eachindividually,thegreatestskillanddexterityintheuseof
their arms. Strength and agility of body were of the highest consequence,
and commonly determined the state of battles. But this skill and dexter-
ity in the use of their arms could be acquired only, in the same manner
as fencing is at present, by practising, not in great bodies, but each man
separately, in a particular school, under a particular master, or with his
own particular equals and companions. Since the invention of firearms,
strength and agility of body, or even extraordinary dexterity and skill in
the use of arms, though they are far from being of no consequence, are,
however, of less consequence. The nature of the weapon, though it by no
means puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful, puts him more
nearly so than he ever was before. All the dexterity and skill, it is sup-
posed, which are necessary for using it, can be well enough acquired by
practisingingreatbodies.
1528 [22] Regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command are qualities
which, in modern armies, are of more importance towards determining
the fate of battles than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of
theirarms. Butthenoiseoffirearms,thesmoke,andtheinvisibledeathto

siderable degree of this regularity, order, and prompt obedience, even in
542 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the beginning of a modern battle. In an ancient battle there was no noise
but what arose from the human voice; there was no smoke, there was no
invisible cause of wounds or death. Every man, till some mortal weapon
actuallydidapproachhim,sawclearlythatnosuchweaponwasnearhim.
In these circumstances, and among troops who had some confidence in
their own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms, it must have been

and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated. But the habits of reg-
ularity, order, and prompt obedience to command can be acquired only by
troopswhichareexercisedingreatbodies.
1529 [23] A militia, however, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined
or exercised, must always be much inferior to a well-disciplined and well- G.ed.p700
exercisedstandingarmy.
1530 [24] The soldiers who are exercised only once a week, or once a month, can
never be so expert in the use of their arms as those who are exercised
everyday,oreveryotherday;andthoughthiscircumstancemaynotbeof
somuchconsequenceinmodernasitwasinancienttimes,yettheacknow-
ledged superiority of the Prussian troops, owing, it is said, very much to
their superior expertness in their exercise, may satisfy us that it is, even
atthisday,ofveryconsiderableconsequence.
1531 [25] The soldiers who are bound to obey their officer only once a week or
once a month, and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their
own affairs their own way, without being in any respect accountable to
him, can never be under the same awe in his presence, can never have
the same disposition to ready obedience, with those whose whole life and
conductareeverydaydirectedbyhim,andwhoeverydayevenriseandgo

iscalleddiscipline,orinthehabitofreadyobedience,amilitiamustalways
bestillmoreinferiortoastandingarmythanitmaysometimesbeinwhat
is called the manual exercise, or in the management and use of its arms.
But in modern war the habit of ready and instant obedience is of much
greater consequence than a considerable superiority in the management
ofarms.
1532 [26] Those militias which, like the Tartar or Arab militia, go to war under
the same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace, are by
far the best. In respect for their officers, in the habit of ready obedience, G.ed.p701
they approach nearest to standing armies. The highland militia, when it
servedunderitsownchieftains,hadsomeadvantageofthesamekind. As
the highlanders, however, were not wandering, but stationary shepherds,
astheyhadallafixedhabitation,andwerenot,inpeaceabletimes,accus-
tomed to follow their chieftain from place to place, so in time of war they
werelesswillingtofollowhimtoanyconsiderabledistance,ortocontinue
for any long time in the field. When they had acquired any booty they
were eager to return home, and his authority was seldom sufficient to de-
543 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tain them. In point of obedience they were always much inferior to what
is reported of the Tartars and Arabs. As the highlanders too, from their
stationary life, spend less of their time in the open air, they were always
less accustomed to military exercises, and were less expert in the use of
theirarmsthantheTartarsandArabsaresaidtobe.
1533 [27] A militia of any kind, it must be observed, however, which has served
for several successive campaigns in the field, becomes in every respect a
standing army. The soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their
arms, and, being constantly under the command of their officers, are ha-
bituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing
armies. What they were before they took the field is of little importance.
Theynecessarilybecomeineveryrespectastandingarmyaftertheyhave
passedafewcampaignsinit. ShouldthewarinAmericadragoutthrough
another campaign, the American militia may become in every respect a
match for that standing army of which the valour appeared, in the last
war, at least not inferior to that of the hardiest veterans of France and
Spain.
1534 [28] This distinction being well understood, the history of all ages, it will
be found, bears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well-
regulatedstandingarmyhasoveramilitia.
1535 [29] Oneofthefirststandingarmiesofwhichwehaveanydistinctaccount,
in any well authenticated history, is that of Philip of Macedon. His fre- G.ed.p702
quent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some of the
GreekcitiesintheneighbourhoodofMacedon,graduallyformedhistroops,
which in the beginning were probably militia, to the exact discipline of a
standing army. When he was at peace, which he was very seldom, and
neverforanylongtimetogether,hewascarefulnottodisbandthatarmy.
It vanquished and subdued, after a long and violent struggle, indeed, the
gallant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient
Greece, and afterwards, with very little struggle, the effeminate and ill-
exercisedmilitiaofthegreatPersianempire. ThefalloftheGreekrepub-
licsandofthePersianempirewastheeffectoftheirresistiblesuperiority
which a standing army has over every sort of militia. It is the first great
revolution in the affairs of mankind of which history has preserved any
distinctorcircumstantialaccount.
1536 [30] The fall of Carthage, and the consequent elevation of Rome, is the
second. Allthevarietiesinthefortuneofthosetwofamousrepublicsmay
verywellbeaccountedforfromthesamecause.
1537 [31] From the end of the first to the beginning of the second Carthaginian
war the armies of Carthage were continually in the field, and employed
under three great generals, who succeeded one another in the command:
Hamilcar, his son-in-law Asdrubal, and his son Hannibal; first in chas-
tising their own rebellious slaves, afterwards in subduing the revolted
nations of Africa, and, lastly, in conquering the great kingdom of Spain.
The army which Hannibal led from Spain into Italy must necessarily, in
544 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
thosedifferentwars,havebeengraduallyformedtotheexactdisciplineof
astandingarmy. TheRomans,inthemeantime,thoughtheyhadnotbeen
altogether at peace, yet they had not, during this period, been engaged in
anywarofverygreatconsequence,andtheirmilitarydiscipline,itisgen-
erally said, was a good deal relaxed. The Roman armies which Hannibal
encounteredatTrebia,Thrasymenus,andCannæweremilitiaopposedto
astandingarmy. Thiscircumstance,itisprobable,contributedmorethan
anyothertodeterminethefateofthosebattles.
1538 [32] The standing army which Hannibal left behind him in Spain had the
like superiority over the militia which the Romans sent to oppose it, and
in a few years, under the command of his brother, the younger Asdrubal, G.ed.p703
expelledthemalmostentirelyfromthatcountry.
1539 [33] Hannibal was ill supplied from home. The Roman militia, being con-
tinually in the field, became in the progress of the war a well disciplined
and well-exercised standing army, and the superiority of Hannibal grew
every day less and less. Asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole,
or almost the whole of the standing army which he commanded in Spain,
to the assistance of his brother in Italy. In this march he is said to have
been misled by his guides, and in a country which he did not know, was
surprised and attacked by another standing army, in every respect equal
orsuperiortohisown,andwasentirelydefeated.
1540 [34] WhenAsdrubalhadleftSpain,thegreatScipiofoundnothingtooppose
him but a militia inferior to his own. He conquered and subdued that
militia, and, in the course of the war, his own militia necessarily became
a well-disciplined and well-exercised standing army. That standing army
was afterwards carried to Africa, where it found nothing but a militia to
oppose it. In order to defend Carthage it became necessary to recall the
standing army of Hannibal. The disheartened and frequently defeated
African militiajoined it, and, at thebattle of Zama, composedthe greater
part of the troops of Hannibal. The event of that day determined the fate
ofthetworivalrepublics.
1541 [35] From the end of the second Carthaginian war till the fall of the Ro-
man republic, the armies of Rome were in every respect standing armies.
The standing army of Macedon made some resistance to their arms. In
the height of their grandeur it cost them two great wars, and three great
battles, to subdue that little kingdom, of which the conquest would prob-
ably have been still more difficult had it not been for the cowardice of its
last king. The militias of all the civilised nations of the ancient world, of
Greece, of Syria, and of Egypt, made but a feeble resistance to the stand-
ing armies of Rome. The militias of some barbarous nations defended
themselves much better. The Scythian or Tartar militia, which Mithrid-
ates drew from the countries north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, were
the most formidable enemies whom the Romans had to encounter after
the second Carthaginian war. The Parthian and German militias, too,
werealwaysrespectable,anduponseveraloccasionsgainedveryconsider-
545 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
able advantages over the Roman armies. In general, however, and when
the Roman armies were well commanded, they appear to have been very
muchsuperior;andiftheRomansdidnotpursuethefinalconquesteither
of Parthia or Germany, it was probably because they judged that it was
not worth while to add those two barbarous countries to an empire which
was already too large. The ancient Parthians appear to have been a na-
tion of Scythian or Tartar extraction, and to have always retained a good G.ed.p704
deal of the manners of their ancestors. The ancient Germans were, like
the Scythians or Tartars, a nation of wandering shepherds, who went to
warunderthesamechiefswhomtheywereaccustomedtofollowinpeace.
Their militia was exactly of the same kind with that of the Scythians or
Tartars,fromwhom,too,theywereprobablydescended.
1542 [36] ManydifferentcausescontributedtorelaxthedisciplineoftheRoman
armies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the
daysoftheirgrandeur,whennoenemyappearedcapableofopposingthem,
theirheavyarmourwaslaidasideasunnecessarilyburdensome, theirla-
bourious exercises were neglected as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the

546 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1543 [37] ThemilitaryforceoftheGermanandScythiannationswhoestablished
themselvesupontheruinsofthewesternempirecontinuedforsometime
to be of the same kind in their new settlements as it had been in their
original country. It was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen, which,
in time of war, took the field under the command of the same chieftains
whomitwasaccustomedtoobeyinpeace. Itwas,therefore,tolerablywell
exercised, and tolerably well disciplined. As arts and industry advanced,
however, the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed, and the great
body of the people had less time to spare for military exercises. Both the
disciplineandtheexerciseofthefeudalmilitia, therefore,wentgradually
toruin,andstandingarmiesweregraduallyintroducedtosupplytheplace
of it. When the expedient of a standing army, besides, had once been ad-
opted by one civilised nation, it became necessary that all its neighbours
should follow their example. They soon found that their safety depended
upontheirdoingso,andthattheirownmilitiawasaltogetherincapableof
resistingtheattackofsuchanarmy.
1544 [38] The soldiers of a standing army, though they may never have seen an
enemy, yethavefrequentlyappearedtopossessallthecourageofveteran
troops and the very moment that they took the field to have been fit to
face the hardiest and most experienced veterans. In 1756, when the Rus-
sianarmymarchedintoPoland,thevalouroftheRussiansoldiersdidnot
appear inferior to that of the Prussians, at that time supposed to be the
hardiest and most experienced veterans in Europe. The Russian empire,
however, had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before, and
could at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy.
When the Spanish war broke out in 1739, England had enjoyed a pro-
found peace for about eight-and-twenty years. The valour of her soldiers,
however,farfrombeingcorruptedbythatlongpeace,wasnevermoredis-
tinguishedthanintheattemptuponCarthagena,thefirstunfortunateex-
ploit of that unfortunate war. In a long peace the generals, perhaps, may
sometimes forget their skill; but, where a well-regulated standing army
hasbeenkeptup,thesoldiersseemnevertoforgettheirvalour.
1545 [39] When a civilised nation depends for its defence upon a militia, it is at
alltimesexposedtobeconqueredbyanybarbarousnationwhichhappens
tobeinitsneighbourhood. Thefrequentconquestsofallthecivilisedcoun-
tries in Asia by the Tartars sufficiently demonstrates the natural superi-
oritywhichthemilitiaofabarbaroushasoverthatofacivilisednation. A
well-regulated standing army is superior to every militia. Such an army, G.ed.p706
as it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilised nation, so it can
alone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and barbarous
neighbour. It is only by means of a standing army, therefore, that the
civilization of any country can be perpetuated, or even preserved for any
considerabletime.
1546 [40] Asitisonlybymeansofawell-regulatedstandingarmythatacivilised
countrycanbedefended,soitisonlybymeansofitthatabarbarouscoun-
547 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
try can be suddenly and tolerably civilised. A standing army establishes,
with an irresistible force, the law of the sovereign through the remotest
provincesoftheempire,andmaintainssomedegreeofregulargovernment
in countries which could not otherwise admit of any. Whoever examines,
with attention, the improvements which Peter the Great introduced into
the Russian empire, will find that they almost all resolve themselves into
the establishment of a well regulated standingarmy. It is theinstrument
which executes and maintains all his other regulations. That degree of
orderandinternalpeacewhichthatempirehaseversinceenjoyedisalto-
getherowingtotheinfluenceofthatarmy.
1547 [41] Men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as
dangerous to liberty. It certainly is so wherever the interest of the gen-
eral and that of the principal officers are not necessarily connected with
the support of the constitution of the state. The standing army of Caesar
destroyed the Roman republic. The standing army of Cromwell turned
the Long Parliament out of doors. But where the sovereign is himself the
general, and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief of-
ficers of the army, where the military force is placed under the command
of those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil author-
ity, because they have themselves the greatest share of that authority, a
standing army can never be dangerous to liberty. On the contrary, it may G.ed.p707
in some cases be favourable to liberty. The security which it gives to the
sovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome jealousy, which, in some
modern republics, seems to watch over the minutest actions, and to be at
alltimesreadytodisturbthepeaceofeverycitizen. Wherethesecurityof
themagistrate,thoughsupportedbytheprincipalpeopleofthecountry,is
endangered by every popular discontent; where a small tumult is capable
of bringing about in a few hours a great revolution, the whole authority
of government must be employed to suppress and punish every murmur
and complaint against it. To a sovereign, on the contrary, who feels him-
self supported, not only by the natural aristocracy of the country, but by
a well-regulated standing army, the rudest, the most groundless, and the
most licentious remonstrances can give little disturbance. He can safely
pardon or neglect them, and his consciousness of his own superiority nat-
urally disposes him to do so. That degree of liberty which approaches to
licentiousnesscanbetoleratedonlyincountrieswherethesovereignisse-
cured by a well-regulated standing army. It is in such countries only that
thepublicsafetydoesnotrequirethatthesovereignshouldbetrustedwith
anydiscretionarypowerforsuppressingeventheimpertinentwantonness
ofthislicentiousliberty.
1548 [42] The first duty of the sovereign, therefore, that of defending the soci-
ety from the violence and injustice of other independent societies, grows
graduallymoreandmoreexpensiveasthesocietyadvancesincivilization.
Themilitaryforceofthesociety,whichoriginallycostthesovereignnoex-
pense either in time of peace or in time of war, must, in the progress of
548 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
improvement, first be maintained by him in time of war, and afterwards
evenintimeofpeace.
1549 [43] The great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of
firearmshasenhancedstillfurtherboththeexpenseofexercisinganddis-
ciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace, and that of
employing them in time of war. Both their arms and their ammunition
are become more expensive. A musket is a more expensive machine than G.ed.p708
a javelin or a bow and arrows; a cannon or a mortar than a balista or a
catapulta. Thepowderwhichisspentinamodernreviewislostirrecover-
ably, and occasions a very considerable expense. The javeline and arrows
which were thrown or shot in an ancient one could easily be picked up
again, and were besides of very little value. The cannon and the mortar
are not only much dearer, but much heavier machines than the balista or
catapulta,andrequireagreaterexpense,notonlytopreparethemforthe
field,buttocarrythemtoit. Asthesuperiorityofthemodernartillerytoo
over that of the ancients is very great, it has become much more difficult,
and consequently much more expensive, to fortify a town so as to resist
evenforafewweekstheattackofthatsuperiorartillery. Inmoderntimes
manydifferentcausescontributetorenderthedefenceofthesocietymore
expensive. Theunavoidableeffectsofthenaturalprogressofimprovement
have, in this respect, been a good deal enhanced by a great revolution in
theartofwar,towhichamereaccident,theinventionofgunpowder,seems

1550 [44] In modern war the great expense of firearms gives an evident advant-
agetothenationwhichcanbestaffordthatexpense, andconsequentlyto

it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilised. The
invention of firearms, an invention which at first sight appears to be so
pernicious, is certainly favourable both to the permanency and to the ex-
tensionofcivilization.
PART THIRD
Of the Expense of Justice
1551 [1] The second duty of the sovereign, that of protecting, as far as possible,
everymemberofthesocietyfromtheinjusticeoroppressionofeveryother
memberofit,orthedutyofestablishinganexactadministrationofjustice, G.ed.p709
requires, too, very different degrees of expense in the different periods of
society.
1552 [2] Among nations of hunters, as there is scarce any property, or at least
549 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
none that exceeds the value of two or three days’ labour, so there is sel-
dom any established magistrate or any regular administration of justice.
Menwhohavenopropertycaninjureoneanotheronlyintheirpersonsor
reputations. But when one man kills, wounds, beats, or defames another,
though he to whom the injury is done suffers, he who does it receives no
benefit. It is otherwise with the injuries to property. The benefit of the
personwhodoestheinjuryisoftenequaltothelossofhimwhosuffersit.
Envy, malice, or resentment are the only passions which can prompt one
mantoinjureanotherinhispersonorreputation. Butthegreaterpartof
menarenotveryfrequentlyundertheinfluenceofthosepassions,andthe
very worst of men are so only occasionally. As their gratification too, how
agreeablesoeveritmaybetocertaincharacters, isnotattendedwithany
real or permanent advantage, it is in the greater part of men commonly
restrainedbyprudentialconsiderations. Menmaylivetogetherinsociety
with some tolerabledegree ofsecurity, thoughthere isno civilmagistrate
to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and am-
bition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present
ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property,

theaffluenceofthefewsupposestheindigenceofthemany. Theaffluence
of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven

The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily
requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no prop-
erty, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days’ labour,
civilgovernmentisnotsonecessary.
1553 [3] Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the neces-
sityofcivilgovernmentgraduallygrowsupwiththeacquisitionofvaluable
property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination
graduallygrowupwiththegrowthofthatvaluableproperty.
1554 [4] The causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination,
orwhichnaturally,andantecedenttoanycivilinstitution,givesomemen
somesuperiorityoverthegreaterpartoftheirbrethren,seemtobefourin
number.
1555 [5] Thefirstofthosecausesorcircumstancesisthesuperiorityofpersonal G.ed.p711
qualifications, of strength, beauty, and agility of body; of wisdom and vir-
tue, of prudence, justice, fortitude, and moderation of mind. The qualific-
550 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ations of the body, unless supported by those of the mind, can give little
authority in any period of society. He is a very strong man, who, by mere
strength of body, can force two weak ones to obey him. The qualifications
of the mind can alone give a very great authority. They are, however, in-
visible qualities; always disputable, and generally disputed. No society,
whether barbarous or civilised, has ever found it convenient to settle the
rulesofprecedencyofrankandsubordinationaccordingtothoseinvisible
qualities;butaccordingtosomethingthatismoreplainandpalpable.
1556 [6] The second of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of age.

1557 [7] The third of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of for-
tune. The authority of riches, however, though great in every age of so-
ciety, is perhaps greatest in the rudest age of society which admits of any
considerable inequality of fortune. A Tartar chief, the increase of whose G.ed.p711

ploythatincreaseinanyotherwaythaninmaintainingathousandmen.
The rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured pro-
duce, any trinkets or baubles of any kind, for which he can exchange that
partofhisrudeproducewhichisoverandabovehisownconsumption. The
thousand men whom he thus maintains, depending entirely upon him for
theirsubsistence,mustbothobeyhisordersinwar,andsubmittohisjur-
isdictioninpeace. Heisnecessarilyboththeirgeneralandtheirjudge,and

anopulentandcivilisedsociety,amanmaypossessamuchgreaterfortune
and yet not be able to command a dozen people. Though the produce of
his estate may be sufficient to maintain, and may perhaps actually main-
tain, morethanathousandpeople, yetasthosepeoplepayforeverything
which they get from him, as he gives scarce anything to anybody but in
exchangeforanequivalent,thereisscarceanybodywhoconsidershimself
asentirelydependentuponhim,andhisauthorityextendsonlyoverafew
menial servants. The authority of fortune, however, is very great even in
an opulent and civilised society. That it is much greater than that either
of age or of personal qualities has been the constant complaint of every
periodofsocietywhichadmittedofanyconsiderableinequalityoffortune.
551 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
The first period of society, that of hunters, admits of no such inequality.
Universalpovertyestablishestheiruniversalequality,andthesuperiority
eitherofageorofpersonalqualitiesarethefeeblebutthesolefoundations
ofauthorityandsubordination. Thereisthereforelittleornoauthorityor
subordination in this period of society. The second period of society, that G.ed.p713
of shepherds, admits of very great inequalities of fortune, and there is no
periodinwhichthesuperiorityoffortunegivessogreatauthoritytothose
whopossessit. Thereisnoperiodaccordinglyinwhichauthorityandsub-
ordination are more perfectly established. The authority of an Arabian
sherifisverygreat;thatofaTartarkhanaltogetherdespotical.
1558 [8] The fourth of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of birth.
Superiorityofbirthsupposesanancientsuperiorityoffortuneinthefam-
ily of the person who claims it. All families are equally ancient; and the
ancestors of the prince, though they may be better known, cannot well
be more numerous than those of the beggar. Antiquity of family means
everywhere the antiquity either of wealth, or of that greatness which is
commonly either founded upon wealth, or accompanied with it. Upstart
greatnessiseverywherelessrespectedthanancientgreatness. Thehatred
of usurpers, the love of the family of an ancient monarch, are, in a great
measure, founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the
former, and upon their veneration for the latter. As a military officer sub-
mits without reluctance to the authority of a superior by whom he has
always been commanded, but cannot bear that his inferior should be set
over his head, so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their
ancestorshavealwayssubmitted;butarefiredwithindignationwhenan-
otherfamily, inwhomtheyhadneveracknowledgedanysuchsuperiority,
assumesadominionoverthem.
1559 [9] The distinction of birth, being subsequent to the inequality of fortune,
canhavenoplaceinnationsofhunters,amongwhomallmen,beingequal
in fortune, must likewise be very nearly equal in birth. The son of a wise
andbravemanmay,indeed,evenamongthem,besomewhatmorerespec-
ted than a man of equal merit who has the misfortune to be the son of a
fooloracoward. Thedifference,however,willnotbeverygreat;andthere G.ed.p714
never was, I believe, a great family in the world whose illustration was
entirelyderivedfromtheinheritanceofwisdomandvirtue.
1560 [10] Thedistinctionofbirthnotonlymay,butalwaysdoestakeplaceamong
nations of shepherds. Such nations are always strangers to every sort of
luxury, and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by
improvidentprofusion. Therearenonationsaccordinglywhoaboundmore
in families revered and honoured on account of their descent from a long
raceofgreatandillustriousancestors,becausetherearenonationsamong
whomwealthislikelytocontinuelongerinthesamefamilies.
1561 [11] Birth and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which princip-
ally set one man above another. They are the two great sources of per-
sonal distinction, and are therefore the principal causes which naturally
552 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
establishauthorityandsubordinationamongmen. Amongnationsofshep-
herds both those causes operate with their full force. The great shepherd
or herdsman, respected on account of his great wealth, and of the great
numberofthosewhodependuponhimforsubsistence,andreveredonac-
countofthenoblenessofhisbirth,andoftheimmemorialantiquityofhis
illustrious family, has a natural authority over all the inferior shepherds
or herdsmen of his horde or clan. He can command the united force of a
greaternumberofpeoplethananyofthem. Hismilitarypowerisgreater
than that of any of them. In time of war they are all of them naturally
disposed to muster themselves under his banner, rather than under that
of any other person, and his birth and fortune thus naturally procure to
him some sort of executive power. By commanding, too, the united force
of a greater number of people than any of them, he is best able to compel
any one of them who may have injured another to compensate the wrong.
Heistheperson, therefore, towhomallthosewhoaretooweaktodefend
themselves naturally look up for protection. It is to him that they natur-
ally complain of the injuries which they imagine have been done to them,
andhisinterpositioninsuchcasesismoreeasilysubmittedto,evenbythe
person complained of, than that of any other person would be. His birth
andfortunethusnaturallyprocurehimsomesortofjudicialauthority.
1562 [12] It is in the age of shepherds, in the second period of society, that the G.ed.p715
inequalityoffortunefirstbeginstotakeplace,andintroducesamongmen
adegreeofauthorityandsubordinationwhichcouldnotpossiblyexistbe-
fore. It thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which
is indispensably necessary for its own preservation: and it seems to do
thisnaturally,andevenindependentoftheconsiderationofthatnecessity.
The consideration of that necessity comes no doubt afterwards to contrib-
ute very much to maintain and secure that authority and subordination.
The rich, in particular, are necessarily interested to support that order of
thingswhichcanalonesecuretheminthepossessionoftheirownadvant-
ages. Menofinferiorwealthcombinetodefendthoseofsuperiorwealthin
thepossessionoftheirproperty,inorderthatmenofsuperiorwealthmay
combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shep-
herds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks
depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman;
that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his
greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his
powerofkeepingtheirinferiorsinsubordinationtothem. Theyconstitute
a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the prop-
ertyandtosupporttheauthorityoftheirownlittlesovereigninorderthat
he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority.
Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is
inrealityinstitutedforthedefenceoftherichagainstthepoor,orofthose
whohavesomepropertyagainstthosewhohavenoneatall.
1563 [13] The judicial authority of such a sovereign, however, far from being a
553 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
cause of expense, was for a long time a source of revenue to him. The
persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it,
and a present never failed to accompany a petition. After the authority
of the sovereign, too, was thoroughly established, the person found guilty,
overandabovethesatisfactionwhichhewasobligedtomaketotheparty,
waslikewiseforcedtopayanamercementtothesovereign. Hehadgiven
trouble,hehaddisturbed,hehadbrokethepeaceofhislordtheking,and G.ed.p716
for those offences an amercement was thought due. In the Tartar govern-
ments of Asia, in the governments of Europe which were founded by the
GermanandScythiannationswhooverturnedtheRomanempire,thead-
ministration of justice was a considerable source of revenue, both to the
sovereignandtoallthelesserchiefsorlordswhoexercisedunderhimany

someparticularterritoryordistrict. Originallyboththesovereignandthe
inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in their own persons. Af-
terwardstheyuniversallyfounditconvenienttodelegateittosomesubsti-
tute,bailiff,orjudge. Thissubstitute,however,wasstillobligedtoaccount
to his principal or constituent for the profits of the jurisdiction. Whoever
readsthe1 instructionswhichweregiventothejudgesofthecircuitinthe
time of Henry II will see clearly that those judges were a sort of itinerant
factors,sentroundthecountryforthepurposeoflevyingcertainbranches
of the king’s revenue. In those days the administration of justice not only
afforded a certain revenue to the sovereign, but to procure this revenue
seems to have been one of the principal advantages which he proposed to
obtainbytheadministrationofjustice.
1564 [14] Thisschemeofmakingtheadministrationofjusticesubservienttothe
purposesofrevenuecouldscarcefailtobeproductiveofseveralverygross
abuses. The person who applied for justice with a large present in his
handwaslikelytogetsomethingmorethanjustice; whilehewhoapplied
foritwithasmallonewaslikelytogetsomethingless. Justice,too,might
frequently be delayed in order that this present might be repeated. The
amercement, besides, of the person complained of, might frequently sug- G.ed.p717
gest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong, even when he had
not really been so. That such abuses were far from being uncommon the
ancienthistoryofeverycountryinEuropebearswitness.
1565 [15] Whenthesovereignorchiefexercisedhisjudicialauthorityinhisown
person,howmuchsoeverhemightabuseit,itmusthavebeenscarcepos-
sible to get any redress, because there could seldom be anybody powerful
enough to call him to account. When he exercised it by a bailiff, indeed,
redress might sometimes be had. If it was for his own benefit only that
the bailiff had been guilty of any act of injustice, the sovereign himself
mightnotalwaysbeunwillingtopunishhim,ortoobligehimtorepairthe
wrong. But if it was for the benefit of his sovereign, if it was in order to

554 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
make court to the person who appointed him and who might prefer him,
thathehadcommittedanyactofoppression,redresswoulduponmostoc-
casions be as impossible as if the sovereign had committed it himself. In
all barbarous governments, accordingly, in all those ancient governments
of Europe in particular which were founded upon the ruins of the Roman
empire, theadministrationofjusticeappearsforalongtimetohavebeen
extremely corrupt, far from being quite equal and impartial even under
thebestmonarchs,andaltogetherprofligateundertheworst.
1566 [16] Among nations of shepherds, where the sovereign or chief is only the
greatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan, he is maintained in
the same manner as any of his vassals or subjects, by the increase of his
ownherdsorflocks. Amongthosenationsofhusbandmenwhoarebutjust
come out of the shepherd state, and who are not much advanced beyond
thatstate,suchastheGreektribesappeartohavebeenaboutthetimeof
the Trojan war, and our German and Scythian ancestors when they first
settled upon the ruins of the western empire, the sovereign or chief is, in
the same manner, only the greatest landlord of the country, and is main-
tained, in the same manner as any other landlord, by a revenue derived
from his own private estate, or from what, in modern Europe, was called
the demesne of the crown. His subjects, upon ordinary occasions, contrib-
uted nothing to his support, except when, in order to protect them from
the oppression of some of their fellow-subjects, they stand in need of his
authority. Thepresentswhichtheymakehimuponsuchoccasionsconsti-
tute the whole ordinary revenue, the whole of the emoluments which, ex-
cept perhaps upon some very extraordinary emergencies, he derives from
his dominion over them. When Agamemnon, in Homer, offers to Achilles G.ed.p718
for his friendship the sovereignty of seven Greek cities, the sole advant-
age which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was that the people
wouldhonourhimwithpresents. Aslongassuchpresents, aslongasthe
emolumentsofjustice,orwhatmaybecalledthefeesofcourt,constituted
in this manner the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived
from his sovereignty, it could not well be expected, it could not even de-
cently be proposed, that he should give them up altogether. It might, and
it frequently was proposed, that he should regulate and ascertain them.
Butaftertheyhadbeensoregulatedandascertained,howtohinderaper-
son who was all-powerful from extending them beyond those regulations
was still very difficult, not to say impossible. During the continuance of
thisstateofthings,therefore,thecorruptionofjustice,naturallyresulting
fromthearbitraryanduncertainnatureofthosepresents,scarceadmitted
ofanyeffectualremedy.
1567 [17] But when from different causes, chiefly from the continually increas-
ingexpensesofdefendingthenationagainsttheinvasionofothernations,
the private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for
defraying the expense of the sovereignty, and when it had become neces-
sarythatthepeopleshould,fortheirownsecurity,contributetowardsthis
555 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
expense by taxes of different kinds, it seems to have been very commonly
stipulated that no present for the administration of justice should, under
anypretence,beacceptedeitherbythesovereign,orbyhisbailiffsandsub-
stitutes,thejudges. Thosepresents,itseemstohavebeensupposed,could
more easily be abolished altogether than effectually regulated and ascer-
tained. Fixedsalarieswereappointedtothejudges,whichweresupposed
to compensate to them the loss of whatever might have been their share
oftheancientemolumentsofjustice,asthetaxesmorethancompensated
to the sovereign the loss of his. Justice was then said to be administered
gratis.
1568 [18] Justice,however,neverwasinrealityadministeredgratisinanycoun-
try. Lawyers and attorneys, at least, must always be paid by the parties;
and, if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than
they actually perform it. The fees annually paid to lawyers and attor-
neys amount, in every court, to a much greater sum than the salaries of
the judges. The circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown
can nowhere much diminish the necessary expense of a law-suit. But it
was not so much to diminish the expense, as to prevent the corruption of G.ed.p719
justice, that the judges were prohibited from receiving any present or fee
fromtheparties.
1569 [19] The office of judge is in itself so very honourable that men are willing
to accept of it, though accompanied with very small emoluments. The in-
feriorofficeofjusticeofpeace,thoughattendedwithagooddealoftrouble,
and in most cases with no emoluments at all, is an object of ambition to
thegreaterpartofourcountrygentlemen. Thesalariesofallthedifferent

tionandexecutionofjustice,evenwhereitisnotmanagedwithverygood

wheretheyarepaidallatonce,atacertainperiodofeveryprocess,intothe
hands of a cashier or receiver, to be by him distributed in certain known
proportions among the different judges after the process is decided, and
not till it is decided, there seems to be no more danger of corruption than
wheresuchfeesareprohibitedaltogether. Thosefees,withoutoccasioning
any considerable increase in the expense of a lawsuit, might be rendered
556 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
fully sufficient for defraying the whole expense of justice. By not being
paid to the judges till the process was determined, they might be some
incitement to the diligence of the court in examining and deciding it. In
courts which consisted of a considerable number of judges, by proportion-
ingtheshareofeachjudgetothenumberofhoursanddayswhichhehad
employed in examining the process, either in the court or in a committee
by order of the court, those fees might give some encouragement to the
diligence of each particular judge. Public services are never better per-
formed than when their reward comes only in consequence of their being
performed, and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing
them. In the different parliaments of France, the fees of court (called epi- G.ed.p720
cesandvacations)constitutethefargreaterpartoftheemolumentsofthe
judges. After all deductions are made, the net salary paid by the crown

monfootman. Thedistributionofthoseepices,too,isaccordingtothedili-
genceofthejudges. Adiligentjudgegainsacomfortable,thoughmoderate,
revenue by his office: an idle one gets little more than his salary. Those
Parliaments are perhaps, in many respects, not very convenient courts of
justice; but they have never been accused, they seem never even to have
beensuspected,ofcorruption.
1571 [21] The fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of
thedifferentcourtsofjusticeinEngland. Eachcourtendeavouredtodraw
toitselfasmuchbusinessasitcould, andwas, uponthataccount, willing
to take cognisance of many suits which were not originally intended to
fall under its jurisdiction. The Court of King’s Bench, instituted for the
trial of criminal causes only, took cognisance of civil suits; the plaintiff
pretendingthatthedefendant,innotdoinghimjustice,hadbeenguiltyof
sometrespassormisdemeanour. TheCourtofExchequer,institutedforthe

only as were due to the king, took cognisance of all other contract debts;

todependaltogetheruponthepartiesbeforewhatcourttheywouldchoose
tohavetheircausetried;andeachcourtendeavoured,bysuperiordispatch
andimpartiality,todrawtoitselfasmanycausesasitcould. Thepresent
admirable constitution of the courts of justice in England was, perhaps,
originally in a great measure formed by this emulation which anciently
took place between their respective judges; each judge endeavouring to
give, in his own court, the speediest and most effectual remedy which the
law would admit for every sort of injustice. Originally the courts of law
gave damages only for breach of contract. The Court of Chancery, as a
courtofconscience,firsttookuponittoenforcethespecificperformanceof
557 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
agreements. Whenthebreachofcontractconsistedinthenon-paymentof
money, the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than
byorderingpayment,whichwasequivalenttoaspecificperformanceofthe
agreement. In such cases, therefore, the remedy of the courts of law was
sufficient. Itwasnotsoinothers. Whenthetenantsuedhislordforhaving G.ed.p721
unjustly outed him of his lease, the damages which he recovered were by
nomeansequivalenttothepossessionoftheland. Suchcauses,therefore,
for some time, went all to the Court of Chancery, to the no small loss of
the courts of law. It was to draw back such causes to themselves that the
courts of law are said to have invented the artificial and fictitious Writ of
Ejectment,themosteffectualremedyforanunjustouterordispossession
ofland.
1572 [22] A stamp-duty upon the law proceedings of each particular court, to be
levied by that court, and applied towards the maintenance of the judges
and other officers belonging to it, might, in the same manner, afford rev-
enue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of justice,
withoutbringinganyburdenuponthegeneralrevenueofthesociety. The
judges indeed might, in this case, be under the temptation of multiplying
unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause, in order to increase, as
much as possible, the produce of such a stamp-duty. It has been the cus-
tom in modern Europe to regulate, upon most occasions, the payment of
the attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of pages which
they had occasion to write; the court, however, requiring that each page
should contain so many lines, and each line so many words. In order to
increase their payment, the attorneys and clerks have contrived to mul-
tiplywordsbeyondallnecessity,tothecorruptionofthelawlanguageof,I
believe,everycourtofjusticeinEurope. Aliketemptationmightperhaps
occasionalikecorruptionintheformoflawproceedings.
1573 [23] But whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray
itsownexpense,orwhetherthejudgesbemaintainedbyfixedsalariespaid
tothemfromsomeotherfund,itdoesnotseemnecessarythattheperson
orpersonsentrustedwiththeexecutivepowershouldbechargedwiththe
management of that fund, or with the payment of those salaries. That

of the salary of the judges of the Court of Session in Scotland arises from G.ed.p722
the interest of a sum of money. The necessary instability of such a fund
seems, however, to render it an improper one for the maintenance of an
institutionwhichoughttolastforever.
1574 [24] Theseparationofthejudicialfromtheexecutivepowerseemsoriginally
to have arisen from the increasing business of the society, in consequence
ofitsincreasingimprovement. Theadministrationofjusticebecamesola-
558 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
boriousandsocomplicatedadutyastorequiretheundividedattentionof
the persons to whom it was entrusted. The person entrusted with the ex-
ecutivepowernothavingleisuretoattendtothedecisionofprivatecauses
himself, a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead. In the pro-
gress of the Roman greatness, the consul was too much occupied with the
political affairs of the state to attend to the administration of justice. A
praetor,therefore,wasappointedtoadministeritinhisstead. Inthepro-
gress of the European monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of
theRomanempire,thesovereignsandthegreatlordscameuniversallyto
consider the administration of justice as an office both too laborious and
too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons. They universally,
therefore, discharged themselves of it by appointing a deputy, bailiff, or
judge.
1575 [25] Whenthejudicialisunitedtotheexecutivepower,itisscarcepossible
that justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly called
polities. The persons entrusted with the great interests of the state may,
even without any corrupt views, sometimes imagine it necessary to sacri-

PART THIRD
Of the Expense of Public Works and Public
Institutions
1576 [1] Thethirdandlastdutyofthesovereignorcommonwealthisthatoferect-
ing and maintaining those public institutions and those public works,
which, thoughtheymay beinthehighest degree advantageous toagreat
society, are, however, of such a nature that the profit could never repay

thereforecannotbeexpectedthatanyindividualorsmallnumberofindi-

too,verydifferentdegreesofexpenseinthedifferentperiodsofsociety.

twokinds: thosefortheeducationofyouth,andthosefortheinstructionof

ofthosedifferentsortsofpublic,worksandinstitutionsmaybemostprop-
erly defrayed will divide this third part of the present chapter into three
differentarticles.

commerce of any country, such as good roads, bridges, navigable canals,
harbours,etc.,mustrequireverydifferentdegreesofexpenseinthediffer-
entperiodsofsocietyisevidentwithoutanyproof. Theexpenseofmaking
and maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently increase
with the annual produce of the land and labour of that country, or with
the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to fetch
andcarryuponthoseroads. Thestrengthofabridgemustbesuitedtothe

depthandthesupplyofwaterforanavigablecanalmustbeproportioned
to the number and tonnage of the lighters which are likely to carry goods
upon it; the extent of a harbour to the number of the shipping which are
likelytotakeshelterinit.
1579 [2] It does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works
should be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly called, of
which the collection and application is in most countries assigned to the
executive power. The greater part of such public works may easily be so
managed as to afford a particular revenue sufficient for defraying their
own expense, without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of
thesociety.
1580 [3] Ahighway,abridge,anavigablecanal,forexample,mayinmostcases
be both made and maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which
make use of them: a harbour, by a moderate port-duty upon the tonnage
of the shipping which load or unload in it. The coinage, another institu-
tionforfacilitatingcommerce,inmanycountries,notonlydefraysitsown

expense, but affords a small revenue or seignorage to the sovereign. The
post-office, another institution for the same purpose, over and above de-
frayingitsownexpense,affordsinalmostallcountriesaveryconsiderable
revenuetothesovereign.
1581 [4] When the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the
lighters which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to their
weight or their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those public
works exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of G.ed.p725
them. Itseemsscarcepossibletoinventamoreequitablewayofmaintain-
ing such works. This tax or toll too, though it is advanced by the carrier,
isfinallypaidbytheconsumer,towhomitmustalwaysbechargedinthe
price of the goods. As the expense of carriage, however, is very much re-
duced by means of such public works, the goods, notwithstanding the toll
come cheaper to the consumer than the; could otherwise have done; their
pricenotbeingsomuchraisedbythetollasitisloweredbythecheapness
of the carriage. The person who finally pays this tax, therefore, gains by
the application more than he loses by the payment of it. His payment is
exactly in proportion to his gain. It is in reality no more than a part of
that gain which he is obliged to give up in order to get the rest. It seems
impossibletoimagineamoreequitablemethodofraisingatax.
1582 [5] Whenthetolluponcarriagesofluxuryuponcoaches,post-chaises,etc.,
ismadesomewhathigherinproportiontotheirweightthanuponcarriages
of necessary use, such as carts, waggons, etc., the indolence and vanity of
the rich is made to contribute in a very easy manner to the relief of the
poor, by rendering cheaper the transportation of heavy goods to all the
differentpartsofthecountry.
1583 [6] When high roads, bridges, canals, etc., are in this manner made and
supported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them, they
can be made only where that commerce requires them, and consequently
where it is proper to make them. Their expenses too, their grandeur and
magnificence, must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay.
They must be made consequently as it is proper to make them. A magni-
ficent high road cannot be made through a desert country where there is
little or no commerce, or merely because it happens to lead to the coun-
try villa of the intendant of the province, or to that of some great lord to
whom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court. A great bridge
cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes, or merely
to embellish the view from the windows of a neighbouring palace: things
whichsometimeshappenincountrieswhereworksofthiskindarecarried
on by any other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of
affording.
1584 [7] In several different parts of Europe the ton or lock-duty upon a canal
is the property of private persons, whose private interest obliges them to
keep up the canal. If it is not kept in tolerable order, the navigation ne-
cessarily ceases altogether, and along with it the whole profit which they
561 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
can make by the tolls. If those tolls were put under the management of G.ed.p726
commissioners, who had themselves no interest in them, they might be
lessattentivetothemaintenanceoftheworkswhichproducedthem. The
canal of Languedoc cost the King of France and the province upwards of
thirteenmillionsoflivres,which(attwenty-eightlivresthemarkofsilver,
thevalueofFrenchmoneyintheendofthelastcentury)amountedtoup-
wards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling. When that great work
was finished, the most likely method, it was found, of keeping it in con-
stantrepairwastomakeapresentofthetollstoRiquettheengineer,who
planned and conducted the work. Those tolls constitute at present a very
largeestatetothedifferentbranchesofthefamilyofthatgentleman,who
have, therefore, a great interest to keep the work in constant repair. But
hadthosetollsbeenputunderthemanagementofcommissioners,whohad
no such interest, they might perhaps have been dissipated in ornamental
andunnecessaryexpenses,whilethemostessentialpartsoftheworkwere
allowedtogotoruin.
1585 [8] The tolls for the maintenance of a high road cannot with any safety
be made the property of private persons. A high road, though entirely
neglected, does not become altogether impassable, though a canal does.
Theproprietorsofthetollsuponahighroad,therefore,mightneglectalto-
gethertherepairoftheroad,andyetcontinuetolevyverynearlythesame
tolls. It is proper, therefore, that the tolls for the maintenance of such a
workshouldbeputunderthemanagementofcommissionersortrustees.
1586 [9] InGreatBritain,theabuseswhichthetrusteeshavecommittedinthe
managementofthosetollshaveinmanycasesbeenveryjustlycomplained
of. At many turnpikes, it has been said, the money levied is more than
double of what is necessary for executing, in the completest manner, the
workwhichisoftenexecutedinveryslovenlymanner,andsometimesnot
executed at all. The system of repairing the high roads by tolls of this
kind, it must be observed, is not of very long standing. We should not
wonder,therefore,ifithasnotyetbeenbroughttothatdegreeofperfection
of which it seems capable. If mean and improper persons are frequently

towhatisbarelysufficientforexecutingtheworktobedonebythem,the
recencyoftheinstitutionbothaccountsandapologizesforthosedefects,of
which, by the wisdom of Parliament, the greater part may in due time be
graduallyremedied.
1587 [10] The money levied at the different turnpikes in Great Britain is sup-
posed to exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads, that G.ed.p727
the savings, which, with proper economy, might be made from it, have
been considered, even by some ministers, as a very great resource which
might at some time or another be applied to the exigencies of the state.
Government,ithasbeensaid,bytakingthemanagementoftheturnpikes
into its own hands, and by employing the soldiers, who would work for
562 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a very small addition to their pay, could keep the roads in good order at
a much less expense than it can be done by trustees, who have no other
workmen to employ but such as derive their whole subsistence from their
wages. A great revenue, half a million perhaps2, it has been pretended,
might in this manner be gained without laying any new burden upon the
people;andtheturnpikeroadsmightbemadetocontributetothegeneral

1588 [11] ThataconsiderablerevenuemightbegainedinthismannerIhaveno
doubt,thoughprobablynotnearsomuchastheprojectorsofthisplanhave
supposed. Theplanitself,however,seemsliabletoseveralveryimportant
objections.
1589 [12] First, if the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be con-
sidered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the state,
they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed to
require. According to the policy of Great Britain, therefore, they would
probablybeaugmentedveryfast. Thefacilitywithwhichagreatrevenue
couldbedrawnfromthemwouldprobablyencourageadministrationtore-
curveryfrequentlytothisresource. Thoughitmay,perhaps,bemorethan
doubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of the
present tolls, it can scarce be doubted but that a million might be saved
out of them if they were doubled: and perhaps two millions if they were
tripled3. Thisgreatrevenue,too,mightbeleviedwithouttheappointment
ofasinglenewofficertocollectandreceiveit. Buttheturnpiketollsbeing
continually augmented in this manner, instead of facilitating the inland
commerceofthecountryasatpresent,wouldsoonbecomeaverygreatin-
cumbranceuponit. Theexpenseoftransportingallheavygoodsfromone
part of the country to another would soon be so much increased, the mar-
ketforallsuchgoods,consequently,wouldsoonbesomuchnarrowed,that G.ed.p728
their production would be in a great measure discouraged, and the most
important branches of the domestic industry of the country annihilated
altogether.
1590 [13] Secondly, a tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight, though a
veryequaltaxwhenappliedtothesolepurposeofrepairingtheroads,isa
veryunequalonewhenappliedtoanyotherpurpose,ortosupplythecom-
mon exigencies of the state. When it is applied to the sole purpose above
mentioned,eachcarriageissupposedtopayexactlyforthewearandtear
which that carriage occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to any
other purpose, each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that wear
andtear,andcontributestothesupplyofsomeotherexigencyofthestate.

3[Smith]Ihavenowgoodreasonstobelievethatalltheseconjecturalsumsarebymuch

563 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to their
weight,andnottotheirvalue,itischieflypaidbytheconsumersofcoarse
and bulky, not by those of precious and light, commodities. Whatever ex-
igency of the state therefore this tax might be intended to supply, that
exigencywouldbechieflysuppliedattheexpenseofthepoor,nottherich;
attheexpenseofthosewhoareleastabletosupplyit,notofthosewhoare
mostable.
1591 [14] Thirdly,ifgovernmentshouldatanytimeneglectthereparationofthe
high roads, it would be still more difficult than it is at present to compel
the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls. A large revenue
might thus be levied upon the people without any part of it being applied
to the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought ever
to be applied. If the meanness and poverty of the trustees of turnpike
roadsrenderitsometimesdifficultatpresenttoobligethemtorepairtheir
wrong,theirwealthandgreatnesswouldrenderittentimesmoresointhe
casewhichisheresupposed.
1592 [15] In France, the funds destined for the reparation of high roads are un-
der the immediate direction of the executive power. Those funds consist
partly in a certain number of days’ labour which the country people are
in most parts of Europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways,
andpartlyinsuchaportionofthegeneralrevenueofthestateastheking
choosestosparefromhisotherexpenses.
1593 [16] By the ancient law of France, as well as by that of most other parts of
Europe,thelabourofthecountrypeoplewasunderthedirectionofalocal
or provincial magistracy, which had no immediate dependency upon the
king’s council. But by the present practice both the labour of the people,
and whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for the repara- G.ed.p729
tionofthehighroadsinanyparticularprovinceorgenerality,areentirely
under the management of the intendant; an officer who is appointed and
removed by the king’s council, and who receives his orders from it, and is
in constant correspondence with it. In the progress of despotism the au-
thorityoftheexecutivepowergraduallyabsorbsthatofeveryotherpower
inthestate,andassumestoitselfthemanagementofeverybranchofrev-
enue which is destined for any public purpose. In France, however, the
great post-roads, the roads which make the communication between the
principal towns of the kingdom, are in general kept in good order, and in
some provinces are even a good deal superior to the greater part of the
turnpike roads of England. But what we call the cross-roads, that is, the
far greater part of the roads in the country, are entirely neglected, and
areinmanyplacesabsolutelyimpassableforanyheavycarriage. Insome
placesitisevendangeroustotravelonhorseback,andmulesaretheonly

and magnificence, such as a great highway, which is frequently seen by
theprincipalnobility,whoseapplausesnotonlyflatterhisvanity,buteven
564 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
contribute to support his interest at court. But to execute a great num-
ber oflittle works, in which nothing that can bedone canmake anygreat
appearance, or excite the smallest degree of admiration in any traveller,
and which, in short, have nothing to recommend them but their extreme
utility, is a business which appears in every respect too mean and paltry
tomerittheattentionofsogreatamagistrate. Undersuchanadministra-
tion,therefore,suchworksarealmostalwaysentirelyneglected.
1594 [17] In China, and in several other governments of Asia, the executive
power charges itself both with the reparation of the high roads and with
the maintenance of the navigable canals. In the instructions which are
given to the governor of each province, those objects, it is said, are con-
stantly recommended to him, and the judgment which the court forms of
his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to
have paid to this part of his instructions. This branch of public police ac-
cordingly is said to be very much attended to in all those countries, but
particularly in China, where the high roads, and still more the navig-
ablecanals,itispretended,exceedverymucheverythingofthesamekind
which is known in Europe. The accounts of those works, however, which
have been transmitted to Europe, have generally been drawn up by weak
and wondering travellers; frequently by stupid and lying missionaries. If
they had been examined by more intelligent eyes, and if the accounts of
them had been reported by more faithful witnesses, they would not, per- G.ed.p730
haps,appeartobesowonderful. TheaccountwhichBerniergivesofsome
works of this kind in Indostan falls very much short of what had been re-
ported of them by other travellers, more disposed to the marvellous than
hewas. Itmaytoo,perhaps,beinthosecountries,asinFrance,wherethe
great roads, the great communications which are likely to be the subjects
ofconversationatthecourtandinthecapital,areattendedto,andallthe
restneglected. InChina,besides,inIndostan,andinseveralothergovern-
ments of Asia, the revenue of the sovereign arises almost altogether from
a land tax or land rent, which rises or falls with the rise and fall of the
annualproduceoftheland. Thegreatinterestofthesovereign,therefore,
his revenue, is in such countries necessarily and immediately connected
with the cultivation of the land, with the greatness of its produce, and
with the value of its produce. But in order to render that produce both
as great and as valuable as possible, it is necessary to procure to it as ex-
tensiveamarketaspossible,andconsequentlytoestablishthefreest,the
easiest, and the least expensive communication between all the different
parts of the country; which can be done only by means of the best roads
and the best navigable canals. But the revenue of the sovereign does not,
inanypartofEurope,arisechieflyfromalandtaxorlandrent. Inallthe
great kingdoms of Europe, perhaps, the greater part of it may ultimately
dependupontheproduceoftheland: butthatdependencyisneithersoim-
mediate, nor so evident. In Europe, therefore, the sovereign does not feel
himself so directly called upon to promote the increase, both in quantity
565 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
and value, of the produce of the land, or, by maintaining good roads and
canals, to provide the most extensive market for that produce. Though it
should be true, therefore, what I apprehend is not a little doubtful, that
insomepartsofAsiathisdepartmentofthepublicpoliceisveryproperly
managed by the executive power, there is not the least probability that,
during the present state of things, it could be tolerably managed by that
powerinanypartofEurope.
1595 [18] Even those public works which are of such a nature that they cannot
afford any revenue for maintaining themselves, but of which the conveni-
encyisnearlyconfinedtosomeparticularplaceordistrict,arealwaysbet-
ter maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management
ofalocalorprovincialadministration, thanbythegeneralrevenueofthe
state, of which the executive power must always have the management.
Were the streets of London to be lighted and paved at the expense of the
treasury, is there any probability that they would be so well lighted and G.ed.p731
pavedastheyareatpresent,orevenatsosmallanexpense? Theexpense,
besides,insteadofbeingraisedbyalocaltaxupontheinhabitantsofeach
particular street, parish, or district in London, would, in this case, be de-
frayed out of the general revenue of the state, and would consequently
be raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom, of whom the
greater part derive no sort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the
streetsofLondon.
1596 [19] Theabuseswhichsometimescreepintothelocalandprovincialadmin-
istrationofalocalandprovincialrevenue,howenormoussoevertheymay
appear, are in reality, however, almost always very trifling in comparison
of those which commonly take place in the administration and expendit-
ureoftherevenueofagreatempire. Theyare, besides, muchmoreeasily
corrected. Under the local or provincial administration of the justices of
the peace in Great Britain, the six days’ labour which the country people
areobligedtogivetothereparationofthehighwaysisnotalwaysperhaps
very judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever exacted with any circum-
stances of cruelty or oppression. In France, under the administration of
theintendants,theapplicationisnotalwaysmorejudicious,andtheexac-
tionisfrequentlythemostcruelandoppressive. SuchCorvees,astheyare
called, make one of the principal instruments of tyranny by which those
officerschastiseanyparishorcommunautewhichhashadthemisfortune

OfthePublicWorksandInstitutionswhicharenecessary

1597 [1] The object of the public works and institutions above mentioned is to fa-
cilitate commerce in general. But in order to facilitate some particular
566 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
branchesofit,particularinstitutionsarenecessary,whichagainrequirea
particularandextraordinaryexpense.
1598 [2] Someparticularbranchesofcommerce, whicharecarriedonwithbar-
barous and uncivilised nations, require extraordinary protection. An or-
dinarystoreorcounting-housecouldgivelittlesecuritytothegoodsofthe
merchants who trade to the western coast of Africa. To defend them from

ofIndostanhavebeensupposedtorenderalikeprecautionnecessaryeven
among that mild and gentle people; and it was under pretence of secur-
ing their persons and property from violence that both the English and
French East India Companies were allowed to erect the first forts which
theypossessedinthatcountry. Amongothernations,whosevigorousgov-
ernmentwillsuffernostrangerstopossessanyfortifiedplacewithintheir
territory, it may be necessary to maintain some ambassador, minister, or
counsel, who may both decide, according to their own customs, the differ-
ences arising among his own countrymen, and, in their disputes with the
natives,may,bymeansofhispubliccharacter,interferewithmoreauthor-
ity, and afford them a more powerful protection, than they could expect
fromanyprivateman. Theinterestsofcommercehavefrequentlymadeit
necessary to maintain ministers in foreign countries where the purposes,
either of war or alliance, would not have required any. The commerce of
theTurkeyCompanyfirstoccasionedtheestablishmentofanordinaryam-
bassador at Constantinople. The first English embassies to Russia arose
altogether from commercial interests. The constant interference which
those interests necessarily occasioned between the subjects of the differ-
ent states of Europe, has probably introduced the custom of keeping, in
all neighbouring countries, ambassadors or ministers constantly resident
even in the time of peace. This custom, unknown to ancient times, seems
not to be older than the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth
century;thatis,thanthetimewhencommercefirstbegantoextenditself
to the greater part of the nations of Europe, and when they first began to
attendtoitsinterests.
1599 [3] It seems not unreasonable that the extraordinary expense which the
protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion should be
defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch; by a moderate
fine,forexample,tobepaidbythetraderswhentheyfirstenterintoit,or,

which they either import into, or export out of, the particular countries

itshouldseemequallyreasonabletolayaparticulartaxuponaparticular

1600 [4] Theprotectionoftradeingeneralhasalwaysbeenconsideredasessen- G.ed.p733
tialtothedefenceofthecommonwealth, and, uponthataccount, aneces-
sarypartofthedutyoftheexecutivepower. Thecollectionandapplication
of the general duties of customs, therefore, have always been left to that
power. Buttheprotectionofanyparticularbranchoftradeisapartofthe
general protection of trade; a part, therefore, of the duty of that power;
and if nations always acted consistently, the particular duties levied for
the purposes of such particular protection should always have been left
equally to its disposal. But in this respect, as well as in many others, na-
tions have not always acted consistently; and in the greater part of the
commercialstatesofEurope,particularcompaniesofmerchantshavehad
theaddresstopersuadethelegislaturetoentrusttothemtheperformance
ofthispartofthedutyofthesovereign,togetherwithallthepowerswhich
arenecessarilyconnectedwithit.
1601 [5] These companies, though they may, perhaps, have been useful for the
first introduction of some branches of commerce, by making, at their own
expense, an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to
make,haveinthelongrunproved,universally,eitherburdensomeoruse-
less,andhaveeithermismanagedorconfinedthetrade.
1602 [6] Whenthosecompaniesdonottradeuponajointstock, butareobliged
to admit any person, properly qualified, upon paying a certain fine, and
agreeing to submit to the regulations of the company, each member trad-
ing upon his own stock, and at his own risk, they are called regulated
companies. When they trade upon a joint stock, each member sharing in
thecommonprofitorlossinproportiontohisshareinthisstock,theyare
called joint stock companies. Such companies, whether regulated or joint
stock,sometimeshave,andsometimeshavenot,exclusiveprivileges.
1603 [7] Regulated companies resemble, in every respect, the corporations of
trades so common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of
Europe, and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind. As no
inhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade without first ob-
taining his freedom in the corporation, so in most cases no subject of the
state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade, for which a reg-
ulated company is established, without first becoming a member of that
company. The monopoly is more or less strict according as the terms of
admission are more or less difficult; and according as the directors of the
companyhavemoreorlessauthority,orhaveitmoreorlessintheirpower G.ed.p734
to manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the trade
to themselves and their particular friends. In the most ancient regulated
companies the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in other cor-
porations, and entitled the person who had served his time to a member
of the company to become himself a member, either without paying any
fine, or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other
568 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
people. The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain
it, prevails in all regulated companies. When they have been allowed to
actaccordingtotheirnaturalgenius,theyhavealways,inordertoconfine
the competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured
to subject the trade to many burden some regulations. When the law has
restrainedthemfromdoingthis,theyhavebecomealtogetheruselessand
insignificant.
1604 [8] The regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present sub-
sistinGreatBritainaretheancientmerchantadventurers’company,now
commonly called the Hamburg Company, the Russia Company, the East-
landCompany,theTurkeyCompany,andtheAfricanCompany.
1605 [9] ThetermsofadmissionintotheHamburgCompanyarenowsaidtobe
quite easy, and the directors either have it not their power to subject the
trade to any burdensome restraint or regulations, or, at least, have not of
late exercised that power. It has not always been so. About the middle of

thosecomplaintsproducedanActofParliament,theyhadprobablyintim-
idatedthecompanysofarastoobligethemtoreformtheirconduct. Since
thattime,atleast,therehasbeennocomplaintsagainstthem. Bythe10th
and 11th of William III. c.6, the fine for admission into the Russia Com-
pany was reduced to five pounds; and by the 25th of Charles II. c.7, that G.ed.p735

sametime,Sweden,Denmark,andNorway,allthecountriesonthenorth

ment. Before that time, Sir Josiah Child had represented both these and

managementthelowstateofthetradewhichweatthattimecarriedonto
the countries comprehended within their respective charters. But though
suchcompaniesmaynot,inthepresenttimes,beveryoppressive,theyare
certainly altogether useless. To be merely useless, indeed, is perhaps the
highest eulogy which can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated com-
pany;andallthethreecompaniesabovementionedseem,intheirpresent
state,todeservethiseulogy.
1606 [10] ThefineforadmissionintotheTurkeyCompanywasformerlytwenty-
fivepoundsforallpersonsundertwenty-sixyearsofage,andfiftypounds
for all persons above that age. Nobody but mere merchants could be ad-
mitted; a restriction which excluded all shopkeepers and retailers. By a
bye-law, no British manufactures could be exported to Turkey but in the
general ships of the company; and as those ships sailed always from the
port of London, this restriction confined the trade to that expensive port,
569 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
andthetraderstothosewholivedinLondonandinitsneighbourhood. By
another bye-law, no person living within twenty miles of London, and not
free of the city, could be admitted a member; another restriction which,
joined to the foregoing, necessarily excluded all but the freemen of Lon-
don. As the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships de-
pendedaltogetheruponthedirectors,theycouldeasilyfillthemwiththeir
own goods and those of their particular friends, to the exclusion of oth-
ers, who, they might pretend, had made their proposals too late. In this
state of things, therefore, this company was in every respect a strict and
oppressive monopoly. Those abuses gave occasion to the act of the 26th of
George II, c. 18, reducing the fine for admission to twenty pounds for all
persons,withoutanydistinctionofages,oranyrestriction,eithertomere
merchants, or to the freemen of London; and granting to all such persons
the liberty of exporting, from all the ports of Great Britain to any port
in Turkey, all British goods of which the exportation was not prohibited;
and of importing from thence all Turkish goods of which the importation
was not prohibited, upon paying both the general duties of customs, and
theparticulardutiesassessedfordefrayingthenecessaryexpensesofthe G.ed.p736

was by the same act ordained, that if any seven members of the company
conceived themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which should be enacted
after the passing of this act, they might appeal to the Board of Trade and
Plantations(totheauthorityofwhichacommitteeofthePrivyCouncilhas
now succeeded), provided such appeal was brought within twelve months
after the bye-law was enacted; and that if any seven members conceived
themselves aggrieved by any bye-law which had been enacted before the
passing of this act, they might bring a like appeal, provided it was within
twelvemonthsafterthedayonwhichthisactwastotakeplace. Theexper-
ience of one year, however, may not always be sufficient to discover to all
the members of a great company, the pernicious tendency of a particular
bye-law; and if several of them should afterwards discover it, neither the
BoardofTrade,northecommitteeofcouncil,canaffordthemanyredress.
Theobject,besides,ofthegreaterpartofthebye-lawsofallregulatedcom-
panies,aswellasofallothercorporations,isnotsomuchtooppressthose

maybedone,notonlybyahighfine,butbymanyothercontrivances. The
constant view of such companies is always to raise the rate of their own
profit as high as they can; to keep the market, both for the goods which
they export, and for those which they import, as much understocked as
they can: which can be done only by restraining the competition, or by
discouraging new adventurers from entering into the trade. A fine even
of twenty pounds, besides, though it may not perhaps be sufficient to dis-
courageanymanfromenteringintotheTurkeytradewithanintentionto
570 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
continue in it, may be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from
hazarding a single adventure in it. In all trades, the regular established
traders, even though not incorporated, naturally combine to raise profits,
which are noway so likely to be kept, at all times, down to their proper
level, as by the occasional competition of speculative adventure. The Tur-
key trade, though in some measure laid open by this Act of Parliament,
is still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free.
The Turkey Company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or
threeconsuls,who,likeotherpublicministers,oughttobemaintainedal-
togetherbythestate,andthetradelaidopentoallhisMajesty’ssubjects.
The different taxes levied by the company, for this and other corporation

which they may frequently employ, with propriety, in building, repairing,

1608 [12] Long after the time of Sir Josiah Child, however, in 1750, a regulated
571 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
company was established, the present company of merchants trading to
Africa, which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all
the British forts and garrisons that lie between Cape Blanc and the Cape
of Good Hope, and afterwards with that of those only which lie between
Cape Rouge and the Cape of Good Hope. The act which establishes this
company(the23rdofGeorgeII,c.3)seemstohavehadtwodistinctobjects

which is natural to the directors of a regulated company; and secondly, to
forcethem,asmuchaspossible,togiveanattention,whichisnotnatural
tothem,towardsthemaintenanceoffortsandgarrisons.
1609 [13] Forthefirstofthesepurposesthefineforadmissionislimitedtoforty
shillings. The company is prohibited from trading in their corporate ca-
pacity, or upon a joint stock; from borrowing money upon common seal,
or from laying any restraints upon the trade which may be carried on
freely from all places, and by all persons being British subjects, and pay-
ing the fine. The government is in a committee of nine persons who meet
at London, but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company
at London, Bristol, and Liverpool; three from each place. No committee-
man can be continued in office for more than three years together. Any
committee-manmightberemovedbytheBoardofTradeandPlantations,
nowbyacommitteecouncil,afterbeingheardinhisowndefence. Thecom-
mittee are forbid to export negroes from Africa, or to import any African
goods into Great Britain. But as they are charged with the maintenance
of forts and garrisons, they may, for that purpose, export from Great Bri-
taintoAfricagoodsandstoresofdifferentkinds. Outofthemonieswhich
theyshallreceivefromthecompany,theyareallowedasumnotexceeding
eight hundred pounds for the salaries of their clerks and agents at Lon-
don, Bristol, and Liverpool, the house rent of their office at London, and
all other expenses of management, commission, and agency in England.
What remains of this sum, after defraying these different expenses, they
may divide among themselves, as compensation for their trouble, in what
mannertheythinkproper. Bythisconstitution,itmighthavebeenexpec-
tedthatthespiritofmonopolywouldhavebeeneffectuallyrestrained,and
the first of these purposes sufficiently answered. It would seem, however,
thatithadnot. Thoughbythe4thofGeorgeIII,c.20,thefortofSenegal,
with all its dependencies, had been vested in the company of merchants
trading to Africa, yet in the year following (by the 5th of George III, c.44)
notonlySenegalanditsdependencies,butthewholecoastfromtheportof
Sallee, in south Barbary, to Cape Rouge, was exempted from the jurisdic-
tionofthatcompany,wasvestedinthecrown,andthetradetoitdeclared
free to all his Majesty’s subjects. The company had been suspected of re-
straining the trade, and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly.
It is not, however, very easy to conceive how, under the regulations of the
23rdofGeorgeII,theycoulddoso. IntheprinteddebatesoftheHouseof

that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the consignments
andcommissionsoftheformerwhichwouldestablisharealmonopoly.
1610 [14] Forthesecondofthese,purposes,themaintenanceofthefortsandgar-
risons,anannualsumhasbeenallottedtothembyParliament,generally
about 13,000l.. For the proper application of this sum, the committee is
obligedtoaccountannuallytotheCursitorBaronofExchequer;whichac-
count is afterwards to be laid before Parliament. But Parliament, which
gives so little attention to the application of millions, is not likely to give
muchtothatof13,000l.ayear;andtheCursitorBaronofExchequer,from
his profession and education, is not likely to be profoundly skilled in the
proper expense of forts and garrisons. The captains of his Majesty’s navy,
indeed, or any other commissioned officers appointed by the Board of Ad-
miralty, may inquire into the condition of the forts and garrisons, and re-
port their observations to that board. But that board seems to have no
direct jurisdiction over the committee, nor any authority to correct those
whose conduct it may thus inquire into; and the captains of his Majesty’s
navy,besides,arenotsupposedtobealwaysdeeplylearnedinthescience
of fortification. Removal from an office which can be enjoyed only for the
termofthreeyears,andofwhichthelawfulemoluments,evenduringthat
term, aresoverysmall, seemstobetheutmostpunishmenttowhichany
committee-man is liable for any fault, except direct malversation, or em-
bezzlement,eitherofthepublicmoney,orofthatofthecompany; andthe
fearofthatpunishmentcanneverbeamotiveofsufficientweighttoforce
a continual and careful attention to a business to which he has no other
interest to attend. The committee are accused of having sent out bricks
and stones from England for the reparation of Cape Coast Castle on the
coast of Guinea, a business for which Parliament had several times gran-
ted an extraordinary sum of money. These bricks and stones too, which
hadthusbeensentuponsolongavoyage,weresaidtohavebeenofsobad
a quality that it was necessary to rebuild from the foundation the walls
which had been repaired with them. The forts and garrisons which lie
north of Cape Rouge are not only maintained at the expense of the state,
butareundertheimmediategovernmentoftheexecutivepower;andwhy
those which lie south of that Cape, and which are, in part at least, main-
tainedattheexpenseofthestate,shouldbeunderadifferentgovernment,
it seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason. The protection of
the Mediterranean trade was the original purpose of pretence of the gar-
risonsofGibraltarandMinorca, andthemaintenanceandgovernmentof G.ed.p740
thosegarrisonshasalwaysbeen,veryproperly,committed,nottotheTur-
key Company, but to the executive power. In the extent of its dominion
consists, in a great measure, the pride and dignity of that power; and it
is not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary for the defence
573 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of that dominion. The garrisons at Gibraltar and Minorca, accordingly,
have never been neglected; though Minorca has been twice taken, and is
now probably lost for ever, that disaster was never even imputed to any
neglect in the executive power. I would not, however, be understood to
insinuate that either of those expensive garrisons was ever, even in the
smallest degree, necessary for the purpose for which they were originally
dismemberedfromtheSpanishmonarchy. Thatdismemberment,perhaps,

1611 [15] Joint stock companies, established by Royal Charter or by Act of Par-
liament,differinseveralrespects,notonlyfromregulatedcompanies,but
fromprivatecopartneries.
1612 [16] First, in a private copartnery, no partner, without the consent of the
company, can transfer his share to another person, or introduce a new
memberintothecompany. Eachmember,however,may,uponproperwarn-
ing,withdrawfromthecopartnery,anddemandpaymentfromthemofhis
share of the common stock. In a joint stock company, on the contrary, no
member can demand payment of his share from the company; but each
member can, without their consent, transfer his share to another person,
andtherebyintroduceanewmember. Thevalueofashareinajointstock
is always the price which it will bring in the market; and this may be
either greater or less, in any proportion, than the sum which its owner
standscreditedforinthestockofthecompany.
1613 [17] Secondly, in a private copartnery, each partner is bound for the debts
contracted by the company to the whole extent of his fortune. In a joint
stockcompany,onthecontrary,eachpartnerisboundonlytotheextentof G.ed.p741
hisshare.
1614 [18] Thetradeofajointstockcompanyisalwaysmanagedbyacourtofdir-
ectors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to the
controlofageneralcourtofproprietors. Butthegreaterpartofthosepro-
prietorsseldompretendtounderstandanythingofthebusinessofthecom-
pany, and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them,
give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly such half-
yearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them.
Thistotalexemptionfromtroubleandfromrisk,beyondalimitedsum,en-
couragesmanypeopletobecomeadventurersinjointstockcompanies,who
would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery.
Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves much greater
stocks than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading stock of the
SouthSeaCompany,atonetime,amountedtoupwardsofthirty-threemil-
lions eight hundred thousand pounds. The divided capital of the Bank of
England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty
thousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however, being the
574 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
managersratherofotherpeople’smoneythanoftheirown, itcannotwell
be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigil-
ance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch
over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider
attentiontosmallmattersasnotfortheirmaster’shonour,andveryeasily
give themselves a dispensation from having it. Negligence and profusion,
therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the
affairs of such a company. It is upon this account that joint stock com-
panies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competi-
tionagainstprivateadventurers. Theyhave,accordingly,veryseldomsuc-
ceeded without an exclusive privilege, and frequently have not succeeded
with one. Without an exclusive privilege they have commonly misman-
aged the trade. With an exclusive privilege they have both mismanaged
andconfinedit.
1615 [19] The Royal African Company, the predecessors of the present African
Company, had an exclusive privilege by charter, but as that charter had G.ed.p742
not been confirmed by Act of Parliament, the trade, in consequence of
the Declaration of Rights, was, soon after the revolution, laid open to all
his Majesty’s subjects. The Hudson’s Bay Company are, as to their legal
rights, in the same situation as the Royal African Company. Their ex-
clusive charter has not been confirmed by Act of Parliament. The South
Sea Company, as long as they continued to be a trading company, had an
exclusive privilege confirmed by Act of Parliament; as have likewise the
presentUnitedCompanyofMerchantstradingtotheEastIndies.
1616 [20] The Royal African Company soon found that they could not maintain
the competition against private adventurers, whom, notwithstanding the
Declaration of Rights, they continued for some time to call interlopers,
andtopersecuteassuch. In1698, however, theprivateadventurerswere
subjected to a duty of ten per cent upon almost all the different branches
oftheirtrade,tobeemployedbythecompanyinthemaintenanceoftheir
fortsandgarrisonsBut,notwithstandingthisheavytax,thecompanywere
stillunabletomaintainthecompetition. Theirstockandcreditgradually
declined. In 1712, their debts had become so great that a particular Act
of Parliament was thought necessary, both for their security and for that
oftheircreditors. Itwasenactedthattheresolutionoftwo-thirdsofthese
creditors in number and value should bind the rest, both with regard to
thetimewhichshouldbeallowedtothecompanyforthepaymentoftheir G.ed.p743
debts, and with regard to any other agreement which it might be thought
proper to make with them concerning those debts. In 1730, their affairs
wereinsogreatdisorderthattheywerealtogetherincapableofmaintain-
ing their forts and garrisons, the sole purpose and pretext of their insti-
tution. From that year, till their final dissolution, the Parliament judged
itnecessarytoallowtheannualsumoftenthousandpoundsforthatpur-
pose. In 1732, after having been for many years losers by the trade of
carrying negroes to the West Indies, they at last resolved to give it up al-
575 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
together; to sell to the private traders to America the negroes which they
purchased upon the coast; and to employ their servants in a trade to the
inland parts of Africa for gold dust, elephants’ teeth, dyeing drugs, etc.
Buttheirsuccessinthismoreconfinedtradewasnotgreaterthanintheir

atlast,beingineveryrespectabankruptcompany,theyweredissolvedby
ActofParliament,andtheirfortsandgarrisonsvestedinthepresentreg-

Royal African Company, there had been three other joint stock compan-
iessuccessivelyestablished,oneafteranother,fortheAfricantrade. They
were all equally unsuccessful. They all, however, had exclusive charters,
which,thoughnotconfirmedbyActofParliament,wereinthosedayssup-
posedtoconveyarealexclusiveprivilege.
1617 [21] The Hudson’s Bay Company, before their misfortunes in the late war,
had been much more fortunate than the Royal African Company. Their
necessary expense is much smaller. The whole number of people whom
they maintain in their different settlements and habitations, which they
havehonouredwiththenameofforts,issaidnottoexceedahundredand
twentypersons. Thisnumber,however,issufficienttopreparebeforehand
thecargooffursandothergoodsnecessaryforloadingtheirships,which,
onaccountoftheice,canseldomremainabovesixoreightweeksinthose

eralyearsbeacquiredbyprivateadventurers,andwithoutitthereseems

company,which,itissaid,doesnotexceedonehundredandtenthousand
pounds, may besides be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole, or G.ed.p744
almost the whole, trade and surplus produce of the miserable, though ex-
tensivecountry,comprehendedwithintheircharter. Noprivateadventur-
ers, accordingly, have ever attempted to trade to that country in competi-
tionwiththem. Thiscompany,therefore,havealwaysenjoyedanexclusive
trade in fact, though they may have no right to it in law. Over and above
allthis,themoderatecapitalofthiscompanyissaidtobedividedamonga
verysmallnumberofproprietors. Butajointstockcompany,consistingof
a small number of proprietors, with a moderate capital, approaches very
nearlytothenatureofaprivatecopartnery,andmaybecapableofnearly
the same degree of vigilance and attention. It is not to be wondered at,
therefore, if, in consequence of these different advantages, the Hudson’s
Bay Company had, before the late war, been able to carry on their trade
withaconsiderabledegreeofsuccess. Itdoesnotseemprobable,however,
that their profits ever approached to what the late Mr. Dobbs imagined
them. A much more sober and judicious writer, Mr. Anderson, author of
The Historical and Chronological Deduction of Commerce, very justly ob-
servesthat,uponexaminingtheaccountsofwhichMr.Dobbshimselfwas
given for several years together of their exports and imports, and upon
makingproperallowancesfortheirextraordinaryriskandexpense,itdoes

not appear that their profits deserve to be envied, or that they can much,
ifatall,exceedtheordinaryprofitsoftrade.

and therefore were entirely exempted from one great expense to which

naturally to be expected, therefore, that folly, negligence, and profusion
shouldprevailinthewholemanagementoftheiraffairs. Theknaveryand
extravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently known, and
theexplicationofthemwouldbeforeigntothepresentsubject. Theirmer-
cantileprojectswerenotmuchbetterconducted. Thefirsttradewhichthey
engagedinwasthatofsupplyingtheSpanishWestIndieswithnegroes,of
which (in consequence of what was called the Assiento contract granted
them by the Treaty of Utrecht) they had the exclusive privilege. But as
it was not expected that much profit could be made by this trade, both
thePortugueseandFrenchcompanies, whohadenjoyedituponthesame
terms before them, having been ruined by it, they were allowed, as com-
pensation, to send annually a ship of a certain burden to trade directly to
the Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages which this annual ship was
allowedtomake,theyaresaidtohavegainedconsiderablybyone,thatof
theRoyalCarolinein1731,andtohavebeenlosers,moreorless,byalmost

principally owing to the profusion and depredations of those very factors

1619 [23] In 1724, this company had undertaken the whale-fishery. Of this, in-
deed, they had no monopoly; but as long as they carried it on, no other
British subjects appear to have engaged in it. Of the eight voyages which
theirshipsmadetoGreenland,theyweregainersbyone,andlosersbyall

stores, and utensils, they found that their whole loss, upon this branch,
capital and interest included, amounted to upwards of two hundred and
thirty-seventhousandpounds.
1620 [24] In 1722, this company petitioned the Parliament to be allowed to di-
vide their immense capital of more than thirty-three millions eight hun-
dred thousand pounds, the whole of which had been lent to government,
into two equal parts: The one half, or upwards of sixteen millions nine
hundredthousandpounds,tobeputuponthesamefootingwithothergov- G.ed.p746

cantileprojects;theotherhalftoremain,asbefore,atradingstock,andto
577 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
be subject to those debts and losses. The petition was too reasonable not
to be granted. In 1733, they again petitioned the Parliament that three-
fourthsoftheirtradingstockmightbeturnedintoannuitystock,andonly
one-fourthremainastradingstock,orexposedtothehazardsarisingfrom
the bad management of their directors. Both their annuity and trading
stockshad,bythistime,beenreducedmorethantwomillionseachbysev-

1621 [25] It ought to be observed that in the trade which the South Sea Com-
pany carried on by means of their annual ship, the only trade by which
it ever was expected that they could make any considerable profit, they
werenotwithoutcompetitors,eitherintheforeignorinthehomemarket.
At Carthagena, Porto Bello, and La Vera Cruz, they had to encounter the
competition of the Spanish merchants, who brought from Cadiz, to those
markets,Europeangoodsofthesamekindwiththeoutwardcargooftheir
ship;andinEnglandtheyhadtoencounterthatoftheEnglishmerchants,
who imported from Cadiz goods of the Spanish West Indies of the same
kind with the inward cargo. The goods both of the Spanish and English
merchants, indeed, were, perhaps, subject to higher duties. But the loss
occasioned by the negligence, profusion, and malversation of the servants
of the company had probably been a tax much heavier than all those du-
ties. Thatajointstockcompanyshouldbeabletocarryonsuccessfullyany
branch of foreign trade, when private adventurers can come into any sort
ofopenandfaircompetitionwiththem,seemscontrarytoallexperience.
1622 [26] The old English East India Company was established in 1600 by a
charterfromQueenElizabeth. Inthefirsttwelvevoyageswhichtheyfitted G.ed.p747

aratestocks,thoughonlyinthegeneralshipsofthecompany. In1612,they
unitedintoajointstock. Theircharterwasexclusive,andthoughnotcon-
firmed by Act of Parliament, was in those days supposed to convey a real
exclusive privilege. For many years, therefore, they were not much dis-
turbedbyinterlopers. Theircapital,whichneverexceededsevenhundred
and forty-four thousand pounds, and of which fifty pounds was a share,
was not so exorbitant, nor their dealings so extensive, as to afford either
apretextforgrossnegligenceandprofusion,oracovertogrossmalversa-
tion. Notwithstandingsomeextraordinarylosses,occasionedpartlybythe
malice of the Dutch East India Company, and partly by other accidents,
they carried on for many years a successful trade. But in process of time,
whentheprinciplesoflibertywerebetterunderstood,itbecameeveryday
more and more doubtful how far a Royal Charter, not confirmed by Act of
578 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Parliament, could convey an exclusive privilege. Upon this question the
decisions of the courts of justice were not uniform, but varied with the
authorityofgovernmentandthehumoursofthetimes. Interlopersmulti-
plied upon them, and towards the end of the reign of Charles II, through
the whole of that of James II and during a part of that of William III, re-
ducedthemtogreatdistress. In1698,aproposalwasmadetoParliament
of advancing two millions to government at eight per cent, provided the
subscribers were erected into a new East India Company with exclusive
privileges. The old East India Company offered seven hundred thousand
pounds,nearlytheamountoftheircapital,atfourpercentuponthesame
conditions. Butsuchwasatthattimethestateofpubliccredit,thatitwas
more convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight per cent
than seven hundred thousand pounds at four. The proposal of the new
subscribers was accepted, and a new East India Company established in
consequence. The old East India Company, however, had a right to con-
tinue their trade till 1701. They had, at the same time, in the name of
their treasurer, subscribed, very artfully, three hundred and fifteen thou-
sandpoundsintothestockofthenew. Byanegligenceintheexpressionof
theActofParliamentwhichvestedtheEastIndiatradeinthesubscribers
to this loan of two millions, it did not appear evident that they were all G.ed.p748
obliged to unite into a joint stock. A few private traders, whose subscrip-
tionsamountedonlytoseventhousandtwohundredpounds,insistedupon
theprivilegeoftradingseparatelyupontheirownstocksandattheirown
risk. The old East India Company had a right to a separate trade upon
theiroldstocktill1701; andtheyhadlikewise, bothbeforeandafterthat
period,aright,likethatofotherprivatetraders,toaseparatetradeupon
thethreehundredandfifteenthousandpoundswhichtheyhadsubscribed
into the stock of the new company. The competition of the two companies
with the private traders, and with one another, is said to have well-nigh
ruined both. Upon a subsequent occasion, in 1730, when a proposal was
madetoParliamentforputtingthetradeunderthemanagementofaregu-
latedcompany,andtherebylayingitinsomemeasureopen,theEastIndia
Company, inoppositiontothisproposal, representedinverystrongterms
what had been, at this time, the miserable effects, as they thought them,
ofthiscompetition. InIndia,theysaid,itraisedthepriceofgoodssohigh
thattheywerenotworththebuying;andinEngland,byoverstockingthe

very much their price in the Indian market seems not very probable, as
alltheextraordinarydemandwhichthatcompetitioncouldoccasionmust
have been but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian Com-
merce. The increase of demand, besides, though in the beginning it may

courages production, and thereby increases the competition of the produ-
cers,who,inordertounderselloneanother,haverecoursetonewdivisions

been thought of. The miserable effects of which the company complained
were the cheapness of consumption and the encouragement given to pro-
duction,preciselythetwoeffectswhichitisthegreatbusinessofpolitical
economy to promote. The competition, however, of which they gave this
doleful account, had not been allowed to be of long continuance. In 1702,
thetwocompanieswere,insomemeasure,unitedbyanindenturetripart-
ite,towhichthequeenwasthethirdparty;andin1708,theywere,byact
of parliament, perfectly consolidated into one company by their present G.ed.p749
nameoftheTheUnitedCompanyofMerchantstradingtotheEastIndies.
Into this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause allowing the
separate traders to continue their trade till Michaelmas 1711, but at the
same time empowering the directors, upon three years’ notice, to redeem
their little capital of seven thousand two hundred pounds, and thereby to
convertthewholestockofthecompanyintoajointstock. Bythesameact,
the capital of the company, in consequence of a new loan to government,
wasaugmentedfromtwomillionstothreemillionstwohundredthousand
pounds. In 1743, the company advanced another million to government.
But this million being raised, not by a call upon the proprietors, but by
sellingannuitiesandcontractingbond-debts,itdidnotaugmentthestock

theirtradingstock,itbeingequallyliablewiththeotherthreemillionstwo
hundredthousandpoundstothelossessustained,anddebtscontracted,by
the company in prosecution of their mercantile projects. From 1708, or at
least from 1711, this company, being delivered from all competitors, and
fullyestablishedinthemonopolyoftheEnglishcommercetotheEastIn-
dies, carried on a successful trade, and from their profits made annually
a moderate dividend to their proprietors. During the French war, which
began in 1741, the ambition of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pon-
dicherry, involved them in the wars of the Carnatic, and in the politics of
theIndianprinces. Aftermanysignalsuccesses,andequallysignallosses,
they at last lost Madras, at that time their principal settlement in India.
It was restored to them by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; and about this
timethespiritofwarandconquestseemstohavetakenpossessionoftheir
servants in India, and never since to have left them. During the French
war, which began in 1755, their arms partook of the general good fortune
of those of Great Britain. They defended Madras, took Pondicherry, re-
coveredCalcutta,andacquiredtherevenuesofarichandextensiveterrit-

administrationlaidclaimtotheirterritorialacquisitions,andtherevenue
arising from them, as of right belonging to the crown; and the company,
in compensation for this claim, agreed to pay the government four hun-
580 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
dred thousand pounds a year. They had before this gradually augmented
their dividend from about six to ten per cent; that is, upon their capital G.ed.p750
of three millions two hundred thousand pounds they had increased it by
a hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds, or had raised it from one
hundredandninety-twothousandtothreehundredandtwentythousand
pounds a year. They were attempting about this time to raise it still fur-
ther, to twelve and a half per cent, which would have made their annual
payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay an-
nually to government, or to four hundred thousand pounds a year. But
during the two years in which their agreement with government was to
take place, they were restrained from any further increase of dividend by
twosuccessiveActsofParliament,ofwhichtheobjectwastoenablethem
to make a speedier progress in the payment of their debts, which were
at this time estimated at upwards of six or seven millions sterling. In
1769,theyrenewedtheiragreementwithgovernmentforfiveyearsmore,
and stipulated that during the course of that period they should be al-
lowed gradually to increase their dividend to twelve and a half per cent;
never increasing it, however, more than one per cent in one year. This in-
creaseofdividend,therefore,whenithadrisentoitsutmostheight,could
augment their annual payments, to their proprietors and government to-
gether, but by six hundred and eight thousand pounds beyond what they
hadbeenbeforetheirlateterritorialacquisitions. Whatthegrossrevenue
of those territorial acquisitions was supposed to amount to has already
beenmentioned;andbyanaccountbroughtbytheCruttendenEastIndia-
manin1768,thenetrevenue,clearofalldeductionsandmilitarycharges,
was stated at two millions forty-eight thousand seven hundred and forty-
seven pounds. They were said at the same time to possess another rev-
enue, arising partly from lands, but chiefly from the customs established
at their different settlements, amounting to four hundred and thirty-nine
thousand pounds. The profits of their trade too, according to the evid-
ence of their chairman before the House of Commons, amounted at this
time to at least four hundred thousand pounds a year, according to that
of their accountant, to at least five hundred thousand; according to the
lowest account, at least equal to the highest dividend that was to be paid
to their proprietors. So great a revenue might certainly have afforded an
augmentation of six hundred and eight thousand pounds in their annual
payments, and at the same time have left a large sinking fund sufficient
for the speedy reduction of their debts. In 1773, however, their debts, in-
steadofbeingreduced,wereaugmentedbyanarreartothetreasuryinthe
payment of the four hundred thousand pounds, by another to the custom-
house for duties unpaid, by a large debt to the bank for money borrowed,
and by a fourth for bills drawn upon them from India, and wantonly ac- G.ed.p751
cepted, to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand pounds.
The distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them, obliged
them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per cent, but to
581 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
throw themselves upon the mercy of government, and to supplicate, first,
a release from further payment of the stipulated four hundred thousand
poundsayear;and,secondly,aloanoffourteenhundredthousand,tosave
themfromimmediatebankruptcy. Thegreatincreaseoftheirfortunehad,
it seems, only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for greater
profusion, and a cover for greater malversation, than in proportion even
to that increase of fortune. The conduct of their servants in India, and
the general state of their affairs both in India and in Europe, became the
subject of a Parliamentary inquiry, in consequence of which several very
importantalternationsweremadeintheconstitutionoftheirgovernment,
both at home and abroad. In India their principal settlements of Madras,
Bombay, and Calcutta, which had before been altogether independent of
oneanother,weresubjectedtoagovernor-general,assistedbyacouncilof
four assessors, Parliament assuming to itself the first nomination of this
governorandcouncilwhoweretoresideatCalcutta;thatcityhavingnow
become,whatMadraswasbefore,themostimportantoftheEnglishsettle-
ments in India. The Court of the Mayor of Calcutta, originally instituted
for the trial of mercantile causes which arose in city and neighbourhood,
had gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire.
Itwasnowreducedandconfinedtotheoriginalpurposeofitsinstitution.
Insteadofitanewsupremecourtofjudicaturewasestablished,consisting
ofachiefjusticeandthreejudgestobeappointedbythecrown. InEurope,
the qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to vote at their general
courts was raised from five hundred pounds, the original price of a share G.ed.p752
in the stock of the company, to a thousand pounds. In order to vote upon
this qualification too, it was declared necessary that he should have pos-
sessed it, if acquired by his own purchase, and not by inheritance, for at
least one year, instead of six months, the term requisite before. The court
of twenty-four directors had before been chosen annually; but it was now
enactedthateachdirectorshould,forthefuture,bechosenforfouryears;
six of them, however, to go out of office by rotation every year, and not to
becapableofbeingre-chosenattheelectionofthesixnewdirectorsforthe
ensuing year. In consequence of these alterations, the courts, both of the
proprietorsanddirectors,itwasexpected,wouldbelikelytoactwithmore
dignity and steadiness than they had usually done before. But it seems
impossible, by any alterations, to render those courts, in any respect, fit
to govern, or even to share in the government of a great empire; because
the greater part of their members must always have too little interest in
the prosperity of that empire to give any serious attention to what may
promote it. Frequently a man of great, sometimes even a man of small
fortune, is willing to purchase a thousand pounds’ share in India stock

appointmentoftheplunderersofIndia;thecourtofdirectors,thoughthey
makethatappointment,beingnecessarilymoreorlessundertheinfluence
582 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of the proprietors, who not only elect those directors, but sometimes over-
rule the appointments of their servants in India. Provided he can enjoy
this influence for a few years, and thereby provide for a certain number
of his friends, he frequently cares little about the dividend, or even about
the value of the stock upon which his vote is founded. About the prosper-
ity of the great empire, in the government of which that vote gives him a
share, he seldom cares at all. No other sovereigns ever were, or, from the
natureofthings,evercouldbe,soperfectlyindifferentaboutthehappiness
or misery of their subjects, the improvement or waste of their dominions,
the glory or disgrace of their administration, as, from irresistible moral
causes, the greater part of the proprietors of such a mercantile company
are, and necessarily must be. This indifference, too, was more likely to
be increased than diminished by some of the new regulations which were
made in consequence of the Parliamentary inquiry. By a resolution of the
House of Commons, for example, it was declared, that when the fourteen
hundred thousand pounds lent to the company by government should be
paid,andtheirbond-debtsbereducedtofifteenhundredthousandpounds,
theymightthen,andnottillthen,divideeightpercentupontheircapital;
and that whatever remained of their revenues and net profits at home G.ed.p753
should be divided into four parts; three of them to be paid into the ex-
chequer for the use of the public, and the fourth to be reserved as a fund
eitherforthefurtherreductionoftheirbond-debts,orforthedischargeof
other contingent exigencies which the company might labour under. But
if the company were bad stewards, and bad sovereigns, when the whole
oftheirnetrevenueandprofitsbelongedtothemselves,andwereattheir
own disposal, they were surely not likely to be better when three-fourths
ofthemweretobelongtootherpeople, andtheotherfourth, thoughtobe
laid out for the benefit of the company, yet to be so under the inspection
andwiththeapprobationofotherpeople.
1623 [27] It might be more agreeable to the company that their own servants
and dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting or the profit
of embezzling whatever surplus might remain after paying the proposed
dividendofeightpercentthanthatitshouldcomeintothehandsofaset

support the authors of depredations which had been committed in direct
violationofitsownauthority. Withthemajorityofproprietors,thesupport
even of the authority of their own court might sometimes be a matter of
less consequence than the support of those who had set that authority at
defiance.
1624 [28] The regulations of 1773, accordingly, did not put an end to the dis-
orders of the company’s government in India. Notwithstanding that, dur-
ing a momentary fit of good conduct, they had at one time collected into
the treasury of Calcutta more than three millions sterling; notwithstand-
583 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ingthattheyhadafterwardsextended,eithertheirdominion,ortheirde-
predations, over a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile
countries in India, all was wasted and destroyed. They found themselves
altogether unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of Hyder Ali; and,
in consequence of those disorders, the company is now (1784) in greater
distressthanever;and,inordertopreventimmediatebankruptcy,isonce
more reduced to supplicate the assistance of government. Different plans
have been proposed by the different parties in Parliament for the better
managementofitsaffairs. Andallthoseplansseemtoagreeinsupposing,
what was indeed always abundantly evident, that it is altogether unfit to
governitsterritorialpossessions. Eventhecompanyitselfseemstobecon- G.ed.p754
vinced of its own incapacity so far, and seems, upon that account, willing
togivethemuptogovernment.
1625 [29] Withtherightofpossessingfortsandgarrisonsindistantandbarbar-
ous countries is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war
inthosecountries. Thejointstockcompanieswhichhavehadtheoneright
have constantly exercised the other, and have frequently had it expressly
conferred upon them. How unjustly, how capriciously, how cruelly they
havecommonlyexercisedit,istoowellknownfromrecentexperience.
1626 [30] When a company of merchants undertake, at their own risk and ex-
pense,toestablishanewtradewithsomeremoteandbarbarousnation,it
may not be unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint stock company,
and to grant them, in case of their success, a monopoly of the trade for a
certain number of years. It is the easiest and most natural way in which
the state can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive
experiment, of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A tem-
porary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the same principles
upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor,
andthatofanewbooktoitsauthor. Butupontheexpirationoftheterm, G.ed.p755
the monopoly ought certainly to determine; the forts and garrisons, if it

dia Company, upon the redemption of their funds, and the expiration of
their exclusive privilege, have right, by Act of Parliament, to continue a
corporation with a joint stock, and to trade in their corporate capacity to
the East Indies in common with the rest of their fellow-subjects. But in
thissituation, thesuperiorvigilanceandattentionofprivateadventurers
would,inallprobability,soonmakethemwearyofthetrade.
1627 [31] An eminent French author, of great knowledge in matters of political
economy, the Abbe Morellet, gives a list of fifty-five joint stock companies
forforeigntradewhichhavebeenestablishedindifferentpartsofEurope
since the year 1600, and which, according to him, have all failed from
mismanagement, notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges. He has
beenmisinformedwithregardtothehistoryoftwoorthreeofthem,which
werenotjointstockcompaniesandhavenotfailed. But,incompensation, G.ed.p756
therehavebeenseveraljointstockcompanieswhichhavefailed,andwhich
hehasomitted.
1628 [32] The only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to
carry on successfully without an exclusive privilege are those of which all
theoperationsarecapableofbeingreducedtowhatiscalledaRoutine,or
to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation. Of this
kindis,first,thebankingtrade;secondly,thetradeofinsurancefromfire,
andfromseariskandcaptureintimeofwar;thirdly,thetradeofmaking
and maintaining a navigable cut or canal; and, fourthly, the similar trade
ofbringingwaterforthesupplyofagreatcity.
1629 [33] Though the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat ab-
struse, the practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules. To depart
uponanyoccasionfromthoserules,inconsequenceofsomeflatteringspec-
ulation of extraordinary gain, is almost always extremely dangerous, and

in Europe, accordingly, are joint stock companies, many of which manage
their trade very successfully without any exclusive privilege. The Bank
of England has no other exclusive privilege except that no other banking

1630 [34] Thevalueoftherisk,eitherfromfire,orfromlossbysea,orbycapture,
though it cannot, perhaps, be calculated very exactly, admits, however, of
such a gross estimation as renders it, in some degree, reducible to strict
ruleandmethod. Thetradeofinsurance,therefore,maybecarriedonsuc-
cessfullybyajointstockcompanywithoutanyexclusiveprivilege. Neither
theLondonAssurancenortheRoyalExchangeAssurancecompanieshave
anysuchprivilege.
1631 [35] When a navigable cut or canal has been once made, the management
of it becomes quite simple and easy, and it is reducible to strict rule and G.ed.p757
method. Eventhemakingofitissoasitmaybecontractedforwithunder-

merely because such a company might be capable of managing it success-
fully;ortoexemptaparticularsetofdealersfromsomeofthegenerallaws

inthiscase,thedemandforwhatitwastoproducewouldreadilyandeas-

boththosecircumstancesconcur.
1633 [37] The great and general utility of the banking trade when prudently
managed has been fully explained in the second, book of this Inquiry.
But a public bank which is to support public credit, and upon particu-
lar emergencies to advance to government the whole produce of a tax, to
the amount, perhaps, of several millions, a year or two before it comes
in, requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private
copartnery.
1634 [38] The trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private
people, and by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin
an individual, makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society. In or-
der to give this security, however, it is necessary that the insurers should
have a very large capital. Before the establishment of the two joint stock
companies for insurance in London, a list, it is said, was laid before the
586 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
attorney-general of one hundred and fifty private insurers who had failed
inthecourseofafewyears.
1635 [39] That navigable cuts and canals, and the works which are sometimes
necessary for supplying a great city with water, are of great and general
utility, while at the same time they frequently require a greater expense G.ed.p758
thansuitsthefortunesofprivatepeople,issufficientlyobvious.
1636 [40] Except the four trades above mentioned, I have not been able to re-
collect any other in which all the three circumstances requisite for ren-

English copper company of London, the lead smelting company, the glass
grindingcompany,havenoteventhepretextofanygreatorsingularutil-

seem to require any expense unsuitable to the fortunes of many private
men. Whether the trade which those companies carry on is reducible to

Itshouldnotseemverydifficulttogiveatleastaprobableanswertoeach
ofthosequestions.
1640 [4] In every profession, the exertion of the greater part of those who exer-
cise it is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of making
that exertion. This necessity is greatest with those to whom the emolu-
mentsoftheirprofessionaretheonlysourcefromwhichtheyexpecttheir
fortune, or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence. In order to ac-
quirethisfortune,oreventogetthissubsistence,theymust,inthecourse

thecompetitionisfree,therivalshipofcompetitors,whoareallendeavour-
ingtojustleoneanotheroutofemployment,obligeseverymantoendeav-
our to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness. The greatness
of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some particular pro-
fessions may, no doubt, sometimes animate the exertion of a few men of
extraordinary spirit and ambition. Great objects, however, are evidently
not necessary in order to occasion the greatest exertions. Rivalship and
emulation render excellency, even in mean professions, an object of ambi- G.ed.p760
tion,andfrequentlyoccasiontheverygreatestexertions. Greatobjects,on
the contrary, alone and unsupported by the necessity of application, have
seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable exertion. In England,
success in the profession of the law leads to some very great objects of
ambition; and yet how few men, born to easy fortunes, have ever in this
countrybeeneminentinthatprofession!
1641 [5] The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished
moreorlessthenecessityofapplicationintheteachers. Theirsubsistence,
so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund
altogetherindependentoftheirsuccessandreputationintheirparticular
professions.
1642 [6] In some universities the salary makes but a part, and frequently but
a small part, of the emoluments of the teacher, of which the greater part
arises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils. The necessity of applic-
ation, though always more or less diminished, is not in this case entirely
taken away. Reputation in his profession is still of some importance to
him, and he still has some dependency upon the affection, gratitude, and
588 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
favourable report of those who have attended upon his instructions; and
these favourable sentiments he is likely to gain in no way so well as by
deserving them, that is, by the abilities and diligence with which he dis-
chargeseverypartofhisduty.
1643 [7] In other universities the teacher is prohibited from receiving any hon-
orary or fee from his pupils, and his salary constitutes the whole of the
revenue which he derives from his office. His interest is, in this case, set
as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it. It is the in-
terestofeverymantoliveasmuchathiseaseashecan;andifhisemolu-
ments are to be precisely the same, whether he does or does not perform
some very laborious duty, it is certainly his interest, at least as interest
is vulgarly understood, either to neglect it altogether, or, if he is subject
to some authority which will not suffer him to do this, to perform it in as

urallyactiveandaloveroflabour,itishisinteresttoemploythatactivity

1644 [8] If the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate, G.ed.p761

superiors, however, canforcehimtodo, istoattenduponhispupilsacer-
tain number of hours, that is, to give a certain number of lectures in the
week or in the year. What those lectures shall be must still depend upon
thediligenceoftheteacher;andthatdiligenceislikelytobeproportioned
to the motives which he has for exerting it. An extraneous jurisdiction of
thiskind,besides,isliabletobeexercisedbothignorantlyandcapriciously.
In its nature it is arbitrary and discretionary, and the persons who exer-
cise it, neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves, nor
perhaps understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach, are
seldom capable of exercising it with judgment. From the insolence of of-
fice,too,theyarefrequentlyindifferenthowtheyexerciseit,andarevery
apt to censure or deprive him of his office wantonly, and without any just
cause. The person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by
it,and,insteadofbeingoneofthemostrespectable,isrenderedoneofthe

1647 [11] The privileges of graduates in arts, in law, physic, and divinity, when
they can be obtained only by residing a certain number of years in cer-
tain universities, necessarily force a certain number of students to such
universities, independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers. The
privilegesofgraduatesareasortofstatutesofapprenticeship,whichhave
contributed to the improvement of education, just as the other statutes of
apprenticeshiphavetothatofarts,andmanufactures.
1648 [12] The charitable foundations of scholarships, exhibitions, bursaries,
etc., necessarily attach a certain number of students to certain colleges,
independent altogether of the merit of those particular colleges. Were the G.ed.p763
studentsuponsuchcharitablefoundationsleftfreetochoosewhatcollege

lation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which pro-
hibited even the independent members of every particular college from
leaving it and going to any other, without leave first asked and obtained
ofthatwhichtheymeanttoabandon,wouldtendverymuchtoextinguish
thatemulation.

tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the different tutors of

very well paid by their students, might be as much disposed to neglect
them as those who are not paid by them at all, or who have no other re-
compensebuttheirsalary.
1650 [14] If the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant
thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing his students, that he is
eitherspeakingorreadingnonsense,orwhatisverylittlebetterthannon-
sense. It must, too, be unpleasant to him to observe that the greater part

insteadofexplainingtohispupilshimselfthescienceinwhichheproposes
to instruct them, may read some book upon it; and if this book is written
in a foreign and dead language, by interpreting it to them into their own;
or, what would give him still less trouble, by making them interpret it to
him, and by now and then making an occasional remark upon it, he may
flatter himself that he is giving a lecture. The slightest degree of know-
ledge and application will enable him to do this without exposing himself
to contempt or derision, or saying anything that is really foolish, absurd,
or ridiculous. The discipline of the college, at the same time, may enable
him to force all his pupils to the most regular attendance upon this sham
lecture, andto maintain the most decentand respectful behaviourduring
thewholetimeoftheperformance.
1651 [15] The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not G.ed.p764

fails of acquiring them to the degree in which it is necessary to acquire

1653 [17] In England the public schools are much less corrupted than the uni-
versities. In the schools the youth are taught, or at least may be taught,
Greek and Latin; that is, everything which the masters pretend to teach,
or which, it is expected, they should teach. In the universities the youth

it is not necessary that a person should bring a certificate of his having G.ed.p765

he appears to understand what is taught there, no questions are asked
abouttheplacewherehelearntit.
1654 [18] The parts of education which are commonly taught in universities, it
may, perhaps, be said are not very well taught. But had it not been for
those institutions they would not have been commonly taught at all, and
both the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from
thewantofthoseimportantpartsofeducation.
1655 [19] The present universities of Europe were originally, the greater part of
them, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of church-
men. TheywerefoundedbytheauthorityofthePope,andweresoentirely
under his immediate protection, that their members, whether masters or
students,hadallofthemwhatwasthencalledthebenefitofclergy,thatis,
wereexemptedfromtheciviljurisdictionofthecountriesinwhichtheirre-
spectiveuniversitiesweresituated,andwereamenableonlytotheecclesi-
asticaltribunals. Whatwastaughtinthegreaterpartofthoseuniversities
was suitable to the end of their institution, either theology, or something
thatwasmerelypreparatorytotheology.
1656 [20] When Christianity was first established by law, a corrupted Latin had
becomethecommonlanguageofallthewesternpartsofEurope. Theser-
vice of the church accordingly, and the translation of the Bible which was
read in churches, were both in that corrupted Latin; that is, in the com-
monlanguageofthecountry. Aftertheirruptionofthebarbarousnations
who overturned the Roman empire, Latin gradually ceased to be the lan-
guage of any part of Europe. But the reverence of the people naturally
preserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the
circumstanceswhichfirstintroducedandrenderedthemreasonableareno
more. ThoughLatin,therefore,wasnolongerunderstoodanywherebythe
greatbodyofthepeople,thewholeserviceofthechurchstillcontinuedto
be performed in that language. Two different languages were thus estab-
592 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
lished in Europe, in the same manner as in ancient Egypt; a language of
thepriests,andalanguageofthepeople;asacredandaprofane;alearned
and an unlearned language. But it was necessary that the priests should
understand something of that sacred and learned language in which they
weretoofficiate;andthestudyoftheLatinlanguagethereforemade,from G.ed.p766
thebeginning,anessentialpartofuniversityeducation.
1657 [21] It was not so with that either of the Greek or of the Hebrew language.
The infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the Latin translation
of the Bible, commonly called the Latin Vulgate, to have been equally
dictated by divine inspiration, and therefore of equal authority with the
GreekandHebreworiginals. Theknowledgeofthosetwolanguages,there-
fore, not being indispensably requisite to a churchman, the study of them
did not for a long time make a necessary part of the common course of
university education. There are some Spanish universities, I am assured,
in which the study of the Greek language has never yet made any part of
that course. The first reformers found the Greek text of the New Testa-
ment, and even the Hebrew text of the Old, more favorable to their opin-
ionsthantheVulgatetranslation,which,asmightnaturallybesupposed,
had been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the Cath-
olic Church. They set themselves, therefore, to expose the many errors of
that translation, which the Roman Catholic clergy were thus put under
the necessity of defending or explaining. But this could not well be done
withoutsomeknowledgeoftheoriginallanguages,ofwhichthestudywas
therefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities, both
ofthosewhichembraced,andofthosewhichrejected,thedoctrinesofthe
Reformation. The Greek language was connected with every part of that
classical learning which, though at first principally cultivated by Cathol-
icsandItalians,happenedtocomeintofashionmuchaboutthesametime
thatthedoctrinesoftheReformationweresetonfoot. Inthegreaterpart
of universities, therefore, that language was taught previous to the study
of philosophy, and as soon as the student had made some progress in the
Latin. TheHebrewlanguagehavingnoconnectionwithclassicallearning,
and,excepttheHolyScriptures,beingthelanguageofnotasinglebookin
any esteem, the study of it did not commonly commence till after that of
philosophy,andwhenthestudenthadentereduponthestudyoftheology.
1658 [22] Originally the first rudiments both of the Greek and Latin languages
were taught in universities, and in some universities they still continue
to be so. In others it is expected that the student should have previously
acquiredatleasttherudimentsofoneorbothofthoselanguages,ofwhich
the study continues to make everywhere a very considerable part of uni-
versityeducation.
1659 [23] The ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three great branches;
physics,ornaturalphilosophy;ethics,ormoralphilosophy;andlogic. This
generaldivisionseemsperfectlyagreeabletothenatureofthings.
1660 [24] The great phenomena of nature- the revolutions of the heavenly bod- G.ed.p767
593 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ies,eclipses,comets;thunder,lightning,andotherextraordinarymeteors;
the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals-
are objects which, as they necessarily excite the wonder, so they natur-
ally call forth the curiosity, of mankind to inquire into their causes. Su-
perstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those
wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy
afterwardsendeavouredtoaccountforthemfrommorefamiliarcauses,or
fromsuchasmankindwerebetteracquaintedwith,thantheagencyofthe
gods. As those great phenomena are the first objects of human curiosity,
so the science which pretends to explain them must naturally have been
the first branch of philosophy that was cultivated. The first philosophers,
accordingly, of whom history has preserved any account, appear to have G.ed.p768
beennaturalphilosophers.
1661 [25] In every age and country of the world men must have attended to the
characters,designs,andactionsofoneanother,andmanyreputablerules
and maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and
approvedofbycommonconsent. Assoonaswritingcameintofashion,wise
men,orthosewhofanciedthemselvessuch,wouldnaturallyendeavourto

express their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct,

philosophy. Somethingofthesamekindwasafterwardsattemptedinmor-
als. The maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical order,
and connected together by a few common principles, in the same manner
as they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of nature.
The science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting
principlesiswhatisproperlycalledmoralphilosophy.
1662 [26] Different authors gave different systems both of natural and moral
philosophy. But the arguments by which they supported those different
systems,forfrombeingalwaysdemonstrations,werefrequentlyatbestbut
very slender probabilities, and sometimes mere sophisms, which had no
other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language.
Speculative systems have in all ages of the world been adopted for reas-
onstoo frivoloustohave determinedthejudgment ofany man ofcommon
sense in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest. Gross sophistry has
594 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
scarceeverhadanyinfluenceupontheopinionsofmankind,exceptinmat-

greatest. Thepatronsofeachsystemofnaturalandmoralphilosophynat- G.ed.p770

arguments,theywerenecessarilyledtoconsiderthedifferencebetweena

part of the ancient schools of philosophy, previously to either of those sci-
ences. The student, it seems to have been thought, to understand well

uponsubjectsofsogreatimportance.
1663 [27] This ancient division of philosophy into three parts was in the greater
partoftheuniversitiesofEuropechangedforanotherintofive.
1664 [28] In the ancient philosophy, whatever was taught concerning the nature
eitherofthehumanmindoroftheDeity,madeapartofthesystemofphys-
ics. Thosebeings,inwhatevertheiressencemightbesupposedtoconsist,
were parts of the great system of the universe, and parts, too, product-
ive of the most important effects. Whatever human reason could either
conclude or conjecture concerning them, made, as it were, two chapters,
though no doubt two very important ones, of the science which pretended
to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great system of the
universe. But in the universities of Europe, where philosophy was taught
only as subservient to theology, it was natural to dwell longer upon these
two chapters than upon any other of the science. They were gradually
more and more extended, and were divided into many inferior chapters,
till at last the doctrine of spirits, of which so little can be known, came
to take up as much room in the system of philosophy as the doctrine of
bodies, of which so much can be known. The doctrines concerning those
two subjects were considered as making two distinct sciences. What are
called Metaphysics or Pneumatics were set in opposition to Physics, and G.ed.p771
were cultivated not only as the more sublime, but, for the purposes of a
particular profession, as the more useful science of the two. The proper
subject of experiment and observation, a subject in which a careful atten-
tion is capable of making so many useful discoveries, was almost entirely
neglected. The subject in which, after a few very simple and almost obvi-
ous truths, the most careful attention can discover nothing but obscurity
anduncertainty,andcanconsequentlyproducenothingbutsubtletiesand
sophisms,wasgreatlycultivated.
1665 [29] Whenthosetwoscienceshadthusbeensetinoppositiontooneanother,
thecomparisonbetweenthemnaturallygavebirthtoathird,towhatwas
calledOntology,orthesciencewhichtreatedofthequalitiesandattributes
595 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
which were common to both the subjects of the other two sciences. But if
subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the Metaphysics or
Pneumaticsoftheschools,theycomposedthewholeofthiscobwebscience
ofOntology,whichwaslikewisesometimescalledMetaphysics.

sophyproposedtoinvestigate. Inthatphilosophythedutiesofhumanlife
weretreatedassubservienttothehappinessandperfectionofhumanlife.
But when moral, as well as natural philosophy, came to be taught only as
subservienttotheology,thedutiesofhumanlifeweretreatedofaschiefly
subservient to the happiness of a life to come. In the ancient philosophy
the perfection of virtue was represented as necessarily productive, to the
person who possessed it, of the most perfect happiness in this life. In the
modernphilosophyitwasfrequentlyrepresentedasgenerally,orratheras
almost always, inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life; and
heavenwastobeearnedonlybypenanceandmortification,bytheauster-
ities and abasement of a monk; not by the liberal, generous, and spirited
conduct of a man. Casuistry and an ascetic morality made up, in most
cases, the greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools. By far the
most important of all the different branches of philosophy became in this
mannerbyfarthemostcorrupted.
1667 [31] Such, therefore, was the common course of philosophical education in G.ed.p772
thegreaterpartoftheuniversitiesinEurope. Logicwastaughtfirst: Onto-
logycameinthesecondplace: Pneumatology,comprehendingthedoctrine
concerning the nature of the human soul and of the Deity, in the third:
in the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy which was
considered as immediately connected with the doctrines of Pneumatology,
with the immortality of the human soul, and with the rewards and pun-
ishmentswhich,fromthejusticeoftheDeity,weretobeexpectedinalife
to come: a short and superficial system of Physics usually concluded the
course.
1668 [32] The alterations which the universities of Europe thus introduced into
theancientcourseofphilosophywereallmeantfortheeducationofecclesi-
astics,andtorenderitamoreproperintroductiontothestudyoftheology.
But the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry, the casuistry and
the ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it, certainly
didnotrenderitmoreproperfortheeducationofgentlemenormenofthe
world,ormorelikelyeithertoimprovetheunderstanding,ortomendthe

1669 [33] This course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the
greater part of the universities of Europe, with more or less diligence, ac-
cordingastheconstitutionofeachparticularuniversityhappenstorender
diligence more or less necessary to the teachers. In some of the richest
and best endowed universities, the tutors content themselves with teach-
596 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ing a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course; and
eventhesetheycommonlyteachverynegligentlyandsuperficially.
1670 [34] Theimprovementswhich,inmoderntimes,havebeenmadeinseveral
different branches of philosophy have not, the greater part of them, been
made in universities, though some no doubt have. The greater part of
universitieshavenotevenbeenveryforwardtoadoptthoseimprovements

plan of education. Those improvements were more easily introduced into
some of the poorer universities, in which the teachers, depending upon G.ed.p773
their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence, were obliged to
paymoreattentiontothecurrentopinionsoftheworld.
1671 [35] But though the public schools and universities of Europe were origin-
ally intended only for the education of a particular profession, that of
churchmen; and though they were not always very diligent in instructing
their pupils even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that
profession,yettheygraduallydrewtothemselvestheeducationofalmost
all other people, particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune.

1672 [36] In England it becomes every day more and more the custom to send
youngpeopletotravelinforeigncountriesimmediatelyupontheirleaving
school, and without sending them to any university. Our young people, it
is said, generally return home much improved by their travels. A young
man who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one
and twenty, returns three or four years older than he was when he went
abroad; and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in
threeorfouryears. Inthecourseofhistravelshegenerallyacquiressome

ation either to study or to business than he could well have become in so

some tendency to form in him, instead of being riveted and confirmed, is
almost necessarily either weakened or effaced. Nothing but the discredit G.ed.p774

1673 [37] Such have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for edu-
cation.
1674 [38] Different plans and different institutions for education seem to have
takenplaceinotheragesandnations.
1675 [39] In the republics of ancient Greece, every free citizen was instructed,
under the direction of the public magistrate, in gymnastic exercises and
in music. By gymnastic exercises it was intended to harden his body, to
sharpen his courage, and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of
war;andastheGreekmilitiawas,byallaccounts,oneofthebestthatever
was in the world, this part of their public education must have answered
completelythepurposeforwhichitwasintended. Bytheotherpart,music,
itwasproposed,atleastbythephilosophersandhistorianswhohavegiven
us an account of those institutions, to humanize the mind, to soften the
temper, and to dispose it for performing all the social and moral duties
bothofpublicandprivatelife.
1676 [40] In ancient Rome the exercises of the Campus Martius answered the
purpose as those of the Gymnasium in ancient Greece, and they seem to
have answered it equally well. But among the Romans there was noth-
ing which corresponded to the musical education of the Greeks. The mor-
als of the Romans, however, both in private and public life, seem to have
been not only equal, but, upon the whole, a good deal superior to those of
the Greeks. That they were superior in private life, we have the express
testimonyofPolybiusandofDionysiusofHalicarnassus,twoauthorswell G.ed.p775
acquainted with both nations; and the whole tenor if the Greek and Ro-
man history bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the
Romans. Thegoodtemperandmoderationofcontendingfactionsseemsto
be the most essential circumstances in the public morals of a free people.
ButthefactionsoftheGreekswerealmostalwaysviolentandsanguinary;
whereas, till the time of the Gracchi, no blood had ever been shed in any
Romanfaction;andfromthetimeoftheGracchitheRomanrepublicmay
beconsideredasinrealitydissolved. Notwithstanding,therefore,thevery
respectable authority of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybius, and notwithstand-
ing the very ingenious reasons by which Mr. Montesquieu endeavours to
supportthatauthority,itseemsprobablethatthemusicaleducationofthe G.ed.p776
Greeks had no great effect in mending their morals, since, without any
such education, those of the Romans were upon the whole superior. The
respect of those ancient sages for the institutions of their ancestors had
probably disposed them to find much political wisdom in what was, per-
598 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
haps, merely an ancient custom, continued without interruption from the
earliest period of those societies to the times in which they had arrived
at a considerable degree of refinement. Music and dancing are the great
amusements of almost all barbarous nations, and the great accomplish-
mentswhicharesupposedtofitanymanforentertaininghissociety. Itis
so at this day among the negroes on the coast of Africa. It was so among
theancientCelts,amongtheancientScandinavians,and,aswemaylearn
fromHomer, amongtheancientGreeksinthetimesprecedingtheTrojan
war. When the Greek tribes had formed themselves into little republics,
it was natural that the study of those accomplishments should, for a long
time,makeapartofthepublicandcommoneducationofthepeople.
1677 [41] The masters who instructed the young people, either in music or in
militaryexercises,donotseemtohavebeenpaid,orevenappointedbythe
state,eitherinRomeoreveninAthens,theGreekrepublicofwhoselaws
and customs we are the best informed. The state required that every free
citizen should fit himself for defending it in war, and should, upon that
account,learnhismilitaryexercises. Butitlefthimtolearnthemofsuch
masters as he could find, and it seems to have advanced nothing for this
purpose but a public field or place of exercise in which he should practise G.ed.p777
andperformthem.
1678 [42] In the early ages both of the Greek and Roman republics, the other
parts of education seem to have consisted in learning to read, write, and
account according to the arithmetic of the times. These accomplishments
therichercitizensseemfrequentlytohaveacquiredathomebytheassist-

599 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
The state seems to have assigned the Academy to Plato, the Lyceum to
Aristotle, and the Portico to Zeno of Citta, the founder of the Stoics. But
Epicurus bequeathed his gardens to his own school. Till about the time
of Marcus Antonius, however, no teacher appears to have had any salary
fromthepublic,ortohavehadanyotheremolumentsbutwhatarosefrom

emperor, as we learn from Lucian, bestowed upon one of the teachers of
philosophy, probably lasted no longer than his own life. There was noth-

theTwelveTableswere, manyofthem, copiedfromthoseofsomeancient
Greek republics, yet law never seems to have grown up to be a science in
any republic of ancient Greece. In Rome it became a science very early,
and gave a considerable degree of illustration to those citizens who had
thereputationofunderstandingit. IntherepublicsofancientGreece,par-
ticularly in Athens, the ordinary courts of justice consisted of numerous,
and therefore disorderly, bodies of people, who frequently decided almost
atrandom,orasclamour,faction,andpartyspirithappenedtodetermine.
The ignominy of an unjust decision, when it was to be divided among five G.ed.p779
hundred, a thousand, or fifteen hundred people (for some of their courts
weresoverynumerous),couldnotfallveryheavyuponanyindividual. At
Rome, on the contrary, the principal courts of justice consisted either of a
single judge or of a small number of judges, whose characters, especially
astheydeliberatedalwaysinpublic,couldnotfailtobeverymuchaffected
by any rash or unjust decision. In doubtful cases such courts, from their
anxiety to avoid blame, would naturally endeavour to shelter themselves
under the example or precedent of the judges who had sat before them,
either in the same or in some other court. This attention to practice and
precedentnecessarilyformedtheRomanlawintothatregularandorderly
system in which it has been delivered down to us; and the like attention
has had the like effects upon the laws of every other country where such
attention has taken place. The superiority of character in the Romans
over that of the Greeks, so much remarked by Polybius and Dionysius of
600 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Halicarnassus,wasprobablymoreowingtothebetterconstitutionoftheir
courts of justice than to any of the circumstances to which those authors
ascribe it. The Romans are said to have been particularly distinguished
fortheirsuperiorrespecttoanoath. Butthepeoplewhowereaccustomed
to make oath only before some diligent and well-informed court of justice
would naturally be much more attentive to what they swore than they
whowereaccustomedtodothesamethingbeforemobbishanddisorderly

1681 [45] The abilities, both civil and military, of the Greeks and Romans will
readily be allowed to have been at least equal to those of any modern na-
tion. Ourprejudiceisperhapsrathertooverratethem. Butexceptinwhat
related to military exercises, the state seems to have been at no pains to
form those great abilities: for I cannot be induced to believe that the mu-
sical education of the Greeks could be of much consequence in forming
them. Masters,however,hadbeenfound,itseems,forinstructingthebet- G.ed.p780

sophers excited, in the empire which they acquired over the opinions and

1682 [46] Were there no public institutions for education, no system, no science
would be taught for which there was not some demand, or which the cir-
cumstances of the times did not render it either necessary, or convenient,
or at least fashionable, to learn. A private teacher could never find his
account in teaching either an exploded and antiquated system of a sci- G.ed.p781
ence acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally believed to be a
mereuselessandpedanticheapofsophistryandnonsense. Suchsystems,

it necessary or useful for them to learn, and they are taught nothing

pose; either to improve the natural attractions of their person, or to form
their mind to reserve, to modesty, to chastity, and to economy; to render
thembothlikelytobecomethemistressesofafamily,andtobehaveprop-
erly when they have become such. In every part of her life a woman feels
some conveniency or advantage from every part of her education. It sel-
dom happens that a man, in any part of his life, derives any conveniency
oradvantagefromsomeofthemostlaboriousandtroublesomepartsofhis

1685 [49] In some cases the state of the society necessarily places the greater
part of individuals in such situations as naturally form in them, without
any attention of government, almost all the abilities and virtues which
thatstaterequires,orperhapscanadmitof. Inothercasesthestateofthe

1686 [50] In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far
greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of the
people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations, frequently
602 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are
necessarilyformedbytheirordinaryemployments. Themanwhosewhole G.ed.p782

him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational con-
versation,butofconceivinganygenerous,noble,ortendersentiment,and
consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the
ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his
country he is altogether incapable of judging, and unless very particular
pains have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable
of defending his country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life nat-
urally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with ab-
horrencetheirregular,uncertain,andadventurouslifeofasoldier. Itcor-
rupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting
hisstrength withvigourand perseverance inany otheremploymentthan
that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade
seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual,
social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilised society
this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of
the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to
preventit.
1687 [51] Itisotherwiseinthebarbaroussocieties,astheyarecommonlycalled,

indeed,nomancanwellacquirethatimprovedandrefinedunderstanding
which a few men sometimes possess in a more civilised state. Though in
a rude society there is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every
individual, there is not a great deal in those of the whole society. Every

Thedegree,however,whichiscommonlypossessed,isgenerallysufficient
forconductingthewholesimplebusinessofthesociety. Inacivilisedstate,
on the contrary, though there is little variety in the occupations of the
greater part of individuals, there is an almost infinite variety in those of

1688 [52] The education of the common people requires, perhaps, in a civilised
andcommercialsocietytheattentionofthepublicmorethanthatofpeople
of some rank and fortune. People of some rank and fortune are generally
eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular
business, profession, ortrade, bywhichtheyproposetodistinguishthem-
selvesintheworld. Theyhavebeforethatfulltimetoacquire,oratleastto
fit themselves for afterwards acquiring, every accomplishment which can
recommendthemtothepublicesteem,orrenderthemworthyofit. Their
parentsorguardiansaregenerallysufficientlyanxiousthattheyshouldbe
so accomplished, and are, in most cases, willing enough to lay out the ex-
pensewhichisnecessaryforthatpurpose. Iftheyarenotalwaysproperly

whichthereisinthepresentstateofthingsoffindinganybetter. Theem-
ployments,too,inwhichpeopleofsomerankorfortunespendthegreater
part of their lives are not, like those of the common people, simple and
uniform. They are almost all of them extremely complicated, and such as
exercisetheheadmorethanthehands. Theunderstandingsofthosewho
are engaged in such employments can seldom grow torpid for want of ex-
ercise. The employments of people of some rank and fortune, besides, are
seldom such as harass them from morning to night. They generally have
a good deal of leisure, during which they may perfect themselves in every
branch either of useful or ornamental knowledge of which they may have
laidthefoundation,orforwhichtheymayhaveacquiredsometasteinthe
earlierpartoflife.
1689 [53] Itisotherwisewiththecommonpeople. Theyhavelittletimetospare
604 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
for education. Their parents can scarce afford to maintain them even in
infancy. As soon as they are able to work they must apply to some trade
by which they can earn their subsistence. That trade, too, is generally so G.ed.p785
simple and uniform as to give little exercise to the understanding, while,
at the same time, their labour is both so constant and so severe, that it
leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to, or even to think
of,anythingelse.
1690 [54] But though the common people cannot, in any civilised society, be so
well instructed as people of some rank and fortune, the most essential
parts of education, however, to read, write, and account, can be acquired
at so early a period of life that the greater part even of those who are to
be bred to the lowest occupations have time to acquire them before they
canbeemployedinthoseoccupations. Foraverysmallexpensethepublic
canfacilitate,canencourage,andcanevenimposeuponalmostthewhole
body of the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of
education.
1691 [55] Thepubliccanfacilitatethisacquisitionbyestablishingineveryparish
or district a little school, where children may be taught for a reward so
moderate that even a common labourer may afford it; the master being
partly, but not wholly, paid by the public, because, if he was wholly, or
even principally, paid by it, he would soon learn to neglect his business.
In Scotland the establishment of such parish schools has taught almost
the whole common people to read, and a very great proportion of them
to write and account. In England the establishment of charity schools
has had an effect of the same kind, though not so universally, because
the establishment is not so universal. If in those little schools the books,
by which the children are taught to read, were a little more instructive
than they commonly are, and if, instead of a little smattering of Latin,
whichthechildrenofthecommonpeoplearesometimestaughtthere,and
which can scarce ever be of any use to them, they were instructed in the
elementarypartsofgeometryandmechanics,theliteraryeducationofthis
rank of people would perhaps be as complete as it can be. There is scarce
acommontradewhichdoesnotaffordsomeopportunitiesofapplyingtoit G.ed.p786
the principles of geometry and mechanics, and which would not therefore

1692 [56] The public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts
ofeducationbygivingsmallpremiums, andlittlebadgesofdistinction, to
thechildrenofthecommonpeoplewhoexcelinthem.
1693 [57] The public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the
necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education, by obliging
every man to undergo an examination or probation in them before he can
obtain the freedom in any corporation, or be allowed to set up any trade
eitherinavillageortowncorporate.
605 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
1694 [58] It was in this manner, by facilitating the acquisition of their military
and gymnastic exercises, by encouraging it, and even by imposing upon
thewholebodyofthepeoplethenecessityoflearningthoseexercises,that
the Greek and Roman republics maintained the martial spirit of their re-
spectivecitizens. Theyfacilitatedtheacquisitionofthoseexercisesbyap-
pointingacertainplaceforlearningandpractisingthem,andbygranting
tocertainmasterstheprivilegeofteachinginthatplace. Thosemastersdo
not appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges of any kind.
Their reward consisted altogether in what they got from their scholars;
and a citizen who had learnt his exercises in the public gymnasia had no
sort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them privately, provided
the latter had learnt them equally well. Those republics encouraged the
acquisition of those exercises by bestowing little premiums and badges of
distinctionupon: thosewhoexcelledinthem. Tohavegainedaprizeinthe
Olympic, Isthmian, or Nemaean games, gave illustration, not only to the
personwhogainedit,buttohiswholefamilyandkindred. Theobligation
whicheverycitizenwasundertoserveacertainnumberofyears,ifcalled
upon, in the armies of the republic, sufficiently imposed the necessity of
learningthoseexercises,withoutwhichhecouldnotbefitforthatservice.
1695 [59] Thatintheprogressofimprovementthepracticeofmilitaryexercises,
unless government takes proper pains to support it, goes gradually to de-
cay,and,togetherwithit,themartialspiritofthegreatbodyofthepeople,
theexampleofmodernEuropesufficientlydemonstrates. Butthesecurity G.ed.p787
ofeverysocietymustalwaysdepend,moreorless,uponthemartialspirit
of the great body of the people. In the present times, indeed, that martial
spirit alone, and unsupported by a well-disciplined standing army, would
not perhaps be sufficient for the defence and security of any society. But
where every citizen had the spirit of a soldier, a smaller standing army
would surely be requisite. That spirit, besides, would necessarily dimin-

1696 [60] The ancient institutions of Greece and Rome seem to have been much
more effectual for maintaining the martial spirit of the great body of the
people than the establishment of what are called the militias of modern
times. They were much more simple. When they were once established
they executed themselves, and it required little or no attention from gov-
ernment to maintain them in the most perfect vigour. Whereas to main-
tain, even in tolerable execution, the complex regulations of any mod-
ern militia, requires the continual and painful attention of government,

ARTICLE III
OftheExpenseoftheInstitutionsforthe
InstructionofPeopleofallAges
1698 [1] The institutions for the instruction of people of all ages are chiefly those
for religious instruction. This is a species of instruction of which the ob-
ject is not so much to render the people good citizens in this world, as
to prepare them for another and a better world in a life to come. The
teachersofthedoctrinewhichcontainsthisinstruction,inthesameman-
ner as other teachers, may either depend altogether for their subsistence
upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers, or they may derive it
from some other fund to which the law of their country may entitle them;
such as a landed estate, a tithe or land tax, an established salary or sti-
pend. Theirexertion,theirzealandindustry,arelikelytobemuchgreater
in the former situation than in the latter. In this respect the teachers
of new religions have always had a considerable advantage in attacking G.ed.p789
thoseancientandestablishedsystemsofwhichtheclergy,reposingthem-
selves upon their benefices, had neglected to keep up the fervour of faith
anddevotioninthegreatbodyofthepeople,andhavinggiventhemselves
up to indolence, were become altogether incapable of making any vigor-
ous exertion in defence even of their own establishment. The clergy of an
established and well-endowed religion frequently become men of learning
and elegance, who possess all the virtues of gentlemen, or which can re-
commend them to the esteem of gentlemen: but they are apt gradually to
lose the qualities, both good and bad, which gave them authority and in-
fluencewiththeinferiorranksofpeople,andwhichhadperhapsbeenthe
original causes of the success and establishment of their religion. Such a
clergy, when attacked by a set of popular and bold, though perhaps stu-
pid and ignorant enthusiasts, feel themselves as perfectly defenceless as
theindolent,effeminate,andfull-fednationsofthesouthernpartsofAsia
when they were invaded by the active, hardy, and hungry Tartars of the
North. Suchaclergy,uponsuchanemergency,havecommonlynootherre-
sourcethantocalluponthecivilmagistratetopersecute,destroyordrive
out their adversaries, as disturbers of the public peace. It was thus that
the Roman Catholic clergy called upon the civil magistrates to persecute
the Protestants, and the Church of England to persecute the Dissenters;
and that in general every religious sect, when it has once enjoyed for a
century or two the security of a legal establishment, has found itself in-
capableofmakinganyvigorousdefenceagainstanynewsectwhichchose
to attack its doctrine or discipline. Upon such occasions the advantage in
point of learning and good writing may sometimes be on the side of the
establishedchurch. Buttheartsofpopularity,alltheartsofgainingpros-
elytes,areconstantlyonthesideofitsadversaries. InEnglandthosearts
608 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
have been long neglected by the well-endowed clergy of the established
church,andareatpresentchieflycultivatedbytheDissentersandbythe
Methodists. The independent provisions, however, which in many places
have been made for dissenting teachers by means of voluntary subscrip-
tions, of trust rights, and other evasions of the law, seem very much to
have abated the zeal and activity of those teachers. They have many of
thembecomeverylearned,ingenious,andrespectablemen;buttheyhave
in general ceased to be very popular preachers. The Methodists, without
halfthelearningoftheDissenters,aremuchmoreinvogue.
1699 [2] IntheChurchofRome, theindustryandzealoftheinferiorclergyare
keptmorealivebythepowerfulmotiveofself-interestthanperhapsinany G.ed.p790
establishedProtestantchurch. Theparochialclergyderive,manyofthem,
a very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary oblations
of the people; a source of revenue which confession gives them many op-
portunities of improving. The mendicant orders derive their whole sub-
sistencefromsuchoblations. Itiswiththemaswiththehussarsandlight
infantry of some armies; no plunder, no pay. The parochial clergy are like
thoseteacherswhoserewarddependspartlyupontheirsalary,andpartly
upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils, and these
mustalwaysdependmoreorlessupontheirindustryandreputation. The
mendicant orders are like those teachers whose subsistence depends al-
together upon the industry. They are obliged, therefore, to use every art
whichcananimatethedevotionofthecommonpeople. Theestablishment
of the two great mendicant orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis, it is ob-
served by Machiavel, revived, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
thelanguishingfaithanddevotionoftheCatholicChurch. InRomanCath-
olic countries the spirit of devotion is supported altogether by the monks
and by the poorer parochial clergy. The great dignitaries of the church,
with all the accomplishments of gentlemen and men of the world, and
sometimes with those of men of learning, are careful enough to maintain
the necessary discipline over their inferiors, but seldom give themselves
anytroubleabouttheinstructionofthepeople.
1700 [3] ‘Most of the arts and professions in a state,’ says by far the most illus-
trious philosopher and historian of the present age,‘are of such a nature
that, while they promote the interests of the society, they are also useful
or agreeable to some individuals; and in that case, the constant rule of
the magistrate, except perhaps on the first introduction of any art, is to
leavetheprofessiontoitself,andtrustitsencouragementtotheindividu-
alswhoreapthebenefitofit. Theartisans, findingtheirprofitstoriseby
thefavouroftheircustomers,increaseasmuchaspossibletheirskilland

1701 [4] ‘But there are also some callings, which, though useful and even ne-
cessary in a state, bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual, and
609 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the re-
tainers of those professions. It must give them public encouragement in G.ed.p791
order to their subsistence, and it must provide against that negligence to
which they will naturally be subject, either by annexing particular hon-
ours to the profession, by establishing a long subordination of ranks and
astrictdependence,orbysomeotherexpedient. Thepersonsemployedin

and physicians, may safely be entrusted to the liberality of individuals,
who are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or consolation
fromtheirspiritualministryandassistance. Theirindustryandvigilance
will, no doubt, be whetted by such an additional motive; and their skill
in the profession, as well as their address in governing the minds of the
people, must receive daily increase from their increasing practice, study,
andattention.

1704 [7] Butwhatevermayhavebeenthegoodorbadeffectsoftheindependent
provision of the clergy, it has, perhaps, been very seldom bestowed upon
themfromanyviewtothoseeffects. Timesofviolentreligiouscontroversy
have generally been times of equally violent political faction. Upon such
occasions, each political party has either found it, or imagined it, for its G.ed.p792
interesttoleagueitselfwithsomeoneorotherofthecontendingreligious
sects. But this could be done only by adopting, or at least by favouring,
the tenets of that particular sect. The sect which had the good fortune
610 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to be leagued with the conquering party necessarily shared in the victory
of its ally, by whose favour and protection it was soon enabled in some
degree to silence and subdue all its adversaries. Those adversaries had
generally leagued themselves with the enemies of the conquering party,
andwerethereforetheenemiesofthatparty. Theclergyofthisparticular
secthavingthusbecomecompletemastersofthefield,andtheirinfluence
andauthoritywiththegreatbodyofthepeoplebeinginitshighestvigour,
theywerepowerfulenoughtooverawethechiefsandleadersoftheirown
party, and to oblige the civil magistrate to respect their opinions and in-
clinations. Their first demand was generally that he should silence and
subdue an their adversaries: and their second, that he should bestow an
independent provision on themselves. As they had generally contributed
a good deal to the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should
havesomeshareinthespoil. Theywereweary,besides,ofhumouringthe
people, and of depending upon their caprice for a subsistence. In making
thisdemand,therefore,theyconsultedtheirowneaseandcomfort,without
troubling themselves about the effect which it might have in future times
upontheinfluenceandauthorityoftheirorder. Thecivilmagistrate, who
could comply with this demand only by giving them something which he
wouldhavechosenmuchrathertotake,ortokeeptohimself,wasseldom
very forward to grant it. Necessity, however, always forced him to submit
atlast,thoughfrequentlynottillaftermanydelays,evasions,andaffected

surdity, imposture, or fanaticism, such as wise men have in all ages of
the world wished to see established; but such as positive law has perhaps
never yet established, and probably never will establish, in any country:
because, with regard to religion, positive law always has been, and prob-
ably always will be, more or less influenced by popular superstition and
enthusiasm. Thisplanofecclesiasticalgovernment,ormoreproperlyofno
ecclesiastical government, was what the sect called Independents, a sect
no doubt of very wild enthusiasts, proposed to establish in England to-
wardstheendofthecivilwar. Ifithadbeenestablished,thoughofavery
unphilosophical origin, it would probably by this time have been product-
ive of the most philosophical good temper and moderation with regard to
every sort of religious principle. It has been established in Pennsylvania,
where, though the Quakers happen to be the most numerous, the law in
realityfavoursnoonesectmorethananother, anditistheresaidtohave
beenproductiveofthisphilosophicalgoodtemperandmoderation.
1706 [9] But though this equality of treatment should not be productive of
this good temper and moderation in all, or even in the greater part of
the religious sects of a particular country; yet provided those sects were

the public tranquillity, the excessive zeal of each for its particular tenets
could not well be productive of any very harmful effects, but, on the con-
trary, of several good ones: and if the government was perfectly decided
both to let them all alone, and to oblige them all to let alone one another,
there is little danger that they would not of their own accord subdivide

those excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation.
The vices of levity are always ruinous to the common people, and a single
week’s thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor
workmanforever, andtodrivehimthroughdespairuponcommittingthe
most enormous crimes. The wiser and better sort of the common people,
therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such ex-

1708 [11] Almost all religious sects have begun among the common people, from
whom they have generally drawn their earliest as well as their most nu-
merous proselytes. The austere system of morality has, accordingly, been
adopted by those sects almost constantly, or with very few exceptions; for
there have been some. It was the system by which they could best recom- G.ed.p795

persons of his rank and fortune. A man of low condition, on the contrary,
is far from being a distinguished member of any great society. While he
remains in a country village his conduct may be attended to, and he may
be obliged to attend to it himself. In this situation, and in this situation
only, he may have what is called a character to lose. But as soon as he
comes into a great city he is sunk in obscurity and darkness. His conduct
613 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is observed and attended to by nobody, and he is therefore very likely to
neglect it himself, and to abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy
and vice. He never emerges so effectually from this obscurity, his conduct
never excites so much the attention of any respectable society, as by his
becoming the member of a small religious sect. He from that moment ac-

civileffectsattendit,expulsionorexcommunicationfromthesect. Inlittle
religious sects, accordingly, the morals of the common people have been
almost always remarkably regular and orderly; generally much more so
than in the established church. The morals of those little sects, indeed,
havefrequentlybeenratherdisagreeablyrigorousandunsocial.

upon that account, more than all other diversions, the objects of their pe-
culiarabhorrence.
1713 [16] In a country where the law favoured the teachers of no one religion
more than those of another, it would not be necessary that any of them
should have any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign
or executive power; or that he should have anything to do either in ap-
pointing or in dismissing them from their offices. In such a situation he
would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them, further

1714 [17] The clergy of every established church constitute a great incorpora-
tion. They can act in concert, and pursue their interest upon one plan
and with one spirit, as much as if they were under the direction of one
man; and they are frequently, too, under such direction. Their interest as
an incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign, and is

to rebel against the church, over and above this crime of rebellion have

1715 [18] Articles of faith, as well as all other spiritual matters, it is evident
enough, are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign,
who, though he may be very well qualified for protecting, is seldom sup-
posed to be so for instructing the people. With regard to such matters,
therefore, his authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the
united authority of the clergy of the established church. The public tran-
quillity, however, and his own security, may frequently depend upon the
doctrineswhichtheymaythinkpropertopropagateconcerningsuchmat-
ters. As he can seldom directly oppose their decision, therefore, with
properweightandauthority,itisnecessarythatheshouldbeabletoinflu-
enceit;andbecaninfluenceitonlybythefearsandexpectationswhichhe
may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order. Those fears
and expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or other punish-
ment,andintheexpectationoffurtherpreferment.
1716 [19] In all Christian churches the benefices of the clergy are a sort of free-
holds which they enjoy, not during pleasure, but during life or good be-
haviour. If they held them by a more precarious tenure, and were liable
to be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign
or of his ministers, it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain
theirauthoritywiththepeople,whowouldthenconsiderthemasmercen-
ary dependents upon the court, in the security of whose instructions they
could no longer have any confidence. But should the sovereign attempt
irregularly, and by violence, to deprive any number of clergymen of their
freeholds,onaccount,perhaps,oftheirhavingpropagated,withmorethan
ordinaryzeal,somefactiousorseditiousdoctrine,hewouldonlyrender,by
such persecution, both them and their doctrine ten times more popular,
and therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous, than they had
been before. Fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of govern-
ment, and ought in particular never to be employed against any order of
menwhohavethesmallestpretensionstoindependency. Toattempttoter- G.ed.p799

either to soften or to lay aside altogether. The violence which the French
government usually employed in order to oblige all their parliaments, or
sovereigncourtsofjustice,toenregisteranyunpopularedict,veryseldom
succeeded. The means commonly employed, however, the imprisonment
of all the refractory members, one would think were forcible enough. The
616 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
princesofthehouseofStewartsometimesemployedthelikemeansinor-
der to influence some of the members of the Parliament of England; and
they generally found them equally intractable. The Parliament of Eng-
land is now managed in another manner; and a very small experiment
whichtheDukeofChoiseulmadeabouttwelveyearsagoupontheParlia-
mentofParis,demonstratedsufficientlythatalltheparliamentsofFrance
might have been managed still more easily in the same manner. That ex-
periment was not pursued. For though management and persuasion are
always the easiest and the safest instruments of governments, as force
and violence are the worst and the most dangerous, yet such, it seems, is
the natural insolence of man that he almost always disdains to use the
goodinstrument,exceptwhenhecannotordarenotusethebadone. The
French government could and durst use force, and therefore disdained to
usemanagementandpersuasion. Butthereisnoorderofmen,itappears,
I believe, from the experience of all ages, upon whom it is so dangerous,
or rather so perfectly ruinous, to employ force and violence, as upon the
respected clergy of any established church. The rights, the privileges, the
personal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic who is upon good terms
with his own order are, even in the most despotic governments, more re-
spected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune.
It is so in every gradation of despotism, from that of the gentle and mild
governmentofParistothatoftheviolentandfuriousgovernmentofCon-
stantinople. But though this order of men can scarce ever be forced, they
maybemanagedaseasilyasanyother;andthesecurityofthesovereign,
as well as the public tranquillity, seems to depend very much upon the
means which he has of managing them; and those means seem to consist
altogetherintheprefermentwhichhehastobestowuponthem.
1717 [20] In the ancient constitution of the Christian church, the bishop of each
diocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of
the episcopal city. The people did not long retain their right of election;
andwhiletheydidretainit,theyalmostalwaysactedundertheinfluence
of the clergy, who in such spiritual matters appeared to be their natural
guides. The clergy, however, soon grew weary of the trouble of managing
them, and found it easier to elect their own bishops themselves. The ab-
bot, in the same manner, was elected by the monks of the monastery, at
least in the greater part of the abbacies. All the inferior ecclesiastical be- G.ed.p800

1718 [21] Through the greater part of Europe the Pope gradually drew to him-
self first the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies, or of what
were called Consistorial benefices, and afterwards, by various machina-
tionsandpretences,ofthegreaterpartofinferiorbeneficescomprehended
within each diocese; little more being left to the bishop than what was
barely necessary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy. By
thisarrangementtheconditionofthesovereignwasstillworsethanithad
been before. The clergy of all the different countries of Europe were thus
formedintoasortofspiritualarmy,dispersedindifferentquarters,indeed,
but of which all the movements and operations could now be directed by

which it was quartered, and by which it was maintained, but dependent
uponaforeignsovereign,whocouldatanytimeturnitsarmsagainstthe
sovereign of that particular country, and support them by the arms of all
theotherdetachments.
1719 [22] Those arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined. In
theancientstateofEurope,beforetheestablishmentofartsandmanufac-
tures, the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of influence over
thecommonpeoplewhichthatofthegreatbaronsgavethemovertheirre-
spectivevassals,tenants,andretainers. Inthegreatlandedestateswhich
themistakenpietybothofprincesandprivatepersonshadbestowedupon
the church, jurisdictions were established of the same kind with those of
the great barons, and for the same reason. In those great landed estates, G.ed.p801
theclergy,ortheirbailiffs,couldeasilykeepthepeacewithoutthesupport
orassistanceeitherofthekingorofanyotherperson;andneithertheking
nor any other person could keep the peace there without the support and
assistance of the clergy. The jurisdictions of the clergy, therefore, in their
particular baronies or manors, were equally independent, and equally ex-
clusiveoftheauthorityoftheking’scourts,asthoseofthegreattemporal
lords. Thetenantsoftheclergywere,likethoseofthegreatbarons,almost
all tenants at will, entirely dependent upon their immediate lords, and
thereforeliabletobecalledoutatpleasureinordertofightinanyquarrel
in which the clergy might think proper to engage them. Over and above
the rents of those estates, the clergy possessed in the tithes, a very large
portion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe.
The revenues arising from both those species of rents were, the greater
part of them, paid in kind, in corn, wine, cattle poultry, etc. The quant-
ityexceededgreatlywhattheclergycouldthemselvesconsume;andthere

618 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the like surplus of their revenues, in the most profuse hospitality, and in
themostextensivecharity. Boththehospitalityandthecharityofthean-
cient clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very great. They not only
maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom, but many knights
andgentlemenhadfrequentlynoothermeansofsubsistencethanbytrav-
ellingaboutfrommonasterytomonastery,underpretenceofdevotion,but
in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the clergy. The retainers of some par-
ticularprelateswereoftenasnumerousasthoseofthegreatestlay-lords;
andtheretainersofalltheclergytakentogetherwere,perhaps,morenu-
merousthanthoseofallthelay-lords. Therewasalwaysmuchmoreunion
amongtheclergythanamongthelay-lords. Theformerwereunderareg-
ular discipline and subordination to the papal authority. The latter were
under no regular discipline or subordination, but almost always equally
jealous of one another, and of the king. Though the tenants and retainers
oftheclergy,therefore,hadbothtogetherbeenlessnumerousthanthoseof
thegreatlay-lords, andtheirtenantswereprobablymuchlessnumerous,
yet their union would have rendered them more formidable. The hospit- G.ed.p802

popular an order, its possessions, its privileges, its doctrines, necessarily
appeared sacred in the eyes of the common people, and every violation of
them, whether real or pretended, the highest act of sacrilegious wicked-
ness and profaneness. In this state of things, if the sovereign frequently

sovereign could, in such circumstances, do no better than leave him to be
tried by the ecclesiastical courts, who, for the honour of their own order,
were interested to restrain, as much as possible, every member of it from
committing enormous crimes, or even from giving occasion to such gross

1721 [24] In the state in which things were through the greater part of Europe
duringthetenth,eleventh,twelfth,andthirteenthcenturies,andforsome
time both before and after that period, the constitution of the Church of
Romemaybeconsideredasthemostformidablecombinationthateverwas
formed against the authority and security of civil government, as well as G.ed.p803
against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind, which can flourish
only where civil government is able to protect them. In that constitution
thegrossestdelusionsofsuperstitionweresupportedinsuchamannerby
the private interests of so great a number of people as put them out of all
dangerfromanyassaultofhumanreason: becausethoughhumanreason
might perhaps have been able to unveil, even to the eyes of the common
people,someofthedelusionsofsuperstition,itcouldneverhavedissolved
thetiesofprivateinterest. Hadthisconstitutionbeenattackedbynoother
enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason, it must have endured for
ever. But that immense and well-built fabric, which all the wisdom and
virtue of man could never have shaken, much less have overturned, was
by the natural course of things, first weakened, and afterwards in part
destroyed,andisnowlikely,inthecourseofafewcenturiesmore,perhaps,
tocrumbleintoruinsaltogether.
1722 [25] The gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce, the
same causes which destroyed the power of the great barons, destroyed in
thesamemanner,throughthegreaterpartofEurope,thewholetemporal
power of the clergy. In the produce of arts, manufactures, and commerce,
the clergy, like the great barons, found something for which they could
exchange theirrude produce, and thereby discoveredthe means ofspend-
ingtheirwholerevenuesupontheirownpersons,withoutgivinganycon-
siderable share of them to other people. Their charity became gradually
lessextensive,theirhospitalitylessliberalorlessprofuse. Theirretainers
became consequently less numerous, and by degrees dwindled away alto-
gether. The clergy too, like the great barons, wished to get a better rent
from their landed estates, in order to spend it, in the same manner, upon
the gratification of their own private vanity and folly. But this increase
of rent could be got only by granting leases to their tenants, who thereby
becameinagreatmeasureindependentofthem. Thetiesofinterestwhich G.ed.p804
boundtheinferiorranksofpeopletotheclergywereinthismannergradu-
ally broken and dissolved. They were even broken and dissolved sooner
thanthosewhichboundthesameranksofpeopletothegreatbarons: be-
cause the benefices of the church being, the greater part of them, much
smaller than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each bene-
fice wasmuch sooner ableto spend thewhole of itsrevenue upon hisown
person. During the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
the power of the great barons was, through the greater part of Europe, in
full vigour. But the temporal power of the clergy, the absolute command
whichtheyhadoncehadoverthegreatbodyofthepeople,wasverymuch
decayed. The power of the church was by that time very nearly reduced
620 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
through the greater part of Europe to what arose from her spiritual au-
thority; and even that spiritual authority was much weakened when it
ceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy. The
inferiorranksofpeoplenolongerlookeduponthatorder,astheyhaddone
before, as the comforters of their distress, and the relievers of their indi-
gence. On the contrary, they were provoked and disgusted by the vanity,
luxury,andexpenseofthericherclergy,whoappearedtospendupontheir
ownpleasureswhathadalwaysbeforebeenregardedasthepatrimonyof
thepoor.
1723 [26] In this situation of things, the sovereigns in the different states of
Europe endeavoured to recover the influence which they had once had
in the disposal of the great benefices of the church, by procuring to the
deansandchaptersofeachdiocesetherestorationoftheirancientrightof
electing the bishop, and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the
abbot. The re-establishing of this ancient order was the object of several
statutes enacted in England during the course of the fourteenth century,
particularlyofwhatiscalledtheStatuteofProvisors;andofthePragmatic
SanctionestablishedinFranceinthefifteenthcentury. Inordertorender
theelectionvalid,itwasnecessarythatthesovereignshouldbothconsent
toitbeforehand,andafterwardsapproveofthepersonelected;andthough
the election was still supposed to be free, he had, however, all the indir-
ect means which his situation necessarily afforded him of influencing the
clergyinhisowndominions. Otherregulationsofasimilartendencywere
establishedinotherpartsofEurope. Butthepowerofthepopeinthecol-
lation of the great benefices of the church seems, before the Reformation,
to have been nowhere so effectually and so universally restrained as in
FranceandEngland. TheConcordatafterwards,inthesixteenthcentury,
gavetothekingsofFrancetheabsoluterightofpresentingtoallthegreat, G.ed.p805
orwhatarecalledtheconsistorial,beneficesoftheGallicanChurch.
1724 [27] Since the establishment of the Pragmatic Sanction and of the Con-
cordat, the clergy of France have in general shown less respect to the de-
crees of the papal court than the clergy of any other Catholic country. In
all the disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope, they have
almost constantly taken party with the former. This independency of the
clergy of France upon the court of Rome seems to be principally founded
upon the Pragmatic Sanction and the Concordat. In the earlier periods of
the monarchy, the clergy of France appear to have been as much devoted
tothepopeasthoseofanyothercountry. WhenRobert,thesecondprince
of the Capetian race, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of
Rome,hisownservants,itissaid,threwthevictualswhichcamefromhis
table to the dogs, and refused to taste anything themselves which little
beenpollutedbythecontactofapersoninhissituation. Theyweretaught
to do so, it may very safely be presumed, by the clergy of his own domin-
ions.
1725 [28] The claim of collating to the great benefices of the church, a claim in
621 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith

many different parts of Europe, even before the time of the Reformation.
Astheclergyhadnowlessinfluenceoverthepeople,sothestatehadmore
influence over the clergy. The clergy, therefore, had both less power and
lessinclinationtodisturbthestate.
1726 [29] The authority of the Church of Rome was in this state of declension
when the disputes which gave birth to the Reformation began in Ger-
many,andsoonspreadthemselvesthrougheverypartofEurope. Thenew

Theywerepropagatedwithallthatenthusiasticzealwhichcommonlyan-

They possessed, too, in a much higher degree than their adversaries all
the arts of popularity and of gaining proselytes, arts which the lofty and
dignifiedsonsofthechurchhadlongneglectedasbeingtotheminagreat
measure useless. The reason of the new doctrines recommended them to
some, their novelty to many; the hatred and contempt of the established
clergy to a still greater number; but the zealous, passionate, and fanat-
ical,thoughfrequentlycoarseandrustic,eloquencewithwhichtheywere
almost everywhere inculcated, recommended them to by far the greatest
number.
1727 [30] The success of the new doctrines was almost everywhere so great that
the princes who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court
of Rome were by means of them easily enabled, in their own dominions,
to overturn the church, which, having lost the respect and veneration of
the inferior ranks of people, could make scarce any resistance. The court
of Rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts
of Germany, whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be
worththemanaging. Theyuniversally,therefore,establishedtheReform-
ation in their own dominions. The tyranny of Christian II and of Troll,
Archbishop of Upsala, enabled Gustavus Vasa to expel them both from
Sweden. The pope favoured the tyrant and the archbishop, and Gustavus
VasafoundnodifficultyinestablishingtheReformationinSweden. Chris-
tian II was afterwards deposed from the throne of Denmark, where his
conducthadrenderedhimasodiousasinSweden. Thepope,however,was
still disposed to favour him, and Frederick of Holstein, who had moun-
622 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ted the throne in his stead, revenged himself by following the example of
GustavusVasa. ThemagistratesofBerneandZurich,whohadnoparticu-
lar quarrel with the pope, established with great ease the Reformation in
their respective cantons, where just before some of the clergy had, by an
imposturesomewhatgrosserthanordinary,renderedthewholeorderboth
odiousandcontemptible.
1728 [31] In this critical situation of its affairs, the papal court was at sufficient
pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of France and
Spain, of whom the latter was at that time Emperor of Germany. With
their assistance it was enabled, though not without great difficulty and
much bloodshed, either to suppress altogether or to obstruct very much
the progress of the Reformation in their dominions. It was well enough
inclined, too, to be complaisant to the King of England. But from the
circumstances of the times, it could not be so without giving offence to a
stillgreatersovereign,CharlesV,KingofSpainandEmperorofGermany.
Henry VIII accordingly, though he did not embrace himself the greater G.ed.p807

wentnofurther,gavesomesatisfactiontothepatronsoftheReformation,
who having got possession of the government in the reign of his son and
successor,completedwithoutanydifficultytheworkwhichHenryVIIIhad
begun.
1729 [32] In some countries, as in Scotland, where the government was weak,
unpopular, and not very firmly established, the Reformation was strong
enoughtooverturn,notonlythechurch,butthestatelikewiseforattempt-
ingtosupportthechurch.
1730 [33] Among the followers of the Reformation dispersed in all the different
countries of Europe, there was no general tribunal which, like that of the
court of Rome, or an oecumenical council, could settle all disputes among
them, and with irresistible authority prescribe to all of them the precise
limits of orthodoxy. When the followers of the Reformation in one coun-
try, therefore, happened to differ from their brethren in another, as they
hadnocommonjudgetoappealto,thedisputecouldneverbedecided;and
manysuchdisputesaroseamongthem. Thoseconcerningthegovernment
ofthechurch,andtherightofconferringecclesiasticalbenefices,wereper-
haps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society. They
gave birth accordingly to the two principal parties of sects among the fol-
lowers of the Reformation, the Lutheran and Calvinistic sects, the only
sectsamongthemofwhichthedoctrineanddisciplinehaveeveryetbeen
establishedbylawinanypartofEurope.

ordinationamongtheclergy,gavethesovereignthedisposalofallthebish-

rendered him the real head of the church; and without depriving the
bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices within his diocese,
they, even to those benefices, not only admitted, but favoured the right of
presentation both in the sovereign and in all other lay-patrons. This sys-
temofchurchgovernmentwasfromthebeginningfavourabletopeaceand
good order, and to submission to the civil sovereign. It has never, accord-
ingly, been the occasion of any tumult or civil commotion in any country
in which it has once been established. The Church of England in particu-
larhasalwaysvaluedherself,withgreatreason,upontheunexceptionable
loyaltyofherprinciples. Undersuchagovernmenttheclergynaturallyen-

1732 [35] The followers of Zwingli, or more properly those of Calvin, on the con-
trary, bestowed upon the people of each parish, whenever the church be-
camevacant,therightofelectingtheirownpastor,andestablishedatthe
same time the most perfect equality among the clergy. The former part of
this institution, as long as it remained in vigour, seems to have been pro-
ductiveofnothingbutdisorderandconfusion,andtohavetendedequally
to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people. The latter part
seemsnevertohavehadanyeffectsbutwhatwereperfectlyagreeable.
1733 [36] Aslongasthepeopleofeachparishpreservedtherightofelectingtheir
own pastors, they acted almost always under the influence of the clergy,
and generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order. The clergy,
in order to preserve their influence in those popular elections, became, or
affected to become, many of them, fanatics themselves, encouraged fan-
aticism among the people, and gave the preference almost always to the
mostfanaticalcandidate. Sosmallamatterastheappointmentofaparish

concern for the peace of the parish, delays the settlement till this concur-

clergy, sometimes to procure, but more frequently to prevent, this concur-
rence, and the popular arts which they cultivate in order to enable them
upon such occasions to tamper more effectually, are perhaps the causes
which principally keep up whatever remains of the old fanatical spirit,
eitherintheclergyorinthepeopleofScotland.
1734 [37] The equality which the Presbyterian form of church government es-
tablishes among the clergy, consists, first, in the equality of authority or
ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and, secondly, in the equality of benefice. In all
Presbyterianchurchestheequalityofauthorityisperfect: thatofbenefice
isnotso. Thedifference,however,betweenonebeneficeandanotherissel-
domsoconsiderableascommonlytotemptthepossessorevenofthesmall

isseldomanymorethanthatindifferencewhichnaturallyarisesfromthe
consciousness that no further favours of the kind are ever to be expected.
There is scarce perhaps to be found anywhere in Europe a more learned,
decent, independent, and respectable set of men than the greater part of
thePresbyterianclergyofHolland,Geneva,Switzerland,andScotland.
1735 [38] Where the church benefices are all nearly equal, none of them can be
verygreat,andthismediocrityofbenefice,thoughitmaynodoubtbecar-
ried, too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects. Nothing but the
most exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. The
vices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and are, be-
sides, almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people. In his
ownconduct,therefore,heisobligedtofollowthatsystemofmoralswhich
the common people respect the most. He gains their esteem and affec-
tion by that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead
himtofollow. Thecommonpeoplelookuponhimwiththatkindnesswith
whichwenaturallyregardonewhoapproachessomewhattoourowncon-
dition,butwho,wethink,oughttobeinahigher. Theirkindnessnaturally
provokes his kindness. He becomes careful to instruct them, and attent-
ive to assist and relieve them. He does not even despise the prejudices
of people who are disposed to be so favourable to him, and never treats
them with those contemptuous and arrogant airs which we so often meet
with in the proud dignitaries of opulent and well-endowed churches. The
Presbyterianclergy,accordingly,havemoreinfluenceoverthemindsofthe

moderate,achairinauniversityisgenerallyabetterestablishmentthana

churchbenefices,onthecontrary,aremanyofthemveryconsiderable,the
churchnaturallydrawsfromtheuniversitiesthegreaterpartoftheirem-
inent men of letters, who generally find some patron who does himself
honour by procuring them church preferment. In the former situation we
are likely to find the universities filled with the most eminent men of let-
ters that are to be found in the country. In the latter we are likely to find
few eminent men among them, and those few among the youngest mem-
bers of the society, who are likely, too, to be drained away from it before
they can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to be of much
626 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
use to it. It is observed by Mr. de Voltaire, that Father Porrée, a Jesuit of G.ed.p811
no great eminence in the republic of letters, was the only professor they
had ever had in France whose works were worth the reading. In a coun-
try which has produced so many eminent men of letters, it must appear
somewhat singular that scarce one of them should have been a professor
in a university. The famous Gassendi was, in the beginning of his life, a
professorintheUniversityofAix. Uponthefirstdawningofhisgenius,it
wasrepresentedtohimthatbygoingintothechurchhecouldeasilyfinda
muchmorequietandcomfortablesubsistence,aswellasabettersituation
forpursuinghisstudies; andheimmediatelyfollowedtheadvice. Theob-
servation of Mr. de Voltaire may be applied, I believe, not only to France,
but to all other Roman Catholic countries. We very rarely find, in any of
them,aneminentmanofletterswhoisaprofessorinauniversity,except,
perhaps, in the professions of law and physic; professions from which the
church is not so likely to draw them. After the Church of Rome, that of
EnglandisbyfartherichestandbestendowedchurchinChristendom. In
England,accordingly,thechurchiscontinuallydrainingtheuniversitiesof
all their best and ablest members; and an old college tutor, who is known
and distinguished in Europe as an eminent man of letters, is as rarely to
be found there as in any Roman Catholic country. In Geneva, on the con-
trary,intheProtestantcantonsofSwitzerland,intheProtestantcountries
of Germany, in Holland, in Scotland, in Sweden, and Denmark, the most
eminentmenofletterswhomthosecountrieshaveproduced,have,notall
indeed,butthefargreaterpartofthem,beenprofessorsinuniversities. In
those countries the universities are continually draining the church of all
itsmosteminentmenofletters.
1737 [40] Itmay,perhaps,beworthwhiletoremarkthat,ifweexpectthepoets,
a few orators, and a few historians, the far greater part of the other em-
inentmenofletters,bothofGreeceandRome,appeartohavebeeneither
public or private teachers; generally either of philosophy or of rhetoric.
This remark will be found to hold true from the days of Lysias and Iso-
crates, of Plato and Aristotle, down to those of Plutarch and Epictetus, of
SuetoniusandQuintilian. Toimposeuponanymanthenecessityofteach- G.ed.p812
ing, year after year, any particular branch of science, seems, in reality, to
be the most effectual method for rendering him completely master of it
himself. By being obliged to go every year over the same ground, if he is
goodforanything,henecessarilybecomes,inafewyears,wellacquainted
with every part of it: and if upon any particular point he should form too
hasty an opinion one year, when he comes in the course of his lectures to
reconsiderthesamesubjecttheyearthereafter,heisverylikelytocorrect
it. As to be a teacher of science is certainly the natural employment of
a mere man of letters, so is it likewise, perhaps, the education which is
mostlikelytorenderhimamanofsolidlearningandknowledge. Theme-
diocityofchurchbeneficesnaturallytendstodrawthegreaterpartofmen

torendertheirlearningbothassolidaspossible,andasusefulaspossible.
1738 [41] The revenue of every established church, such parts of it excepted as
may arise from particular lands or manors, is a branch, it ought to be ob-
served,ofthegeneralrevenueofthestatewhichisthusdivertedtoapur-
pose very different from the defence of the state. The tithe, for example,
isarealland-tax,whichputsitoutofthepoweroftheproprietorsofland
tocontributesolargelytowardsthedefenceofthestateastheyotherwise
might be able to do. The rent of land, however, is, according to some, the
sole fund, and, according to others, the principal fund, from which, in all
greatmonarchies,theexigenciesofthestatemustbeultimatelysupplied.
Themoreofthisfundthatisgiventothechurch,theless,itisevident,can
be spared to the state. It may be laid down as a certain maxim that, all
otherthingsbeingsupposedequal,thericherthechurch,thepoorermust
necessarily be, either the sovereign on the one hand, or the people on the
other; and, in all cases, the less able must the state be to defend itself. In
several Protestant countries, particularly in all the Protestant cantons of
Switzerland,therevenuewhichancientlybelongedtotheRomanCatholic
Church,thetithesandchurchlands,hasbeenfoundafundsufficient,not
only to afford competent salaries to the established clergy, but to defray,
with little or no addition, all the other expenses of the state. The magis-
trates of the powerful canton of Berne, in particular, have accumulated
outofthesavingsfromthisfundaverylargesum,supposedtoamountto G.ed.p813
several millions, part of which is deposited in a public treasure, and part
is placed at interest in what are called the public funds of the different
indebted nations of Europe; chiefly in those of France and Great Britain.
What may be the amount of the whole expense which the church, either
of Berne, or of any other Protestant canton, costs the state, I do not pre-
tend to know. By a very exact account it appears that, in 1755, the whole
revenue of the clergy of the Church of Scotland, including their glebe or
church lands, and the rent of their manses or dwelling-houses, estimated
according to a reasonable valuation, amounted only to 68,514l.1s.5 1 d.
12
This very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence to nine hundred
andforty-fourministers. Thewholeexpenseofthechurch,includingwhat
is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of churches, and
of the manses of ministers, cannot well be supposed to exceed eighty or
eighty-fivethousandpoundsayear. ThemostopulentchurchinChristen-
dom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith, the fervour of devo-
tion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere morals in the great body
of the people, than this very poorly endowed Church of Scotland. All the
good effects, both civil and religious, which an established church can be
supposedtoproduce,areproducedbyitascompletelyasbyanyother. The
greater part of the Protestant churches of Switzerland, which in general
arenotbetterendowedthantheChurchofScotland,producethoseeffects
628 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
inastillhigherdegree. InthegreaterpartoftheProtestantcantonsthere
is not a single person to be found who does not profess himself to be of
the established church. If he professes himself to be of any other, indeed,
the law obliges him to leave the canton. But so severe, or rather indeed
sooppressivealaw,couldneverhavebeenexecutedinsuchfreecountries

1739 [42] Theproperperformanceofeveryserviceseemstorequirethatitspayor
recompense should be, as exactly as possible, proportioned to the nature
of the service. If any service is very much underpaid, it is very apt to
sufferbythemeannessandincapacityofthegreaterpartofthosewhoare
employed in it. If it is very much overpaid, it is apt to suffer, perhaps,
still more by their negligence and idleness. A man of a large revenue,
whatever may be his profession, thinks he ought to live like other men of G.ed.p814

PART THIRD
Of the Expense of Supporting the Dignity of
the Sovereign
1740 [1] Over and above the expenses necessary for enabling the sovereign to per-
form his several duties, a certain expense is requisite for the support of
hisdignity. Thisexpensevariesbothwiththedifferentperiodsofimprove-
ment,andwiththedifferentformsofgovernment.
1741 [2] In an opulent and improved society, where all the different orders of
peoplearegrowingeverydaymoreexpensiveintheirhouses,intheirfur-
niture,intheirtables,intheirdress,andintheirequipage,itcannotwell
be expected that the sovereign should alone hold out against the fashion.
He naturally, therefore, or rather necessarily, becomes more expensive in
all those different articles too. His dignity even seems to require that he
shouldbecomeso.

Conclusion of the chapter
1743 [1] The expense of defending the society, and that of supporting the dig-
nity of the chief magistrate, are both laid out for the general benefit of
thewholesociety. Itisreasonable,therefore,thattheyshouldbedefrayed
bythegeneralcontributionofthewholesociety,allthedifferentmembers
contributing,asnearlyaspossible,inproportiontotheirrespectiveabilit-
ies.
1744 [2] The expense of the administration of justice, too, may, no doubt, be
considered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society. There is no
impropriety,therefore,initsbeingdefrayedbythegeneralcontributionof G.ed.p815
thewholesociety. Thepersons,however,whogaveoccasiontothisexpense
arethosewho,bytheirinjusticeinonewayoranother,makeitnecessary
toseekredressorprotectionfromthecourtsofjustice. Thepersonsagain
most immediately benefited by this expense are those whom the courts
of justice either restore to their rights or maintain in their rights. The
expense of the administration of justice, therefore, may very properly be
defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other, or both, of those
twodifferentsetsofpersons,accordingasdifferentoccasionsmayrequire,
thatis,bythefeesofcourt. Itcannotbenecessarytohaverecoursetothe

1746 [4] The expense of maintaining good roads and communications is, no
doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore, without any in-
justice. be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society. This
expense,however,ismostimmediatelyanddirectlybeneficialtothosewho
travelorcarrygoodsfromoneplacetoanother,andtothosewhoconsume
suchgoods. TheturnpiketollsinEngland,andthedutiescalledpeagesin
other countries, lay it altogether upon those two different sets of people,
and thereby discharge the general revenue of the society from a very con-
siderableburden.
1747 [5] The expense of the institutions for education and religious instruction
is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole society, and may, therefore,
630 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
withoutinjustice,bedefrayedbythegeneralcontributionofthewholeso-
ciety. This expense, however, might perhaps with equal propriety, and
even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those who receive
the immediate benefit of such education and instruction, or by the volun-
tarycontribution ofthosewho thinktheyhave occasionforeither theone
ortheother.
1748 [6] Whentheinstitutionsorpublicworkswhicharebeneficialtothewhole
society either cannot be maintained altogether, or are not maintained al-
together by the contribution of such particular members of the society as

revenue of the society, over and above defraying the expense of defend-
ingthesociety,andofsupportingthedignityofthechiefmagistrate,must
make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of revenue. The
sources of this general or public revenue I shall endeavour to explain in
thefollowingchapter.

1752 [3] The revenue of a Tartar or Arabian chief consists in profit. It arises
principallyfromthemilkandincreaseofhisownherdsandflocks,ofwhich
he himself superintends the management, and is the principal shepherd
or herdsman of his own horde or tribe. It is, however, in this earliest and
rudest state of civil government only that profit has ever made the prin-
cipalpartofthepublicrevenueofamonarchialstate.
1753 [4] Small republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from
the profit of mercantile projects. The republic of Hamburg is said to do so
from the profits of a public wine cellar and apothecary’s shop1. The state G.ed.p818

cannot be very great of which the sovereign has leisure to carry on the
trade of a wine merchant or apothecary. The profit of a public bank has
been a source of revenue to more considerable states. It has been so not
only to Hamburg, but to Venice and Amsterdam. A revenue of this kind
has even by some people been thought not below the attention of so great
an empire as that of Great Britain. Reckoning the ordinary dividend of
the Bank of England at five and a half per cent and its capital at ten mil-
lions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds, the net annual profit,
after paying the expense of management, must amount, it is said, to five
hundred and ninety-two thousand nine hundred pounds. Government, it
is pretended, could borrow this capital at three per cent interest, and by
taking the management of the bank into its own hands, might make a
clearprofitoftwohundredandsixty-ninethousandfivehundredpoundsa

ButwhethersuchagovernmentasthatofEngland-which,whatevermay

1754 [5] The post office is properly a mercantile project. The government ad-
vances the expense of establishing the different offices, and of buying or
hiring the necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid with a large profit
by the duties upon what is carried. It is perhaps the only mercantile pro-
ject which has been successfully managed by, I believe, every sort of gov-
ernment. Thecapitaltobeadvancedisnotveryconsiderable. Thereisno

agents of a prince regard the wealth of their master as inexhaustible; are
careless at what price they buy; are careless at what price they sell; are G.ed.p819
careless at what expense they transport his goods from one place to an-
other. Those agents frequently live with the profusion of princes, and

teen years after their date, and in the meantime made transferable from

tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the province to another, it
raised a moderate revenue, which went a considerable way towards de-
fraying an annual expense of about 4,500l. the whole ordinary expense of
that frugal and orderly government. The success of an expedient of this
kind must have depended upon three different circumstances; first, upon
the demand for some other instrument of commerce besides gold and sil-
ver money; or upon the demand for such a quantity of consumable stock
as could not be had without sending abroad the greater part of their gold

moderation with which it was used, the whole value of the paper bills of

been necessary for carrying on their circulation had there been no paper
bills of credit. The same expedient was upon different occasions adopted
by several other American colonies: but, from want of this moderation, it
produced, in the greater part of them, much more disorder than conveni-
ency.

1763 [14] War and the preparation for war are the two circumstances which in
modern times occasion the greater part of the necessary expense of all
great states. But in the ancient republics of Greece and Italy every cit-
izenwasasoldier,whobothservedandpreparedhimselfforserviceathis

any very considerable expense to the state. The rent of a very moderate

1764 [15] In the ancient monarchies of Europe, the manners and customs of the
timessufficientlyPreparedthegreatbodyofthepeopleforwar;andwhen
they took the field, they were, by the condition of their feudal tenures, to
635 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
be maintained either at their own expense, or at that of their immediate
lords,withoutbringinganynewchargeuponthesovereign. Theotherex-
penses of government were, the greater part of them, very moderate. The
administration of justice, it has been shown, instead of being a cause of
expense, was a source of revenue. The labour of the country people, for
threedaysbeforeandforthreedaysafterharvest,wasthoughtafundsuf-
ficient for making and maintaining all the bridges, highways, and other
publicworkswhichthecommerceofthecountrywassupposedtorequire.
In those days the principal expense of the sovereign seems to have con-
sisted in the maintenance of his own family and household. The officers
of his household, accordingly, were then the great officers of state. The
lord treasurer received his rents. The lord steward and lord chamberlain G.ed.p822
looked after the expense of his family. The care of his stables was com-
mitted to the lord constable and the lord marshal. His houses were all
builtintheformofcastles,andseemtohavebeentheprincipalfortresses
which he possessed. The keepers of those houses or castles might be con-
sidered as a sort of military governors. They seem to have been the only
military officers whom it was necessary to maintain in time of peace. In
thesecircumstancestherentofagreatlandedestatemight,uponordinary
occasions,verywelldefrayallthenecessaryexpensesofgovernment.
1765 [16] In the present state of the greater part of the civilised monarchies of
Europe, the rent of all the lands in the country, managed as they prob-
ably would be if they all belonged to one proprietor, would scarce perhaps
amount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people even in
peaceable times. The ordinary revenue of Great Britain, for example, in-
cludingnotonlywhatisnecessaryfordefrayingthecurrentexpenseofthe
year,butforpayingtheinterestofthepublicdebts,andforsinkingapart
of the capital of those debts, amounts to upwards of ten millions a year.
Buttheland-tax,atfourshillingsinthepound,fallsshortoftwomillionsa

only of the rent of all the land, but of that of all the houses, and of the in-
terestofallthecapitalstockofGreatBritain,thatpartofitonlyexcepted
which is either let to the public, or employed as farming stock in the cul-
tivation of land. A very considerable part of the produce of this tax arises
from the rent of houses, and the interest of capital stock. The land-tax of
the city of London, for example, at four shillings in the pound, amounts
to123,399l.6s.7d.ThatofthecityofWestminster,to63,092l.1s.5d.Thatof
the palaces of Whitehall and St. James’s, to 30,754l.6s.3d. A certain pro-
portion of the land-tax is in the same manner assessed upon all the other
cities and towns corporate in the kingdom, and arises almost altogether,
eitherfromtherentofhouses,orfromwhatissupposedtobetheinterest
of trading and capital stock. According to the estimation, therefore, by
which Great Britain is rated to the land-tax, the whole mass of revenue
arisingfromtherentofallthelands,fromthatofallthehouses,andfrom
the interest of all the capital stock, that part of it only excepted which is
636 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
either lent to the public, or employed in the cultivation of land, does not
exceed ten millions sterling a year, the ordinary revenue which govern-
ment levies upon the people even in peaceable times. The estimation by
whichGreatBritainisratedtotheland-taxis,nodoubt,takingthewhole
kingdom at an average, very much below the real value; though in sev- G.ed.p823
eral particular counties and districts it is said to be nearly equal to that
value. Therentofthelandsalone,exclusivelyofthatofhouses,andofthe
interest of stock, has by many people been estimated at twenty millions,
an estimation made in a great measure at random, and which, I appre-
hend,isaslikelytobeaboveasbelowthetruth. ButifthelandsofGreat
Britain, in the present state of their cultivation, do not afford a rent of
morethantwentymillionsayear,theycouldnotwellaffordthehalf,most
probably not the fourth part of that rent, if they all belonged to a single
proprietor, and were put under the negligent, expensive, and oppressive
management of his factors and agents. The crown lands of Great Britain
do not at present afford the fourth part of the rent which could probably
be drawn from them if they were the property of private persons. If the
crown lands were more extensive, it is probable they would be still worse
managed.
1766 [17] The revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is
in proportion, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. The whole
annualproduceofthelandofeverycountry, ifweexceptwhatisreserved
for seed, is either annually consumed by the great body of the people, or
exchanged for something else that is consumed by them. Whatever keeps
down the produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to keeps
down the revenue of the great body of the people still more than it does
that of the proprietors of land. The rent of land, that portion of the pro-
ducewhichbelongstotheproprietors,isscarceanywhereinGreatBritain
supposed to be more than a third part of the whole produce. If the land
which in one state of cultivation affords a rent of ten millions sterling a
year would in another afford a rent of twenty millions, the rent being, in
both cases, supposed a third part of the produce, the revenue of the pro-
prietors would be less than it otherwise might be by ten millions a year
only; buttherevenueofthegreatbodyofthepeoplewouldbelessthanit
otherwise might be by thirty millions a year, deducting only what would
be necessary for seed. The population of the country would be less by
the number of people which thirty millions a year, deducting always the
seed, could maintain according to the particular mode of living and ex-
pense which might take place in the different ranks of men among whom
theremainderwasdistributed.
1767 [18] Though there is not at present, in Europe, any civilised state of any
kind which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of G.ed.p824
lands which are the property of the state, yet in all the great monarch-
ies of Europe there are still many large tracts of land which belong to the
crown. They are generally forest; and sometimes forest where, after trav-
637 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
elling several miles, you will scarce find a single tree; a mere waste and
loss of country in respect both of produce and population. In every great
monarchyofEuropethesaleofthecrownlandswouldproduceaverylarge
sum of money, which, if applied to the payment of the public debts, would
deliverfrommortgageamuchgreaterrevenuethananywhichthoselands
have ever afforded to the crown. In countries where lands, improved and
cultivated very highly, and yielding at the time of sale as great a rent as
can easily be got from them, commonly sell at thirty years’ purchase, the
unimproved, uncultivated, and low-rented crown lands might well be ex-
pected to sell at forty, fifty, or sixty years’ purchase. The crown might
immediately enjoy the revenue which this great price would redeem from
mortgage. In the course of a few years it would probably enjoy another
revenue. Whenthecrownlandshadbecomeprivateproperty,theywould,
in the course of a few years, become well improved and well cultivated.
Theincreaseoftheirproducewouldincreasethepopulationofthecountry
by augmenting the revenue and consumption of the people. But the rev-
enuewhichthecrownderivesfromthedutiesofcustomsandexcisewould
necessarilyincreasewiththerevenueandconsumptionofthepeople.
1768 [19] The revenue which, in any civilised monarchy, the crown derives from
thecrownlands,thoughitappearstocostnothingtoindividuals,inreality
costsmoretothesocietythanperhapsanyotherequalrevenuewhichthe
crown enjoys. It would, in all cases, be for the interest of the society to
replace this revenue to the crown by some other equal revenue, and to
divide the lands among the people, which could not well be done better,
perhaps,thanbyexposingthemtopublicsale.
1769 [20] Lands for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence- parks, gardens,
publicwalks,etc.,possessionswhichareeverywhereconsideredascauses
of expense, not as sources of revenue- seem to be the only lands which, in
agreatandcivilisedmonarchy,oughttobelongtothecrown.
1770 [21] Public stock and public lands, therefore, the two sources of revenue
whichmaypeculiarlybelongtothesovereignorcommonwealth,beingboth
improperandinsufficientfundsfordefrayingthenecessaryexpenseofany
great and civilised state, it remains that this expense must, the greater
part of it, be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another; the people contrib-
uting a part of their own private revenue in order to make up a public
revenuetothesovereignorcommonwealth.

PART THIRD
G.ed.p825
Of Taxes
1771 [1] The private revenue of individuals, it has been shown in the first book of
this Inquiry, arises ultimately from three different sources: Rent, Profit,
andWages. Everytaxmustfinallybepaidfromsomeoneorotherofthose
three different sorts of revenue, or from all of them indifferently. I shall
endeavour to give the best account I can, first, of those taxes which, it is
intended, should fall upon rent; secondly, of those which, it is intended,
should fall upon profit; thirdly, of those which, it is intended, should fall
upon wages; and, fourthly, of those which, it is intended, should fall in-
differently upon all those three different sources of private revenue. The
particular consideration of each of these four different sorts of taxes will
divide the second part of the present chapter into four articles, three of
which will require several other subdivisions. Many of those taxes, it will
appear from the following review, are not finally paid from the fund, or
sourceofrevenue,uponwhichitwasintendedtheyshouldfall.
1772 [2] BeforeIenterupontheexaminationofparticulartaxes,itisnecessary

1773 [3] I. The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support
of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective
abilities;thatis,inproportiontotherevenuewhichtheyrespectivelyenjoy
under the protection of the state. The expense of government to the indi-
viduals of a great nation is like the expense of management to the joint
tenantsofagreatestate,whoareallobligedtocontributeinproportionto

1774 [4] II. Thetaxwhicheachindividualisboundtopayoughttobecertain,and
not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity
to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every
otherperson. Whereitisotherwise,everypersonsubjecttothetaxisput
more or less in the power of the tax-gathered, who can either aggravate
639 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the tax upon any obnoxious contributor, or extort, by the terror of such
aggravation, some present or perquisite to himself. The uncertainty of G.ed.p826
taxation encourages the insolence and favours the corruption of an order
ofmenwhoarenaturallyunpopular,evenwheretheyareneitherinsolent
norcorrupt. Thecertaintyofwhateachindividualoughttopayis, intax-
ation, a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of
inequality, it appears, I believe, from the experience of all nations, is not
nearsogreatanevilasaverysmalldegreeofuncertainty.

rentoflandorofhouses,payableatthesametermatwhichsuchrentsare
usually paid, is levied at the time when it is most likely to be convenient
for the contributor to pay; or, when he is most likely to have wherewithal
to pay. Taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are
all finally paid by the consumer, and generally in a manner that is very
convenient for him. He pays them by little and little, as he has occasion
to buy the goods. As he is at liberty, too, either to buy, or not to buy, as
he pleases, it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable
inconveniencyfromsuchtaxes.
1776 [6] IV. Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep
out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what
it brings into the public treasury of the state. A tax may either take out
or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings
into the public treasury, in the four following ways. First, the levying of
it may require a great number of officers, whose salaries may eat up the
greater part of the produce of the tax, and whose perquisites may impose
another additional tax upon the people. Secondly, it may obstruct the in-
dustrythepeople,anddiscouragethemfromapplyingtocertainbranches
of business which might give maintenance and unemployment to great
multitudes. While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish, or
perhaps destroy, some of the funds which might enable them more easily

tunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax, it

injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling. But the penalties

certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing
toredeemhimselffromit. Itisinsomeoneorotherofthesefourdifferent
ways that taxes are frequently so much more burdensome to the people

1777 [7] The evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recom-
mendedthemmoreorlesstotheattentionofallnations. Allnationshave
endeavoured, to the best of their judgment, to render their taxes as equal
as they could contrive; as certain, as convenient to the contributor, both
in the time and in the mode of payment, and, in proportion to the rev-
enuewhichtheybroughttotheprince,aslittleburdensometothepeople.

ARTICLE I
TaxesuponRent
TaxesupontheRentofLand
1778 [1] A tax upon the rent of land may either every district being valued at a
certain rent, be imposed according to a certain canon, which valuation is
notafterwardstobealtered, oritmaybeimposedinsuchamannerasto
vary with every variation in the real rent of the land, and to rise or fall
withtheimprovementordeclensionofitscultivation.
1779 [2] Aland-taxwhich,likethatofGreatBritain,isassesseduponeachdis-
trict according to a certain invariable canon, though it should be equal
at the timeof its first establishment, necessarily becomes unequalin pro-
cess of time, according to the unequal degrees of improvement or neglect
in the cultivation of the different parts of the country. In England, the
valuationaccordingtowhichthedifferentcountriesandparisheswereas-
sessed to the land-tax by the 4th of William and Mary was very unequal
even at its first establishment. This tax, therefore, so far offends against
the first of the four maxims above mentioned. It is perfectly agreeable to
the other three. It is perfectly certain. The time of payment for the tax,
being the same as that for the rent, is as convenient as it can be to the
contributorthoughthelandlordisinallcasestherealcontributor,thetax
is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to
allow it in the payment of the rent. This tax is levied by a much smal-
641 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ler number of officers than any other which affords nearly the same rev-
enue. Asthetax uponeachdistrictdoes not risewiththerise oftherent,
thesovereigndoesnotshareintheprofitsofthelandlord’simprovements.
Thoseimprovementssometimescontribute,indeed,tothedischargeofthe
other landlords of the district. But the aggravation of the tax which may
sometimes occasion upon a particular estate is always so very small that
itnevercandiscouragethoseimprovements,norkeepdowntheproduceof
the land below what it would otherwise rise to. As it has no tendency to
diminish the quantity, it can have none to raise the price of that produce.
It does not obstruct the industry of the people. It subjects the landlord to G.ed.p829
nootherinconveniencybesidestheunavoidableoneofpayingthetax.
1780 [3] The advantage, however, which the landlord has derived from the in-
variable constancy of the valuation by which all the lands of Great Bri-
tainareratedtotheland-tax,hasbeenprincipallyowingtosomecircum-
stancesaltogetherextraneoustothenatureofthetax.
1781 [4] It has been owing in part to the great prosperity of almost every part
of the country, the rents of almost all the estates of Great Britain having,
sincethetimewhenthisvaluationwasfirstestablished, beencontinually
rising, and scarce any of them having fallen. The landlords, therefore,
have almost all gained the difference between the tax which they would
have paid according to the present rent of their estates, and that which
theyactuallypayaccordingtotheancientvaluation. Hadthestateofthe
countrybeendifferent,hadrentsbeengraduallyfallinginconsequenceof
thedeclensionofcultivation,thelandlordswouldalmostallhavelostthis
difference. In the state of things which has happened to take place since
the revolution, the constancy of the valuation has been advantageous to
the landlord and hurtful to the sovereign. In a different state of things it
might have been advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the land-
lord.
1782 [5] As the tax is made payable in money, so the valuation of the land is
expressed in money. Since the establishment of this valuation the value
of silver has been pretty uniform, and there has been no alteration in the
standard of the coin either as to weight or fineness. Had silver risen con-
siderably in its value, as it seems to have done in the course of the two
centuries which preceded the discovery of the mines of America, the con-
stancyofthevaluationmighthaveprovedveryoppressivetothelandlord.
Had silver fallen considerably in its value, as it certainly did for about a
century at least after the discovery of those mines, the same constancy
of valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the revenue of
the sovereign. Had any considerable alteration been made in the stand-
ard of the money, either by sinking the same quantity of silver to a lower
denomination, or by raising it to a higher; had an ounce of silver, for ex-
ample,insteadofbeingcoinedintofiveshillingsandtwopence,beencoined
either into pieces which bore so low a denomination as two shillings and
sevenpence, or into pieces which bore so high a one as ten shillings and
642 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
fourpence,itwouldintheonecasehavehurttherevenueoftheproprietor,
intheotherthatofthesovereign.
1783 [6] Incircumstances,therefore,somewhatdifferentfromthosewhichhave
actually taken place, this constancy of valuation might have been a very
great inconveniency, either to the contributors, or to the commonwealth. G.ed.p830
In the course of ages such circumstances, however, must, at some time or
other, happen. But though empires, like all the other works of men, have
all hitherto proved mortal, yet every empire aims at immortality. Every
constitution, therefore, which it is meant should be as permanent as the
empire itself, ought to be convenient, not in certain circumstances only,
butinallcircumstances;oroughttobesuited,nottothosecircumstances
which are transitory, occasional, or accidental, but to those which are ne-
cessaryandthereforealwaysthesame.
1784 [7] A tax upon the rent of land which varies with every variation of the
rent, or which rises and falls according to the improvement or neglect of
cultivation, is recommended by that sect of men of letters in France who
call themselves The Economists as the most equitable of all taxes. All
taxes,theypretend,fallultimatelyupontherentofland,andoughtthere-
fore to be imposed equally upon the fund which must finally pay them.
That all taxes ought to fall as equally as possible upon the fund which
mustfinallypaythemiscertainlytrue. Butwithoutenteringintothedis-
agreeablediscussionofthemetaphysicalargumentsbywhichtheysupport
their very ingenious theory, it will sufficiently appear, from the following
review,whatarethetaxeswhichfallfinallyupontherentoftheland,and
whatarethosewhichfallfinallyuponsomeotherfund.
1785 [8] In the Venetian territory all the arable lands which are given in lease
to farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent4. The leases are recorded in
a public register which is kept by the officers of revenue in each province
or district. When the proprietor cultivates his own lands, they are valued
accordingtoanequitableestimation,andheisallowedadeductionofone-

1789 [12] Somelandlords,insteadofraisingtherent,takeafinefortherenewal
of the lease. This practice is in most cases the expedient of a spendthrift,
whoforasumofreadymoneysellsafuturerevenueofmuchgreatervalue.
It is in most cases, therefore, hurtful to the landlords. It is frequently
hurtful to the tenant, and it is always hurtful to the community. It fre-
quently takes from the tenant so great a part of his capital, and thereby
diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land, that he finds it more
difficult to pay a small rent than it would otherwise have been to pay a
great one. Whatever diminishes his ability to cultivate, necessarily keeps
down, below what it would otherwise have been, the most important part
of the revenue of the community. By rendering the tax upon such fines a

one, this species of rent might be valued rather high, and consequently

1791 [14] Some landlords, instead of a rent in money, require a rent in kind, in
corn,cattle,poultry,wine,oil,etc.;others,again,requirearentinservice.
Such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial to the
landlord. They either take more or keep more out of the pocket of the
former than they put into that of the latter. In every country where they

His successful ones contribute to the improvement and better cultivation
of the whole country. It might be of importance, however, that the abate-

If the landlords should, the greater part of them, be tempted to farm the
whole of their own lands, the country (instead of sober and industrious
tenants, who are bound by their own interest to cultivate as well as their
capital and skill will allow them) would be filled with idle and profligate
bailiffs, whose abusive management would soon degrade the cultivation
and reduce the annual produce of the land, to the diminution, not only of

1793 [16] Suchasystemofadministrationmight,perhaps,freeataxofthiskind
from any degree of uncertainty which could occasion either oppression or
inconveniency of the contributor; and might at the same time serve to in-
troduce into the common management of land such a plan or policy as
mightcontributeagooddealtothegeneralimprovementandgoodcultiv-
ationofthecountry.
1794 [17] The expense of levying a land-tax which varied with every variation
of the rent would no doubt be somewhat greater than that of levying one
which was already rated according to a fixed valuation. Some additional
expensewouldnecessarilybeincurredbothbythedifferentregisteroffices

1795 [18] Thediscouragementwhichavariableland-taxofthiskindmightgiveto
the improvement of land seems to be the most important objection which
can be made to it. The landlord would certainly be less disposed to im-
provewhenthesovereign,whocontributednothingtotheexpense,wasto
shareintheprofitoftheimprovement. Eventhisobjectionmightperhaps
be obviated by allowing the landlord, before he began his improvement,
to ascertain, in conjunction with the officers of revenue, the actual value
of his lands according to the equitable arbitration of a certain number of
landlordsandfarmersintheneighborhood,equallychosenbybothparties,
and by rating him according to this valuation for such a number of years
as might be fully sufficient for his complete indemnification. To draw the
attentionofthesovereigntowardstheimprovementoftheland,fromare-
gardtotheincreaseofhisownrevenue,isoneoftheprincipaladvantages
proposed by this species of land-tax. The term, therefore, allowed for the
indemnification of the landlord ought not to be a great deal longer than
what was necessary for that purpose, lest the remoteness of the interest
645 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
shoulddiscouragetoomuchthisattention. Ithadbetter,however,besome-
whattoolongthaninanyrespecttooshort. Noincitementtotheattention
of the sovereign can ever counterbalance the smallest discouragement to
that of the landlord. The attention of the sovereign can be at best but
a very general and vague consideration of what is likely to contribute to
the better cultivation of the greater part of his dominions. The attention
of the landlord is a particular and minute consideration of what is likely
to be the most advantageous application of every inch of ground upon his
estate. The principal attention of the sovereign ought to be to encourage,
byeverymeansinhispower,theattentionbothofthelandlordandofthe
farmer, by allowing both to pursue their own interest in their own way
and according to their own judgment; by giving to both the most perfect
security that they shall enjoy the full recompense of their own industry;

aged as to give, not only no discouragement, but, on the contrary, some
encouragement to the improvement of land, it does not appear likely to

1798 [21] Somestates,insteadofthesimpleandobviousexpedientofaregisterof
leases, have had recourse to the laborious and expensive one of an actual
survey and valuation of all the lands in the country. They have suspec-
ted, probably, that the lessor and lessee, in order to defraud the public
revenue,mightcombinetoconcealtherealtermsofthelease. Domesday-

from twenty to twenty-five per cent of their revenue. Ecclesiastics from
forty to forty-five per cent. The survey and valuation of Silesia was made
5[Smith]MemoiresconcernantlesDroits,etc.tomei.p.114,115,116,etc.
646 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
by order of the present king; it is said with great accuracy. According to
that valuation, the lands belonging to the Bishop of Breslaw are taxed at
twenty-five per cent of their rent. The other revenues of the ecclesiastics
ofbothreligions,atfiftypercent. ThecommanderiesoftheTeutonicorder,
and of that of Malta, at forty per cent. Lands held by a noble tenure, at
thirty-eightandone-thirdpercent. Landsheldbyabasetenure,atthirty-
fiveandone-thirdpercent.
1800 [23] The survey and valuation of Bohemia is said to have been the work
of more than a hundred years. It was not perfected till after the peace of G.ed.p835
1748,bytheordersofthepresentempressqueen6. Thesurveyoftheduchy
ofMilan,whichwasbeguninthetimeofCharlesVI,wasnotperfectedtill
after 1760. It is esteemed one of the most accurate that has ever been
made. The survey of Savoy and Piedmont was executed under the orders
ofthelateKingofSardinia7.
1801 [24] In the dominions of the King of Prussia the revenue of the church is
taxedmuchhigherthanthatoflayproprietors. Therevenueofthechurch
is,thegreaterpartofit,aburdenupontherentofland. Itseldomhappens
that any part of it is applied towards the improvement of land, or is so
employed as to contribute in any respect towards increasing the revenue
of the great body of the people. His Prussian Majesty had probably, upon
that account, thought it reasonable that it should contribute a good deal
more towards relieving the exigencies of the state. In some countries the
lands of the church are exempted from all taxes. In others they are taxed
morelightlythanotherlands. IntheduchyofMilan, thelandswhichthe
church possessed before 1575 are rated to the tax at a third only of their
value.
1802 [25] InSilesia,landsheldbyanobletenurearetaxedthreepercenthigher

be in some measure alleviated by being taxed somewhat more lightly. In
other countries, the system of taxation, instead of alleviating, aggravates
this inequality. In the dominions of the King of Sardinia, and in those

nature of government that it is not likely to be of long continuance, and

and it is applied altogether to the relief of that overcharged, which con-

Taxeswhichareproportioned,nottotheRent,buttothe

1805 [1] Taxes upon the produce of land are in reality taxes upon the rent; and

rent. Insomeveryrichlandstheproduceissogreatthattheonehalfofit

hood. The other half, or, what comes to the same thing, the value of the
other half, he could afford to pay as rent to the landlord, if there was no
tithe. But if a tenth of the produce is taken from him in the way of tithe,
he must require an abatement of the fifth part of his rent, otherwise he
cannot get back his capital with the ordinary profit. In this case the rent
of the landlord, instead of amounting to a half or five-tenths of the whole
produce,willamountonlytofour-tenthsofit. Inpoorerlands,onthecon-
trary, the produce is sometimes so small, and the expense of cultivation
so great, that it requires four-fifths of the whole produce to replace to the
farmerhiscapitalwiththeordinaryprofit. Inthiscase,thoughtherewas
no tithe, the rent of the landlord could amount to no more than one-fifth
or two-tenths of the whole produce. But if the farmer pays one-tenth of

upon that of poorer lands, it may sometimes be a tax of one-half, or of ten

1807 [3] The tithe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is
always a great discouragement both to the improvements of the landlord
and to the cultivation of the farmer. The one cannot venture to make the

1808 [4] AsthroughthegreaterpartofEuropethechurch,soinmanydifferent
countries of Asia the state, is principally supported by a land-tax, propor-
tioned, not to the rent, but to the produce of the land. In China, the prin-

1809 [5] In Asia, this sort of land-tax is said to interest the sovereign in the
improvement and cultivation of land. The sovereigns of China, those of

Egypt,aresaidaccordinglytohavebeenextremelyattentivetothemaking

from the abuse and depredation of his tax-gatherers would necessarily be
much greater. The servants of the most careless private person are, per-

prince;andapublicrevenuewhichwaspaidinkindwouldsuffersomuch
from the mismanagement of the collectors that a very small part of what

Some part of the public revenue of China, however, is said to be paid in
this manner. The mandarins and other tax-gatherers will, no doubt, find

1812 [8] Ataxupontheproduceoflandwhichisleviedinmoneymaybelevied
either according to a valuation which varies with all the variations of the
market price, or according to a fixed valuation, a bushel of wheat, for ex-
ample, being always valued at one and the same money price, whatever
may be the state of the market. The produce of a tax levied in the former
way will vary only according to the variations in the real produce of the
land, accordingtotheimprovementorneglectofcultivation. Theproduce
of a tax levied in the latter way will vary, not only according to the vari-
ations in the produce of the land, but according to both those in the value

TaxesupontheRentofHouses
1814 [1] The rent of a house may be distinguished into two parts, of which the
one may very properly be called the Building-rent; the other is commonly
calledtheGroundrent.
1815 [2] The building-rent is the interest or profit of the capital expended in
buildingthehouse. Inordertoputthetradeofabuilderuponalevelwith
othertrades,itisnecessarythatthisrentshouldbesufficient,first,topay
himthesameinterestwhichhewouldhavegotforhiscapitalifhehadlent
it upon good security; and, secondly, to keep the house in constant repair,
or,whatcomestothesamething,toreplace,withinacertaintermofyears,
the capital which had been employed in building it. The building-rent, or
the ordinary profit of building, is, therefore, everywhere regulated by the
ordinary interest of money. Where the market rate of interest is four per
cent the rent of a house which, over and above paying the ground-rent,
affords six or six and a half per cent upon the whole expense of building,
may perhaps afford a sufficient profit to the builder. Where the market
rate of interest is five per cent, it may perhaps require seven or seven
and a half per cent. If, in proportion to the interest of money, the trade
of the builder affords at any time a much greater profit than this, it will

1816 [3] Whatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what is
sufficientforaffordingthisreasonableprofitnaturallygoestotheground-
rent; and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the building
aretwo different persons, is, inmostcases, completelypaid totheformer.
This surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the house pays for
some real or supposed advantage of the situation. In country houses at
adistancefromanygreattown, wherethereisplentyofgroundtochoose G.ed.p841
upon,theground-rentisscarceanything,ornomorethanwhattheground
which the house stands upon would pay if employed in agriculture. In
country villas in the neighborhood of some great town, it is sometimes a
good deal higher, and the peculiar conveniency or beauty of situation is
therefrequentlyverywellpaidfor. Ground-rentsaregenerallyhighestin
the capital, and in those particular parts of it where there happens to be
the greatest demand for houses, whatever be the reason of that demand,
whetherfortradeandbusiness,forpleasureandsociety,orformerevanity
andfashion.
1817 [4] A tax upon house-rent, payable by the tenant and proportioned to the
whole rent of each house, could not, for any considerable time at least,
affect the building-rent. If the builder did not get his reasonable profit,
he would be obliged to quit the trade; which, by raising the demand for
building, would in a short time bring back his profit to its proper level
withthatofothertrades. Neitherwouldsuchataxfallaltogetheruponthe
ground-rent; but it would divide itself in such a manner as to fall partly
upontheinhabitantofthehouse,andpartlyupontheowneroftheground.
1818 [5] Let us suppose, for example, that a particular person judges that he
can afford for house-rent an expense of sixty pounds a year; and let us
suppose, too, that a tax of four shillings in the pound, or of one-fifth, pay-
able by the inhabitant, is laid upon house-rent. A house of sixty pounds
rent will in this case cost him seventy-two pounds a year, which is twelve
poundsmorethanhethinkshecanafford. Hewill,therefore,contenthim-
self with a worse house, or a house of fifty pounds rent, which, with the
additionaltenpoundsthathemustpayforthetax,willmakeupthesum
of sixty pounds a year, the expense which he judges he can afford; and in
order to pay the tax he will give up a part of the additional conveniency
whichhemighthavehadfromahouseoftenpoundsayearmorerent. He
willgiveup,Isay,apartofthisadditionalconveniency;forhewillseldom
be obliged to give up the whole, but will, in consequence of the tax, get a
better house for fifty pounds a year than he could have got if there had
been no tax. For as a tax of this kind by taking away this particular com-
petitor, must diminish the competition for houses of sixty pounds rent, so
itmustlikewisediminishitforthoseoffiftypoundsrent,andinthesame
manner for those of all other rents, except the lowest rent, for which it
652 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
wouldforsometimeincreasethecompetition. Buttherentsofeveryclass
of houses for which the competition was diminished would necessarily be
moreorlessreduced. Asnopartofthisreduction,however,could,forany
considerable time at least, affect the building rent, the whole of it must G.ed.p842
in the long-run necessarily fall upon the ground-rent. The final payment
of this tax, therefore, would fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house,
who, in order to pay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his
conveniency, and partly upon the owner of the ground, who, in order to
pay his share, would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue. In what
proportionthisfinalpaymentwouldbedividedbetweenthemitisnotper-
hapsveryeasytoascertain. Thedivisionwouldprobablybeverydifferent
indifferentcircumstances,andataxofthiskindmight,accordingtothose
different circumstances, affect very unequally both the inhabitant of the
houseandtheowneroftheground.
1819 [6] Theinequalitywithwhichataxofthiskindmightfallupontheowners
of different ground-rents would arise altogether from the accidental in-
equality of this division. But the inequality with which it might fall upon
theinhabitantsofdifferenthouseswouldarisenotonlyfromthis,butfrom
another cause. The proportion of the expense of house-rent to the whole
expense of living is different in the different degrees of fortune. It is per-
haps highest in the highest degree, and it diminishes gradually through
theinferiordegrees,soasingeneraltobelowestinthelowestdegree. The
necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it dif-
ficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in
gettingit. Theluxuriesandvanitiesoflifeoccasiontheprincipalexpense
oftherich,andamagnificenthouseembellishesandsetsofftothebestad-
vantagealltheotherluxuriesandvanitieswhichtheypossess. Ataxupon
house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and
in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very un-
reasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to
thepublicexpense,notonlyinproportiontotheirrevenue,butsomething
morethaninthatproportion.
1820 [7] The rent of houses, though it in some respects resembles the rent of
land,isinonerespectessentiallydifferentfromit. Therentoflandispaid
for the use of a productive subject. The land which pays it produces it.
The rent of houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject. Neither
the house nor the ground which it stands upon produce anything. The
personwhopaystherent,therefore,mustdrawitfromsomeothersource
of revenue distinct from the independent of this subject. A tax upon the
rentofhouses,sofarasitfallsupontheinhabitants,mustbedrawnfrom
the same source as the rent itself, and must be paid from their revenue,
whether derived from the wages of labour, the profits of stock, or the rent
of land. So far as it falls upon the inhabitants, it is one of those taxes
whichfall,notupononeonly,butindifferentlyuponallthethreedifferent
sources of revenue, and is in every respect of the same nature as a tax
653 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
upon any other sort of consumable commodities. In general there is not, G.ed.p843
perhaps,anyonearticleofexpenseorconsumptionbywhichtheliberality
or narrowness of a man’s whole expense can be better judged of than by
his house-rent. A proportional tax upon this particular article of expense
might,perhaps,produceamoreconsiderablerevenuethananywhichhas

1821 [8] Therentofhousesmighteasilybeascertainedwithsufficientaccuracy
by a policy of the same kind with that which would be necessary for as-

no tax. A tax upon them would fall altogether upon the proprietor, who

1822 [9] Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent
ofhouses. Ataxuponground-rentswouldnotraisetherentsofhouses. It

the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there
accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found. As the

oughttopaynotax.
1823 [10] Both ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of rev-
enuewhichtheowner,inmanycases,enjoyswithoutanycareorattention

order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby
begiventoanysortofindustry. Theannualproduceofthelandandlabour

ary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can
bestbeartohaveapeculiartaximposeduponthem.
1824 [11] Ground-rents seem, in this respect, a more proper subject of peculiar
taxation than even the ordinary rent of land. The ordinary rent of land
is,inmanycases,owingpartlyatleasttotheattentionandgoodmanage-
ment of the landlord. A very heavy tax might discourage too, much this
attention and good management. Ground-rents, so far as they exceed the
ordinary rent of land, are altogether owing to the good government of the
sovereign,which,byprotectingtheindustryeitherofthewholepeople,or
of the inhabitants of some particular place, enables them to pay so much

that a fund which owes its existence to the good government of the state
should be taxed peculiarly, or should contribute something more than the

1825 [12] Though, in many different countries of Europe, taxes have been im-

taxes have, probably, found some difficulty in ascertaining what part of

valuation,accordingtowhicheachdifferentparishanddistrictisassessed

it still continues to be so. Through the greater part of the kingdom this
tax falls still more lightly upon the rent of houses than upon that of land.

in most cases, amount to more than a third of the building-rent, perhaps
of the whole rent. The valuation, indeed, according to which the houses
are rated, though very unequal, is said to be always below the real value.
When a house is rebuilt, improved, or enlarged, there is a new valuation,
andthetaxisratedaccordingly.
1828 [15] ThecontriversoftheseveraltaxeswhichinEnglandhave,atdifferent
times, been imposed upon houses, seem to have imagined that there was
some great difficulty in ascertaining, with tolerable exactness, what was
the real rent of every house. They have regulated their taxes, therefore,
accordingtosomemoreobviouscircumstances,suchastheyhadprobably
imaginedwould,inmostcases,bearsomeproportiontotherent.
1829 [16] The first tax of this kind was hearth-money, or a tax of two shillings
upon every hearth. In order to ascertain how many hearths were in the G.ed.p846
house, it was necessary that the tax-gatherer should enter every room in
it. This odious visit rendered the tax odious. Soon after the revolution,
therefore,itwasabolishedasabadgeofslavery.
1830 [17] Thenexttaxofthiskindwasataxoftwoshillingsuponeverydwelling-

house with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight shillings. This tax

of one shilling upon every house in Scotland, lays a duty upon every win-

four maxims above mentioned. They do not seem to offend much against
anyoftheotherthree.
1833 [20] The natural tendency of the window-tax, and of all other taxes upon
houses, is to lower rents. The more a man pays for the tax, the less, it
is evident, he can afford to pay for the rent. Since the imposition of the

ARTICLE II
TaxesuponProfit,orupontheRevenuearisingfrom
Stock
1834 [1] The revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into two
parts;thatwhichpaystheinterest,andwhichbelongstotheownerofthe
stock,andthatsurpluspartwhichisoverandabovewhatisnecessaryfor
payingtheinterest.
1835 [2] This latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly. It
is the compensation, and in most cases it is no more than a very moder-
ate compensation, for the risk and trouble of employing the stock. The
employermusthavethiscompensation, otherwisehecannot, consistently
with his own interest, continue the employment. If he was taxed directly,
therefore, in proportion to the whole profit, he would be obliged either to
raisetherateofhisprofit,ortochargethetaxupontheinterestofmoney;
thatis,topaylessinterest. Ifheraisedtherateofhisprofitinproportion
to the tax, the whole tax, though it might be advanced by him, would be
finallypaidbyoneorotheroftwodifferentsetsofpeople,accordingtothe
different ways in which he might employ the stock of which he had the
management. If he employed it as a farming stock in the cultivation of
land, he could raise the rate of his profit only by retaining a greater por-
tion,or,whatcomestothesamething,thepriceofagreaterportionofthe
produce of the land; and as this could be done only by a reduction of rent,
657 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
thefinalpaymentofthetaxwouldfalluponthelandlord. Ifheemployedit
asamercantileormanufacturingstock,hecouldraisetherateofhisprofit
only by raising the price of his goods; in which case the final payment of
thetaxwouldfallaltogetherupontheconsumersofthosegoods. Ifhedid

ofthetaxwouldinthiscasefallultimatelyupontheinterestofmoney. So
farashecouldnotrelievehimselffromthetaxintheoneway,hewouldbe
obligedtorelievehimselfintheother.
1836 [3] The interest of money seems at first sight a subject equally capable of
being taxed directly as the rent of land. Like the rent of land, it is a net
producewhichremainsaftercompletelycompensatingthewholeriskand
troubleofemployingthestock. Asataxupontherentoflandcannotraise G.ed.p848
rents; because the net produce which remains after replacing the stock
of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit, cannot be greater after
the tax than before it, so, for the same reason, a tax upon the interest of
moneycouldnotraisetherateofinterest;thequantityofstockormoneyin
the country, like the quantity of land, being supposed to remain the same
afterthetaxasbeforeit. Theordinaryrateofprofit,ithasbeenshownin
the first book, is everywhere regulated by the quantity of stock to be em-
ployedinproportiontothequantityoftheemployment,orofthebusiness
which must be done by it. But the quantity of the employment, or of the
business to be done by stock, could neither be increased nor diminished
by any tax upon the interest of money. If the quantity of the stock to be
employed, therefore, was neither increased nor diminished by it, the or-
dinaryrateofprofitwouldnecessarilyremainthesame. Buttheportionof
thisprofitnecessaryforcompensatingtheriskandtroubleoftheemployer
wouldlikewiseremainthesame,thatriskandtroublebeinginnorespect
altered. Theresidue,therefore,thatportionwhichbelongstotheownerof
thestock,andwhichpaystheinterestofmoney,wouldnecessarilyremain
thesametoo. Atfirstsight,therefore,theinterestofmoneyseemstobea
subjectasfittobetaxeddirectlyastherentofland.
1837 [4] There are, however, two different circumstances which render the in-
terestofmoneyamuchlesspropersubjectofdirecttaxationthantherent
ofland.
1838 [5] First,thequantityandvalueofthelandwhichanymanpossessescan
neverbeasecret,andcanalwaysbeascertainedwithgreatexactness. But
thewholeamountofthecapitalstockwhichhepossessesisalmostalways
a secret, and can scarce ever be ascertained with tolerable exactness. It
is liable, besides, to almost continual variations. A year seldom passes
away, frequently not a month, sometimes scarce a single day, in which it
does not rise or fall more or less. An inquisition into every man’s private
circumstances,andaninquisitionwhich,inordertoaccommodatethetax
658 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
tothem,watchedoverallthefluctuationsofhisfortunes,wouldbeasource
ofsuchcontinualandendlessvexationasnopeoplecouldsupport.
1839 [6] Secondly, land is a subject which cannot be removed; whereas stock
easilymay. Theproprietoroflandisnecessarilyacitizenoftheparticular
countryinwhichhisestatelies. Theproprietorofstockisproperlyacitizen
of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country. G.ed.p849
He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a
vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and
wouldremovehisstocktosomeothercountrywherehecouldeithercarry
on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease. By removing his
stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in
the country which he left. Stock cultivates land; stock employs labour. A
taxwhichtendedtodriveawaystockfromanyparticularcountrywouldso
fartendtodryupeverysourceofrevenuebothtothesovereignandtothe
society. Notonlytheprofitsofstock,buttherentoflandandthewagesof
labourwouldnecessarilybemoreorlessdiminishedbyitsremoval.
1840 [7] The nations, accordingly, who have attempted to tax the revenue
arisingfromstock,insteadofanysevereinquisitionofthiskind,havebeen
obligedtocontentthemselveswithsomeveryloose,and,therefore,moreor
lessarbitrary,estimation. Theextremeinequalityanduncertaintyofatax
assessed in this manner can be compensated only by its extreme modera-
tion,inconsequenceofwhicheverymanfindshimselfratedsoverymuch
below his real revenue that he gives himself little disturbance though his
neighbourshouldberatedsomewhatlower.
1841 [8] By what is called the land-tax in England, it was intended that stock
should be taxed in the same proportion as land. When the tax upon land
was at four shillings in the pound, or at one-fifth of the supposed rent, it
was intended that stock should be taxed at one-fifth of the supposed in-
terest. Whenthepresentannualland-taxwasfirstimposed,thelegalrate
ofinterestwassixpercent. Everyhundredpoundsstock,accordingly,was
supposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings, the fifth part of six pounds.
Sincethelegalrateofinteresthasbeenreducedtofivepercenteveryhun-
dred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at twenty shillings only. The
sum to be raised by what is called the land-tax was divided between the
country and the principal towns. The greater part of it was laid upon the
country; and of what was laid upon the towns, the greater part was as-
sessed upon the houses. What remained to be assessed upon the stock or G.ed.p850
tradeofthetowns(forthestockuponthelandwasnotmeanttobetaxed)
was very much below the real value of that stock or trade. Whatever in-
equalities, therefore, theremightbeintheoriginalassessmentgavelittle
disturbance. Every parish and district still continues to be rated for its
land, its houses, and its stock, according to the original assessment; and
the almost universal prosperity of the country, which in most places has
raised very much the value of all these, has rendered those inequalities
of still less importance now. The rate, too, upon each district continuing
659 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
alwaysthesame,theuncertaintyofthistaxsofarasitmightbeassessed
upon the stock of any individual, has been very much diminished, as well
as rendered of much less consequence. If the greater part of the lands
of England are not rated to the land-tax at half their actual value, the
greaterpartofthestockofEnglandis,perhaps,scarceratedatthefiftieth

puts annually into the public coffer a certain sum of money which he de-
clares upon oath to be one-fourth per cent of all that he possesses, but
without declaring what it amounts to, or being liable to any examination
upon that subject. This tax is generally supposed to be paid with great
fidelity. In a small republic, where the people have entire confidence in
theirmagistrates,areconvincedofthenecessityofthetaxforthesupport

fellow-citizens will deceive them. At Basel the principal revenue of the
state arises from a small custom upon goods exported. All the citizens
make oath that they will pay every three months all the taxes imposed
by the law. All merchants and even all innkeepers are trusted with keep-
ing themselves the account of the goods which they sell either within or
without the territory. At the end of every three months they send this ac-

and the miscarriage of their projects, they foresee, would too often be the
consequence. A sober and parsimonious people, who are strangers to all
suchprojects,donotfeelthattheyhaveoccasionforanysuchconcealment.
1846 [13] In Holland, soon after the exaltation of the late Prince of Orange to
the stadtholdership, a tax of two per cent, or the fiftieth penny, as it was
called, was imposed upon the whole substance of every citizen. Every cit-
izenassessedhimselfandpaidhistaxinthesamemannerasatHamburg,
and it was in general supposed to have been paid with great fidelity. The G.ed.p852
people had at that time the greatest affection for their new government,
which they had just established by a general insurrection. The tax was
to be paid but once, in order to relieve the state in a particular exigency.
It was, indeed, too heavy to be permanent. In a country where the mar-
ket rate of interest seldom exceeds three per cent, a tax of two per cent
amountstothirteenshillingsandfourpenceinthepounduponthehighest
net revenue which is commonly drawn from stock. It is a tax which very
few people could pay without encroaching more or less upon their capit-
als. Inaparticularexigencythepeoplemay, fromgreatpubliczeal, make
a great effort, and give up even a part of their capital in order to relieve
the state. But it is impossible that they should continue to do so for any
considerable time; and if they did, the tax would ruin them so completely
astorenderthemaltogetherincapableofsupportingthestate.
1847 [14] The tax upon stock imposed by the Land-tax Bill in England, though
it is proportioned to the capital, is not intended to diminish or take away
any part of that capital. It is meant only to be a tax upon the interest of
money proportioned to that upon the rent of land, so that when the latter
is at four shillings in the pound, the former may be at four shillings in
the pound too. The tax at Hamburg and the still more moderate tax of
Unterwald and Zurich are meant, in the same manner, to be taxes, not
upon the capital, but upon the interest or net revenue of stock. That of
Hollandwasmeanttobeataxuponthecapital.
TaxesuponasProfitofparticularEmployments
1848 [1] In some countries extraordinary taxes are imposed upon the profits of
stock, sometimes when employed in particular branches of trade, and
sometimeswhenemployedinagriculture.
1849 [2] Of the former kind are in England the tax upon hawkers and pedlars,
that upon hackney coaches and chairs, and that which the keepers of ale-
houses pay for a licence to retail ale and spirituous liquors. During the
latewar,anothertaxofthesamekindwasproposeduponshops. Thewar
havingbeenundertaken,itwassaid,indefenceofthetradeofthecountry,
the merchants, who were to profit by it, ought to contribute towards the
supportofit.
1850 [3] A tax, however, upon the profits of stock employed in any particular G.ed.p853
661 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
branch of trade can never fall finally upon the dealers (who must in all
ordinary cases have their reasonable profit, and where the competition
is free can seldom have more than that profit), but always upon the con-
sumers,whomustbeobligedtopayinthepriceofthegoodsthetaxwhich
thedealeradvances;andgenerallywithsomeovercharge.
1851 [4] A tax of this kind when it is proportioned to the trade of the dealer is
finally paid by the consumer, and occasions no oppression to the dealer.
Whenitisnotsoproportioned,butisthesameuponalldealers,thoughin
this case, too, it is finally paid by the consumer, yet it favours the great,
andoccasionssomeoppressiontothesmalldealer. Thetaxoffiveshillings
a week upon every hackney coach, and that of ten shillings a year upon
every hackney chair, so far as it is advanced by the different keepers of
such coaches and chairs, is exactly enough proportioned to the extent of
their respective dealings. It neither favours the great, nor oppresses the
smallerdealer. Thetaxoftwentyshillingsayearforalicencetosellale;of
forty shillings for a licence to sell spirituous liquors; and of forty shillings

cessarily give some advantage to the great, and occasion some oppression

ever,rendersthisinequalityoflessimportance,anditmaytomanypeople

of little ale-houses. The tax upon shops, it was intended, should be the
sameuponallshops. Itcouldnotwellhavebeenotherwise. Itwouldhave

1852 [5] What in France is called the personal taille is, perhaps, the most im- G.ed.p854
portanttaxupontheprofitsofstockemployedinagriculturethatislevied
inanypartofEurope.
1853 [6] In the disorderly state of Europe during the prevalence of the feudal
government, the sovereign was obliged to content himself with taxing
those who were too weak to refuse to pay taxes. The great lords, though
willingtoassisthimuponparticularemergencies,refusedtosubjectthem-
selves to any constant tax, and he was not strong enough to force them.
The occupiers of land all over Europe were, the greater part of them, ori-
662 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ginallybondmen. ThroughthegreaterpartofEuropetheyweregradually
emancipated. Someofthemacquiredthepropertyoflandedestateswhich
they held by some base or ignoble tenure, sometimes under the king, and
sometimes under some other great lord, like the ancient copy-holders of
England. Otherswithoutacquiringtheproperty,obtainedleasesforterms
of years of the lands which they occupied under their lord, and thus be-
came less dependent upon him. The great lords seem to have beheld the
degree of prosperity and independency which this inferior order of men
had thus come to enjoy with a malignant and contemptuous indignation,
andwillinglyconsentedthatthesovereignshouldtaxthem. Insomecoun-
triesthistaxwasconfinedtothelandswhichwereheldinpropertybyan
ignoble tenure; and, in this case, the taille was said to be real. The land-
taxestablishedbythelateKingofSardinia,andthetailleintheprovinces
ofLanguedoc,Provence,Dauphiné,andBrittany,inthegeneralityofMon-
tauban,andintheelectionsofAgenandComdom,aswellasinsomeother
districts of France, are taxes upon lands held in property by an ignoble
tenure. Inothercountriesthetaxwaslaiduponthesupposedprofitsofall
thosewhoheldinfarmorleaselandsbelongingtootherpeople,whatever
might be the tenure by which the proprietor held them; and in this case
the taille was said to be personal. In the greater part of those provinces
of France which are called the Countries of Elections the taille is of this
kind. The real taille, as it is imposed only upon a part of the lands of the
country, is necessarily an unequal, but it is not always an arbitrary tax,
though it is so upon some occasions. The personal taille, as it is intended
tobeproportionedtotheprofitsofacertainclassofpeoplewhichcanonly
beguessedat,isnecessarilybotharbitraryandunequal.
1854 [7] In France the personal taille at present (1775) annually imposed upon
the twenty generalities called the Countries of Elections amounts to
40,107,239 livres, 16 sous13. The proportion in which this sum is assessed
upon those different provinces varies from year to year according to the
reports which are made to the king’s council concerning the goodness or
badness of the crops, as well as other circumstances which may either
increase or diminish their respective abilities to pay. Each generality it
dividedintoacertainnumberofelections,andtheproportioninwhichthe
sum imposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different
elections varies likewise from year to year according to the reports made
to the council concerning their respective abilities. It seems impossible
that the council, with the best intentions, can ever proportion with toler-
able exactness either of those two assessments to the real abilities of the
province or district upon which they are respectively laid. Ignorance and
misinformationmustalways,moreorless,misleadthemostuprightcoun-

the interest of the farmers to withdraw any part of their stock from that
employment. Each farmer occupies a certain quantity of land, for which
hi pays rent. For the proper cultivation of this land a certain quantity of
stockisnecessary,andbywithdrawinganypartofthisnecessaryquantity,
thefarmerisnotlikelytobemoreabletopayeithertherentorthetax. In
order to pay the tax, it can never be his interest to diminish the quantity
ofhisproduce,norconsequentlytosupplythemarketmoresparinglythan
before. The tax, therefore, will never enable him to raise the price of his
produce so as to reimburse himself by throwing the final payment upon
the consumer. The farmer, however, must have his reasonable profit as
well as every other dealer, otherwise he must give up the trade. After
the imposition of a tax of this kind, he can get this reasonable profit only
by paying less rent to the landlord. The more he is obliged to pay in the
way of tax the less he can afford to pay in the way of rent. A tax of this

the farmer. Upon the renewal of the lease it must always fall upon the
landlord.
1856 [9] In the countries where the personal taille takes place, the farmer is
commonlyassessedinproportiontothestockwhichheappearstoemploy
in cultivation. He is, upon this account, frequently afraid to have a good
teamofhorsesoroxen, butendeavourstocultivatewiththemeanestand
mostwretchedinstrumentsofhusbandrythathecan. Suchishisdistrust
in the justice of his assessors that he counterfeits poverty, and wishes to
appear scarce able to pay anything for fear of being obliged to pay too
much. By this miserable policy he does not, perhaps, always consult his
own interest in the most effectual manner, and he probably loses more by
the diminution of his produce than he saves by that of his tax. Though,
inconsequenceofthiswretchedcultivation,themarketis,nodoubt,some-

not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the diminution of his produce,
it is still less likely to enable him to pay more rent to the landlord. The
public, the farmer, the landlord, all suffer more or less by this degraded
cultivation. Thatthepersonaltailletends,inmanydifferentways,todis- G.ed.p857

farmers and landlords, the final payment of the tax falls upon them in
theirqualityoflandlordswithoutanyretribution.
1858 [11] Taxes of so much a head upon the bondmen employed in cultivation
seem anciently to have been common all over Europe. There subsists at

uponfreemen. Thelatterispaidbythepersonsuponwhomitisimposed;
the former by a different set of persons. The latter is either altogether
arbitrary or altogether unequal, and in most cases is both the one and
the other; the former, though in some respects unequal, different slaves
being of different values, is in no respect arbitrary. Every master who
knows the number of his own slaves knows exactly what he has to pay.
Thosedifferenttaxes,however,beingcalledbythesamename,havebeen

revenue arising from land, houses, and stock. So far as it affects stock it

secondly,byrequiring,underthelikepenaltyofinvalidity,thatitshouldbe

frequently been imposed likewise upon the deeds transferring property of
all kinds from the dead to the living, and upon those transferring immov-
ablepropertyfromthelivingtotheliving,transactionswhichmighteasily
havebeentaxeddirectly.
1863 [3] The Vicesima Hereditatum, the twentieth penny of inheritances im- G.ed.p859
posed by Augustus upon the ancient Romans, was a tax upon the trans-
ferenceofpropertyfromthedeadtotheliving. DionCassius14,theauthor
who writes concerning it the least indistinctly, says that it was imposed
uponallsuccessions,legacies,anddonationsincaseofdeath,exceptupon
thosetothenearestrelationsandtothepoor.
1864 [4] Of the same kind is the Dutch tax upon successions15. Collateral suc-
cessions are taxed, according to the degree of relation, from five to thirty
percentuponthewholevalueofthesuccession. Testamentarydonations,
or legacies to collaterals, are subject to the like duties. Those from hus-
bandto wife, or fromwifeto husband, to thefiftiethpenny. TheLuctuosa
Hereditas, the mournful succession of ascendants to descendants, to the
twentieth penny only. Direct successions, or those of descendants to as-
cendants, pay no tax. The death of a father, to such of his children as live
in the same house with him, is seldom attended with any increase, and
frequentlywithaconsiderablediminutionofrevenue,bythelossofhisin-
dustry, of his office, or of some life-rent estate of which he may have been
in possession. That tax would be cruel and oppressive which aggravated
theirlossbytakingfromthemanypartofhissuccession. Itmay,however,
sometimes be otherwise with those children who, in the language of the
Roman law, are said to be emancipated; in that of the Scotch law, to be
forisfamiliated; that is, who have received their portion, have got famil-
ies of their own, and are supported by funds separate and independent of
those of their father. Whatever part of his succession might come to such
children would be a real addition to their fortune, and might therefore,
perhaps, without more inconveniency than what attends all duties of this
kind,beliabletosometax.
1865 [5] The casualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the transference of
land,bothfromthedeadtotheliving,andfromthelivingtotheliving. In

of the minority devolved to the superior without any other charge besides
themaintenanceoftheminor,andthepaymentofthewidow’sdowerwhen
there happened to be a dowager upon the land. When the minor came to
be of age, another tax, called Relief, was still due to the superior, which
generally amounted likewise to a year’s rent. A long minority, which in

brances and restores the family to their ancient splendour, could in those
times have no such effect. The waste, and not the disincumbrance of the

1867 [7] By the feudal law the vassal could not alienate without the consent of
his superior, who generally extorted a fine or composition for granting it.

son sells his land in order to remove out of the territory, he pays ten per

to have made use of, his succession is confiscated. This is over and above
all their other taxes on succession. Except bills of exchange, and some
other mercantile bills, all other deeds, bonds, and contracts are subject to
a stamp-duty. This duty, however, does not rise in proportion to the value
of the subject. All sales of land and of houses, and all mortgages upon
either, must be registered, and, upon registration, pay a duty to the state

Thesellerisalmostalwaysunderthenecessityofselling,andmust,there-
fore, take such a price as he can get. The buyer is scarce ever under the
necessity of buying, and will, therefore, only give such a price as he likes.
He considers what the land will cost him in tax and price together. The
more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he will be disposed to
give in the way of price. Such taxes, therefore, fall almost always upon a
necessitous person, and must, therefore, be frequently very cruel and op-
pressive. Taxes upon the sale of new-built houses, where the building is
soldwithouttheground,fallgenerallyuponthebuyer,becausethebuilder
must generally have his profit, otherwise he must give up the trade. If
he advances the tax, therefore, the buyer must generally repay it to him.

APPENDIX TO ARTICLES I AND II
TaxesupontheWagesofLabour
1879 [1] Thewagesoftheinferiorclassesofworkmen,Ihaveendeavouredtoshow
inthefirstbook,areeverywherenecessarilyregulatedbytwodifferentcir-
cumstances; the demand for labour, and the ordinary or average price of
provisions. The demand for labour, according as it happens to be either
increasing,stationary,ordeclining,ortorequireanincreasing,stationary,
or declining population, regulates the subsistence of the labourer, and de-
terminesinwhatdegreeitshallbe,eitherliberal,moderate,orscanty. The
ordinary or average price of provisions determines the quantity of money
whichmustbepaidtotheworkmaninordertoenablehim,oneyearwith
another, to purchase this liberal, moderate, or scanty subsistence. While
the demand for labour and the price of provisions, therefore, remain the
same, a direct tax upon the wages of labour can have no other effect than
toraisethemsomewhathigherthanthetax. Letussuppose,forexample,
thatinaparticularplacethedemandforlabourandthepriceofprovisions
were such as to render ten shillings a week the ordinary wages of labour,
and that a tax of one-fifth, or four shillings in the pound, was imposed
uponwages. Ifthedemandforlabourandthepriceofprovisionsremained
thesame,itwouldstillbenecessarythatthelabourershouldinthatplace
earn such a subsistence as could be bought only for ten shillings a week
free wages. But in order to leave him such free wages after paying such
a tax, the price of labour must in that place soon rise, not to twelve shil-
lings a week only, but to twelve and sixpence; that is, in order to enable
671 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
himtopayataxofone-fifth,hiswagesmustnecessarilysoonrise,notone-
fifthpartonly,butone-fourth. Whateverwastheproportionofthetax,the
wages of labour must in all cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in
a higher proportion. If the tax, for example, was one-tenth, the wages of
labourmustnecessarilysoonrise,notone-tenthpartonly,butone-eighth.
1880 [2] A direct tax upon the wages of labour, therefore, though the labourer
mightperhapspayitoutofhishand,couldnotproperlybesaidtobeeven
advanced by him; at least if tile demand for labour and the average price
of provisions remained the same after the tax as before it. In all such G.ed.p865
cases, not only the tax but something more than the tax would in reality
beadvancedbythepersonwhoimmediatelyemployedhim. Thefinalpay-
ment would in different cases fall upon different persons. The rise which
such a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing labour would
beadvancedbythemastermanufacturer,whowouldbothbeentitledand
obliged to charge it, with a profit, upon the price of his goods. The fi-
nal payment of this rise of wages, therefore, together with the additional
profitofthemastermanufacturer,wouldfallupontheconsumer. Therise
which such a tax might occasion in the wages of country labour would be
advanced by the farmer, who, in order to maintain the same number of
labourers as before, would be obliged to employ a greater capital. In or-
der to get back this greater capital, together with the ordinary profits of
stock,itwouldbenecessarythatheshouldretainalargerportion,orwhat
comes to the same thing, the price of a larger portion, of the produce of
the land, and consequently that he should pay less rent to the landlord.
The final payment of this rise of wages, therefore, would in this case fall
upon the landlord, together with the additional profit of the farmer who
had advanced it. In all cases a direct tax upon the wages of labour must,
inthelong-run,occasionbothagreaterreductionintherentofland,anda
greaterriseinthepriceofmanufacturedgoods,thanwouldhavefollowed
fromtheproperassessmentofasumequaltotheproduceofthetaxpartly
upontherentofland,andpartlyuponconsumablecommodities.
1881 [3] If direct taxes upon the wages of labour have not always occasioned a
proportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally oc-
casioned a considerable fall in the demand for labour. The declension of
industry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the
annualproduceofthelandandlabourofthecountry,havegenerallybeen
the effects of such taxes. In consequence of them, however, the price of
labourmustalwaysbehigherthanitotherwisewouldhavebeenintheac-
tualstateofthedemand: andthisenhancementofprice,togetherwiththe
profitofthosewhoadvanceit,mustalwaysbefinallypaidbythelandlords
andconsumers.
1882 [4] A tax upon the wages of country labour does not raise the price of the
rude produce of land in proportion to the tax, for the same reason that a
taxuponthefarmer’sprofitdoesnotraisethatpriceinthatproportion.
1883 [5] Absurd and destructive as such taxes are, however, they take place in
672 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
many countries. In France that part of the taille which is charged upon
theindustryofworkmenandday-labourersincountryvillagesisproperly G.ed.p866
ataxofthiskind. Theirwagesarecomputedaccordingtothecommonrate
ofthedistrictinwhichtheyreside,andthattheymaybeaslittleliableas
possible to any overcharge, their yearly gains are estimated at no more
than two hundred working days in the year19. The tax of each individual
is varied from year to year according to different circumstances, of which

Theyare, perhaps, inmostcountries, higher than itrequires; thepersons

1887 [1] Capitation taxes, if it is attempted to proportion them to the fortune or

1891 [5] In the capitation which has been levied in France without any inter-
ruption since the beginning of the present century, the highest orders of
people are rated according to their rank by an invariable tariff; the lower
orders of people, according to what is supposed to be their fortune, by an
assessmentwhichvariesfromyeartoyear. Theofficersoftheking’scourt,
the judges and other officers in the superior courts of justice, the officers
of the troops, etc., are assessed in the first manner. The inferior ranks of
people in the provinces are assessed in the second. In France the great
easily submit to a considerable degree of inequality in a tax which, so far
as it affects them, is not a very heavy one, but could not brook the arbit-
rary assessment of an intendant. The inferior ranks of people must, in
thatcountry,sufferpatientlytheusagewhichtheirsuperiorsthinkproper

what that assessment happened to produce, and required no compensa-
tion for the loss which the state might sustain either by those who could

who, by the indulgent execution of the law, were not forced to pay. The
moreseveregovernmentofFranceassessesuponeachgeneralityacertain
sum, which the intendant must find as he can. If any province complains
of being assessed too high, it may, in the assessment of next year, obtain
an abatement proportioned to the overcharge of the year before. But it
must pay in the meantime. The intendant, in order to be sure of finding G.ed.p869

nobility, and upon those whose privileges exempt them from the taille, is
the least considerable. The largest falls upon those subject to the taille,

1893 [7] Capitation taxes, so far as they are levied upon the lower ranks of
people, are direct taxes upon the wages of labour, and are attended with
alltheinconveniencesofsuchtaxes.

TaxesuponconsumableCommodities
1895 [1] The impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their revenue, by
anycapitation,seemstohavegivenoccasiontotheinventionoftaxesupon
consumablecommodities. Thestate, notknowinghowtotax, directlyand
proportionably, the revenue of its subjects, endeavours to tax it indirectly
bytaxingtheirexpense,which,itissupposed,willinmostcasesbenearly

sumablecommoditiesuponwhichitislaidout.
1896 [2] Consumablecommoditiesareeithernecessariesorluxuries.
1897 [3] By necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are
indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom G.ed.p870
of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the low-
est order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking,
not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very
comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through
the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed
toappearinpublicwithoutalinenshirt,thewantofwhichwouldbesup-
posed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed,
nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the
same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England.
The poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear
in public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a neces-
saryoflifetothelowestorderofmen;butnottothesameorderofwomen,
whomay,withoutanydiscredit,walkaboutbarefooted. InFrancetheyare
necessariesneithertomennortowomen,thelowestrankofbothsexesap-

and sometimes barefooted. Under necessaries, therefore, I comprehend
notonlythosethingswhichnature,butthosethingswhichtheestablished

other things I call luxuries, without meaning by this appellation to throw

support of life, and custom nowhere renders it indecent to live without

upon those articles necessarily raises their price somewhat higher than
the amount of the tax, because the dealer, who advances the tax, must
generally get it back with a profit. Such a tax must, therefore, occasion a
riseinthewagesoflabourproportionabletothisriseofprice.
1899 [5] It is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life operates exactly in
the same manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labour. The labourer,
though he may pay it out of his hand, cannot, for any considerable time
at least, be properly said even to advance it. It must always in the long-
run be advanced to him by his immediate employer in the advanced rate
of his wages. His employer, if he is a manufacturer, will charge upon the
price of his goods this rise of wages, together with a profit; so that the
final payment of the tax, together with this overcharge, will fall upon the
consumer. If his employer is a farmer, the final payment, together with a
likeovercharge,willfallupontherentofthelandlord.
1900 [6] ItisotherwisewithtaxesuponwhatIcallluxuries,evenuponthoseof
thepoor. Theriseinthepriceofthetaxedcommoditieswillnotnecessarily
occasion any rise in the wages of labour. A tax upon tobacco, for example,
though a luxury of the poor as well as of the rich, will not raise wages.
Though it is taxed in England at three times, and in France at fifteen
times its original price, those high duties seem to have no effect upon the
wages of labour. The same thing may be said of the taxes upon tea and
sugar, which in England and Holland have become luxuries of the lowest
ranksofpeople,andofthoseuponchocolate,whichinSpainissaidtohave

deed,arenotsoberandindustrious,andthedissoluteanddisorderlymight
continue to indulge themselves in the use of such commodities after this
rise of price in the same manner as before without regarding the distress
which this indulgence might bring upon their families. Such disorderly
persons, however, seldom rear up numerous families, their children gen-
erally perishing from neglect, mismanagement, and the scantiness or un-
wholesomeness of their food. If by the strength of their constitution they
survive the hardships to which the bad conduct of their parents exposes
them, yet the example of that bad conduct commonly corrupts their mor-
als,sothat,insteadofbeingusefultosocietybytheirindustry,theybecome
public nuisances by their vices and disorders. Though the advanced price

1903 [9] Taxes upon luxuries have no tendency to raise the price of any other
commodities except that of the commodities taxed. Taxes upon necessar-
ies, by raising the wages of labour, necessarily tend to raise the price of
all manufactures, and consequently to diminish the extent of their sale
and consumption. Taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the consumers
of the commodities taxed without any retribution. They fall indifferently
upon every species of revenue, the wages of labour, the profits of stock,
and the rent of land. Taxes upon necessaries, so far as they affect the la-
bouringpoor,arefinallypaid,partlybylandlordsinthediminishedrentof
theirlands,andpartlybyrichconsumers,whetherlandlordsorothers,in
theadvancedpriceofmanufacturedgoods,andalwayswithaconsiderable
overcharge. The advanced price of such manufactures as are real neces-
saries of life, and are destined for the consumption of the poor, of coarse
woollens, for example, must be compensated to the poor by a further ad-
vancement of their wages. The middling and superior ranks of people,
if they understand their own interest, ought always to oppose all taxes
upon the necessaries of life, as well as all direct taxes upon the wages of
labour. The final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether
upon themselves, and always with a considerable overcharge. They fall
heaviest upon the landlords, who always pay in a double capacity; in that
of landlords by the reduction of their rent, and in that of rich consumers
by the increase of their expense. The observation of Sir Matthew Decker,
that certain taxes are, in the price of certain goods, sometimes repeated
and accumulated four or five times, is perfectly just with regard to taxes

uponthenecessariesoflife. Inthepriceofleather, forexample, youmust

1904 [10] In Great Britain, the principal taxes upon the necessaries of life are G.ed.p874
those upon the four commodities just now mentioned, salt, leather, soap,
andcandles.
1905 [11] Salt is a very ancient and a very universal subject of taxation. It was
taxed among the Romans, and it is so at present in, I believe, every part
ofEurope. Thequantityannuallyconsumedbyanyindividualissosmall,
and may be purchased so gradually, that nobody, it seems to have been
thought, could feel very sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it. It is in
Englandtaxedatthreeshillingsandfourpenceabushel-aboutthreetimes
theoriginalpriceofthecommodity. Insomeothercountriesthetaxisstill
higher. Leather is a real necessary of life. The use of linen renders soap
such. In countries where the winter nights are long, candles are a neces-
sary instrument of trade. Leather and soap are in Great Britain taxed at
three halfpence a pound, candles at a penny; taxes which, upon the ori-
ginal price of leather, may amount to about eight or ten per cent; upon
thatofsoaptoabouttwentyorfive-and-twentypercent;anduponthatof
candles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent; taxes which, though lighter
thanthatuponsalt,arestillveryheavy. Asallthosefourcommoditiesare
real necessaries of life, such heavy taxes upon them must increase some-
whattheexpenseofthesoberandindustriouspoor,andmustconsequently
raisemoreorlessthewagesoftheirlabour.
1906 [12] In a country where the winters are so cold as in Great Britain, fuel
is, during that season, in the strictest sense of the word, a necessary of
life, not only for the purpose of dressing victuals, but for the comfortable
subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within doors;
and coals are the cheapest of all fuel. The price of fuel has so important
aninfluenceuponthatoflabourthatalloverGreatBritainmanufactures
have confined themselves principally to the coal countries, other parts of
thecountry,onaccountofthehighpriceofthisnecessaryarticle,notbeing
able to work so cheap. In some manufactures, besides, coal is a necessary
instrument of trade, as in those of glass, iron, and all other metals. If
a bounty could in any case be reasonable, it might perhaps be so upon
the transportation of coals from those parts of the country in which they
abound to those in which they are wanted. But the legislature, instead of
a bounty, has imposed a tax of three shillings and three-pence a ton upon G.ed.p875
coal carried coastways, which upon most sorts of coal is more than sixty
per cent of the original price at the coal-pit. Coals carried either by land
orbyinlandnavigationpaynoduty. Wheretheyarenaturallycheap,they
679 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
are consumed duty free: where they are naturally dear, they are loaded
withaheavyduty.
1907 [13] Such taxes, though they raise the price of subsistence, and con-
sequently the wages of labour, yet they afford a considerable revenue to
government which it might not be easy to find in any other way. There
may, therefore, be good reasons for continuing them. The bounty upon
the exportation of corn, so far as it tends in the actual state of tillage to
raise the price of that necessary article, produces all the like bad effects,
and instead of affording any revenue, frequently occasions a very great
expense to government. The high duties upon the importation of foreign
corn, which in years of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, and the
absolute prohibition of the importation either of live cattle or of salt pro-
visions, which takes place in the ordinary state of the law, and which, on
account of the scarcity, is at present suspended for a limited time with
regard to Ireland and the British plantations, have all the bad effects of

1908 [14] Taxesuponthenecessariesoflifearemuchhigherinmanyothercoun-
tries than in Great Britain. Duties upon flour and meal when ground at
the mill, and upon bread when baked at the oven, take place in many
countries. In Holland the money price of the bread consumed in towns is
supposed to be doubled by means of such taxes. In lieu of a part of them,
the people who live in the country pay every year so much a head accord-
ingtothesortofbreadtheyaresupposedtoconsume. Thosewhoconsume
wheaten bread pay three guilders fifteen stivers; about six shillings and
ninepence halfpenny. These, and some other taxes of the same kind, by
raising the price of labour, are said to have ruined the greater part of the
manufacturesofHolland22. Similartaxes,thoughnotquitesoheavy,take G.ed.p876
place in the Milanese, in the states of Genoa, in the duchy of Modena, in
the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, and in the ecclesiastical
state. AFrench23 authorofsomenotehasproposedtoreformthefinances

bread. It may indeed be doubted whether butchers’ meat is anywhere a

of the former method of imposing: the greater part of the other duties of

taxes which affect houses are certainly more conveniently paid by mod-
erate annual payments than by a heavy tax of equal value upon the first

1912 [18] It was the well-known proposal of Sir Matthew Decker that all com-
modities,eventhoseofwhichtheconsumptioniseitherimmediateorvery
speedy,shouldbetaxedinthismanner,thedealeradvancingnothing,but
the consumer paying a certain annual sum for the licence to consume
certain goods. The object of his scheme was to promote all the differ-
ent branches of foreign trade, particularly the carrying trade, by taking
away all duties upon importation and exportation, and thereby enabling
the merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of
goods and the freight of ships, no part of either being diverted towards
the advancing of taxes. The project, however, of taxing, in this manner,
goodsofimmediateorspeedyconsumptionseemsliabletothefourfollow-
ing very important objections. First, the tax would be more unequal, or
not so well proportioned to the expense and consumption of the different
contributors as in the way in which it is commonly imposed. The taxes
upon ale, wine, and spirituous liquors, which are advanced by the deal-
ers, are finally paid by the different consumers exactly in proportion to
their respective consumption. But if the tax were to be paid by purchas-
ing a licence to drink those liquors, the sober would, in proportion to his
consumption, betaxedmuch more heavilythanthedrunkenconsumer. A

paying for an annual, half-yearly, or quarterly licence to consume certain
goods,woulddiminishverymuchoneoftheprincipalconveniencesoftaxes G.ed.p878
upongoodsofspeedyconsumptionthepiecemealpayment. Inthepriceof
threepence halfpenny, which is at present paid for a pot of porter, the dif-
ferent taxes upon malt, hops, and beer, together with the extraordinary
profit which the brewer charges for having advanced them, may perhaps
amount to about three halfpence. If a workman can conveniently spare
those three halfpence, he buys a pot of porter. If he cannot, he contents
himself with a pint, and, as a penny saved is a penny got, he thus gains
a farthing by his temperance. He pays the tax piecemeal as he can afford
to pay it, and when he can afford to pay it, and every act of payment is
perfectly voluntary, and what he can avoid if he chooses to do so. Thirdly,
such taxes would operate less as sumptuary laws. When the licence was
once purchased, whether the purchaser drank much or drank little, his
tax would be the same. Fourthly, if a workman were to pay all at once,
by yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly payments, a tax equal to what he at
present pays, with little or no inconveniency, upon all the different pots
and pints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time, the sum
might frequently distress him very much. This mode of taxation, there-
fore, it seems evident, could never, without the most grievous oppression,
produce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode
without any oppression. In several countries, however, commodities of an
immediate or very speedy consumption are taxed in this manner. In Hol-
land people pay so much a head for a licence to drink tea. I have already
mentionedataxuponbread,which,sofarasitisconsumedinfarm-houses
andcountryvillages,isthereleviedinthesamemanner.
1913 [19] The duties of excise are imposed briefly upon goods of home produce
destined for home consumption. They are imposed only upon a few sorts
ofgoodsofthemostgeneraluse. Therecanneverbeanydoubteithercon-

1915 [21] Thegainsofalienmerchantswerelookeduponmoreunfavourablythan
those of English merchants. It was natural, therefore, that those of the

tion between the duties upon aliens and those upon English merchants,
which was begun from ignorance, has been continued from the spirit of
monopoly,orinordertogiveourownmerchantsanadvantagebothinthe
homeandintheforeignmarket.
1916 [22] With this distinction, the ancient duties of customs were imposed
equally upon all sorts of goods, necessaries as well as luxuries, goods ex-
ported as well as goods imported. Why should the dealers in one sort of
goods, it seems to have been thought, be more favoured than those in an-
other? or why should the merchant exporter be more favoured than the
merchantimporter?
1917 [23] The ancient customs were divided into three branches. The first, and
perhaps the most ancient of all those duties, was that upon wool and
leather. It seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation duty.
When the woollen manufacture came to be established in England, lest
the king should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the exporta-
tion of woollen cloths, a like duty was imposed upon them. The other two
branches were, first, a duty upon wine, which, being imposed at so much
a ton, was called a tonnage, and, secondly, a duty upon all other goods,
which, being imposed at so much a pound of their supposed value, was
called a poundage. In the forty-seventh year of Edward III a duty of six-
pence in the pound was imposed upon all goods exported and imported,
except wools, wool-fells, leather, and wines, which were subject to partic-
ular duties. In the fourteenth of Richard II this duty was raised to one
shilling in the pound, but three years afterwards it was again reduced to
sixpence. It was raised to eightpence in the second year of Henry IV, and
inthefourthyearofthesameprincetooneshilling. Fromthistimetothe
ninthyearofWilliamIIIthisdutycontinuedatoneshillinginthepound.
The duties of tonnage and poundage were generally granted to the king
by one and the same Act of Parliament, and were called the Subsidy of G.ed.p880
TonnageandPoundage. TheSubsidyofPoundagehavingcontinuedforso
longatimeatoneshininginthepound,oratfivepercent,asubsidycame,
inthelanguageofthecustoms,todenoteageneraldutyofthiskindoffive
per cent. This subsidy, which is now called the Old Subsidy, still contin-
ues to be levied according to the book of rates established in the twelfth
of Charles II. The method of ascertaining, by a book of rates, the value
of goods subject to this duty is said to be older than the time of James
I. The New Subsidy imposed by the ninth and tenth of William III was
an additional five per cent upon the greater part of goods. The One-third

1918 [24] That system has come gradually more and more into fashion. The Old

labour of the country, I have endeavoured to show in the fourth book of
this Inquiry. It seems not to have been more favourable to the revenue of
the sovereign, so far at least as that revenue depends upon the duties of
customs.

It has entirely prevented the importation of foreign woollens, and it has
very much diminished that of foreign silks and velvets. In both cases it
has entirely annihilated the revenue of customs which might have been
levieduponsuchimportation.
1921 [27] The high duties which have been imposed upon the importation of
many different sorts of foreign goods, in order to discourage their con-
sumption in Great Britain, have in many cases served only to encourage G.ed.p882
smuggling,andinallcaseshavereducedtherevenueofthecustomsbelow

duties which never could have been imposed had not the mercantile sys-

1922 [28] Thebountieswhicharesometimesgivenupontheexportationofhome
produce and manufactures, and the drawbacks which are paid upon the
re-exportation of the greater part of foreign goods, have given occasion to
manyfrauds, andtoaspeciesofsmugglingmoredestructiveofthepublic
revenue than any other. In order to obtain the bounty or drawback, the
goods, it is well known, are sometimes shipped and sent to sea, but soon
afterwards clandestinely relanded in some other part of the country. The
defalcationoftherevenueofcustomsoccasionedbythebountiesanddraw-
backs, of which a great part are obtained fraudulently, is very great. The

1926 [32] The foreign articles of the most general use and consumption in Great
Britain seem at present to consist chiefly in foreign wines and brandies;
in some of the productions of America and the West Indies- sugar, rum,
tobacco,cocoanuts,etc.;andinsomeofthoseoftheEastIndies-tea,coffee,
china-ware, spiceries of all kinds, several sorts of piece-goods, etc. These
different articles afford, perhaps, at present, the greater part of the rev-
enue which is drawn from the duties of customs. The taxes which at
present subsist upon foreign manufactures, if you except those upon the
fewcontainedintheforegoingenumeration,havethegreaterpartofthem G.ed.p884
been imposed for the purpose, not of revenue, but of monopoly, or to give
our own merchants an advantage in the home market. By removing all
prohibitions, and by subjecting all foreign manufactures to such moder-
ate taxes as it was found from experience afforded upon each article the
greatest revenue to the public, our own workmen might still have a con-

1927 [33] High taxes, sometimes by diminishing the consumption of the taxed
commodities, andsometimesbyencouragingsmuggling, frequentlyafford
686 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a smaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more
moderatetaxes.

remediedintwoways;eitherbydiminishingthetemptationtosmuggle,or
by increasing the difficulty of smuggling. The temptation to smuggle can
be diminished only by the lowering of the tax, and the difficulty of smug-
gling can be increased only by establishing that system of administration
whichismostproperforpreventingit.

likely,eithertheonewayortheother,toaffordthegreatestrevenuetothe
state, taxation being always employed as an instrument of revenue and
never of monopoly, it seems not improbable that a revenue at least equal
to the present net revenue of the customs might be drawn from duties
upon the importation of only a few sorts of goods of the most general use
andconsumption,andthatthedutiesofcustomsmightthusbebroughtto
the same degree of simplicity, certainty, and precision as those of excise.
What the revenue at present loses by drawbacks upon the re-exportation
of foreign goods which are afterwards relanded and consumed at home
wouldunderthissystembesavedaltogether. Iftothissaving,whichwould
alone be very considerable, were added the abolition of all bounties upon
theexportationofhomeproduceinallcasesinwhichthosebountieswere
not in reality drawbacks of some duties of excise which had before been
advanced, it cannot well be doubted but that the net revenue of customs
might, after an alteration of this kind, be fully equal to what it had ever
beenbefore.
1933 [39] If by such a change of system the public revenue suffered no loss, the
trade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very con-
siderable advantage. The trade in the commodities not taxed, by far the
greatest number, would be perfectly free, and might be carried on to and
from all parts of the world with every possible advantage. Among those
commoditieswouldbecomprehendedallthenecessariesoflifeandallthe
materials of manufacture. So far as the free importation of the necessar-
ies of life reduced their average money price in the home market it would
reduce the money price of labour, but without reducing in any respect its
real recompense. The value of money is in proportion to the quantity of G.ed.p886
thenecessariesoflifewhichitwillpurchase. Thatofthenecessariesoflife
is altogether independent of the quantity of money which can be had for
them. Thereductioninthemoneypriceoflabourwouldnecessarilybeat-
tendedwithaproportionableoneinthatofallhomemanufactures,which
would thereby gain some advantage in all foreign markets. The price of
some manufactures would be reduced in a still greater proportion by the
free importation of the raw materials. If raw silk could be imported from
China and Indostan duty free, the silk manufacturers in England could
greatly undersell those of both France and Italy. There would be no occa-
siontoprohibittheimportationofforeignsilksandvelvets. Thecheapness
of their goods would secure to our own workmen not only the possession
of the home, but a very great command of the foreign market. Even the
trade in the commodities taxed would be carried on with much more ad-
vantage than at present. If those commodities were delivered out of the
publicwarehouseforforeignexportation,beinginthiscaseexemptedfrom
all taxes, the trade in them would be perfectly free. The carrying trade
in all sorts of goods would under this system enjoy every possible advant-
age. If those commodities were delivered out for home consumption, the
688 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
importer not being obliged to advance the tax till he had an opportunity
of selling his goods, either to some dealer, or to some consumer, he could
always afford to sell them cheaper than if he had been obliged to advance
it at the moment of importation. Under the same taxes, the foreign trade
of consumption even in the taxed commodities might in this manner be
carriedonwithmuchmoreadvantagethanitcanbeatpresent.
1934 [40] It was the object of the famous excise scheme of Sir Robert Walpole to
establish, with regard to wine and tobacco, a system not very unlike that
which is here proposed. But though the bill which was then brought into
Parliament comprehended those two commodities, only it was generally
supposedtobemeantasanintroductiontoamoreextensiveschemeofthe
same kind, faction, combined with the interest of smuggling merchants,
raised so violent, though so unjust, a clamour against that bill, that the
ministerthoughtpropertodropit,andfromadreadofexcitingaclamour

1935 [41] The duties upon foreign luxuries imported for home consumption,
though they sometimes fall upon the poor, fall principally upon people of
middlingormorethanmiddlingfortune. Suchare,forexample,theduties
uponforeignwines,uponcoffee,chocolate,tea,sugar,etc.
1936 [42] The duties upon the cheaper luxuries of home produce destined for G.ed.p887
home consumption fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks in propor-
tiontotheirrespectiveexpense. Thepoorpaythedutiesuponmalt,hops,
beer, and ale, upon their own consumption: the rich, upon both their own
consumptionandthatoftheirservants.
1937 [43] Thewholeconsumptionoftheinferiorranksofpeople,orofthosebelow
the middling rank, it must be observed, is in every country much greater,
not only in quantity, but in value, than that of the middling and of those
abovethemiddlingrank. Thewholeexpenseoftheinferiorismuchgreater
than that of the superior ranks. In the first place, almost the whole cap-
ital of every country is annually distributed among the inferior ranks of
people as the wages of productive labour. Secondly, a great part of the
revenue arising from both the rent of land and the profits of stock is an-
nuallydistributedamongthesamerankinthewagesandmaintenanceof
menial servants, and other unproductive labourers. Thirdly, some part of
the profits of stock belongs to the same rank as a revenue arising from
the employment of their small capitals. The amount of the profits an-
nually made by small shopkeepers, tradesmen, and retailers of all kinds
is everywhere very considerable, and makes a very considerable portion
of the annual produce. Fourthly, and lastly, some part even of the rent
of land belongs to the same rank, a considerable part of those who are
somewhat below the middling rank, and a small part even to the lowest
rank, common labourers sometimes possessing in property an acre or two
of land. Though the expense of those inferior ranks of people, therefore,
taking them individually, is very small, yet the whole mass of it, taking
them collectively, amounts always to by much the largest portion of the
689 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
whole expense of the society; what remains of the annual produce of the
land and labour of the country for the consumption of the superior ranks
beingalwaysmuchless,notonlyinquantity,butinvalue. Thetaxesupon
expense, therefore, which fall chiefly upon that of the superior ranks of
people, upon the smaller portion of the annual produce, are likely to be
much less productive than either those which fall indifferently upon the
expense of all ranks, or even those which fall chiefly upon that of the in-
feriorranks;thaneitherthosewhichfallindifferentlyuponthewholean-
nualproduce,orthosewhichfallchieflyuponthelargerportionofit. The
excise upon the materials and manufacture of home-made fermented and
spirituous liquors is accordingly, of all the different taxes upon expense,
by far the most productive; and this branch of the excise falls very much,
perhaps principally, upon the expense of the common people. In the year
which ended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce of this branch of G.ed.p888
theexciseamountedto3,341,837l.9s.9d.
1938 [44] It must always be remembered, however, that it is the luxurious and
not the necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people that ought ever
to be taxed. The final payment of any tax upon their necessary expense
would fall altogether upon the superior ranks of people; upon the smaller
portion of the annual produce, and not upon the greater. Such a tax must

1939 [45] Fermentedliquorsbrewed,andspirituousliquorsdistilled,notforsale,
but for private use, are not in Great Britain liable to any duties of excise.
This exemption, of which the object is to save private families from the
odious visit and examination of the tax-gatherer, occasions the burden of
those duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich than upon the
poor. It is not, indeed, very common to distil for private use, though it is
donesometimes. Butinthecountrymanymiddlingandalmostallrichand
greatfamiliesbrewtheirownbeer. Theirstrongbeer,therefore,coststhem
eight shillings a barrel less than it costs the common brewer, who must
havehisprofituponthetaxaswellasuponalltheotherexpensewhichhe
advances. Such families, therefore, must drink their beer at least nine or
ten shillings a barrel cheaper than any liquor of the same quality can be
drunk by the common people, to whom it is everywhere more convenient
to buy their beer, by little and little, from the brewery or the alehouse.
Malt, in the same manner, that is made for the use of a private family
is not liable to the visit or examination of the tax-gatherer; but in this
690 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
case the family must compound at seven shillings and sixpence a head
for the tax. Seven shillings and sixpence are equal to the excise upon ten
bushels of malt- a quantity fully equal to what all the different members
of any sober family, men, women, and children, are at an average likely
to consume. But in rich and great families, where country hospitality is
much practised, the malt liquors consumed by the members of the family
makebutasmallpartoftheconsumptionofthehouse. Eitheronaccount
ofthiscomposition,however,orforotherreasons,itisnotnearsocommon

those upon strong beer and ale to eight shillings a barrel. In the porter

between twenty-six and thirty shillings upon the produce of a quarter of

upon the hogshead of cyder, and another of ten shillings upon the barrel
of mum. In 1774, the tax upon cyder produced only 3083l.6s.8d. It prob-
ably fell somewhat short of its usual amount, all the different taxes upon
cyder having, that year, produced less than ordinary. The tax upon mum,
though much heavier, is still less productive, on account of the smaller
consumption of that liquor. But to balance whatever may be the ordinary

probably much more than counterbalance that of the duties imposed by
whatiscalledtheannualmalttaxuponcyderandmum.
1943 [49] Malt is consumed not only in the brewery of beer and ale, but in the
manufacture of wines and spirits. If the malt tax were to be raised to
eighteen shillings upon the quarter, it might be necessary to make some
abatement in the different excises which are imposed upon those partic-
ular sorts of low wines and spirits of which malt makes any part of the G.ed.p891
materials. In what are called malt spirits it makes commonly but a third

According to this policy, the abatement of the taxes upon the distillery

1945 [51] TheobjectionsofDr.Davenanttothisalterationinthepresentsystem

in the neighbourhood. The present duties upon malt, beer, and ale do not
affect the profits of the dealers in those commodities, who all get back
the tax with an additional profit in the enhanced price of their goods. A
tax, indeed, may render the goods upon which it is imposed so dear as to
diminishtheconsumptionofthem. Buttheconsumptionofmaltisinmalt
liquors, and a tax of eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt could not
well render those liquors dearer than the different taxes, amounting to
twenty-four or twenty-five shillings, do at present. Those liquors, on the
contrary, would probably become cheaper, and the consumption of them
wouldbemorelikelytoincreasethantodiminish.

to advance a tax of twenty-four or twenty-five, sometimes thirty, shillings
upon every quarter of malt which he brews. It could not be more incon-
venient for the maltster to advance a lighter tax than it is at present for
the brewer to advance a heavier one. The maltster doth not always keep
in his granaries a stock of malt which it will require a longer time to dis-
pose of than the stock of beer and ale which the brewer frequently keeps
inhiscellars. Theformer,therefore,mayfrequentlygetthereturnsofhis

1948 [54] Nothing could reduce the rent and profit of barley land which did not
reduce the demand for barley. But a change of system which reduced the
duties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale from twenty-four
and twenty-five shillings to eighteen shillings would be more likely to in-
crease than diminish that demand. The rent and profit of barley land,
besides, must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile and
equally well-cultivated land. If they were less, some part of the barley
landwouldsoonbeturnedtosomeotherpurpose;andiftheyweregreater,
more land would soon be turned to the raising of barley. When the or-
dinary price of any particular produce of land is at what may be called a
monopoly price, a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and profit of
the land which grows it. A tax upon the produce of those precious vine- G.ed.p893
yards of which the wine falls so much short of the effectual demand that
its price is always above the natural proportion to that of the produce of
otherequallyfertileandequallywellcultivatedlandwouldnecessarilyre-
duce the rent and profit of those vineyards. The price of the wines being
already the highest that could be got for the quantity commonly sent to
market, it could not be raised higher without diminishing that quantity,
694 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
and the quantity could not be diminished without still greater loss, be-
causethelandscouldnotbeturnedtoanyotherequallyvaluableproduce.
Thewholeweightofthetax,therefore,wouldfallupontherentandprofit-
properly upon the rent of the vineyard. When it has been proposed to lay
any new tax upon sugar, our sugar planters have frequently complained
that thewhole weight of suchtaxes fell, notupon the consumer, but upon
theproducer,theyneverhavingbeenabletoraisethepriceoftheirsugar

was an improper subject of taxation demonstrated, perhaps, that it was a
properone,thegainsofmonopolists,whenevertheycanbecomeat,being
certainly of all subjects the most proper. But the ordinary price of barley
has never been a monopoly price, and the rent and profit of barley land
have never been above their natural proportion to those of other equally
fertile and equally well-cultivated land. The different taxes which have

have constantly either raised the price, or what comes to the same thing,
reduced the quality of those commodities to the consumer. The final pay-
mentofthosetaxeshasfallenconstantlyupontheconsumer,andnotupon

1949 [55] The only people likely to suffer by the change of system here proposed
arethosewhobrewfortheirownprivateuse. Buttheexemptionwhichthis
superior rank of people at present enjoy from very heavy taxes which are
paidbythepoorlabourerandartificerissurelymostunjustandunequal,
and ought to be taken away, even though this change was never to take
place. It has probably been the interest of this superior order of people,
however, which has hitherto prevented a change of system that could not
wellfailbothtoincreasetherevenueandtorelievethepeople.
1950 [56] Besides such duties as those of customs and excise above mentioned,
there are several others which affect the price of goods more unequally
andmoreindirectly. OfthiskindarethedutieswhichinFrencharecalled G.ed.p894

pike tolls, or the tolls upon our canals and navigable rivers, for the main-
tenance of the road or of the navigation. Those duties, when applied to
suchpurposes,aremostproperlyimposedaccordingtothebulkorweight

to local and provincial purposes, the administration of them was in most
cases entrusted to the particular town, parish, or lordship in which they
werelevied, such communities beinginsome wayorother supposed tobe
accountable for the application. The sovereign, who is altogether unac-
countable, has in many countries assumed to himself the administration
695 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
of those duties, and though he has in most cases enhanced very much the
duty, he has in many entirely neglected the application. If the turnpike
tolls of Great Britain should ever become one of the resources of govern-
ment, we may learn, by the example of many other nations, what would
probably be the consequence. Such tolls are no doubt finally paid by the
consumer;buttheconsumerisnottaxedinproportiontohisexpensewhen

bulk or weight, but according to the supposed value of the goods, they be-

1951 [57] Insomesmallstatesdutiessimilartothosepassagedutiesareimposed
upon goods carried across the territory, either by land or by water, from

1952 [58] Such taxes upon luxuries as the greater part of the duties of customs
and excise, though they all fall indifferently upon every different species
of revenue, and are paid finally, or without any retribution, by whoever
consumes the commodities upon which they are imposed, yet they do not
alwaysfallequallyorproportionablyupontherevenueofeveryindividual. G.ed.p895
As every man’s humour regulates the degree of his consumption, every
man contributes rather according to his humour than in proportion to his
revenue; the profuse contribute more, the parsimonious less, than their
proper proportion. During the minority of a man of great fortune he con-
tributes commonly very little, by his consumption, towards the support of
that state from whose protection he derives a great revenue. Those who
liveinanothercountrycontributenothing,bytheirconsumption,towards
the support of the government of that country in which is situated the
source of their revenue. If in this latter country there should be no land-
tax,noranyconsiderabledutyuponthetransferenceeitherofmovableor

riveagreatrevenuefromtheprotectionofagovernmenttothesupportof

we cannot, therefore, wonder that the proposal of a tax upon absentees
696 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
shouldbesoverypopularinthatcountry. Itmight,perhaps,bealittledif-
ficulttoascertaineitherwhatsortorwhatdegreeofabsencewouldsubject

casionsthatinequality-thecircumstancethateveryman’scontributionis
altogether voluntary, it being altogether in his power either to consume
or not to consume the commodity taxed. Where such taxes, therefore, are
properly assessed, and upon proper commodities, they are paid with less
grumbling than any other. When they are advanced by the merchant or
manufacturer, the consumer, who finally pays them, soon comes to con-
found them with the price of the commodities, and almost forgets that he
paysanytax.

bepaid; concerningeitherthequantityorthetimeofpayment. Whatever
uncertainty there may sometimes be, either in the duties of customs in
Great Britain, or in other duties of the same kind in other countries, it
cannot arise from the nature of those duties, but from the inaccurate or
unskilfulmannerinwhichthelawthatimposesthemisexpressed.
1954 [60] Taxesuponluxuriesgenerallyare,andalwaysmaybe,paidpiecemeal,
or in proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the goods
uponwhichtheyareimposed. Inthetimeandmodeofpaymenttheyare,
or may be, of all taxes the most convenient. Upon the whole, such taxes,
are, perhaps, as agreeable to the three first of the four general maxims
concerningtaxationasanyother. Theyoffendineveryrespectagainstthe
fourth.
1955 [61] Such taxes, in proportion to what they bring into the public treasury
ofthestate, alwaystakeoutorkeepoutofthepocketsofthepeoplemore
thanalmostanyothertaxes. Theyseemtodothisinallthefourdifferent
waysinwhichitispossibletodoit.
1956 [62] First, the levying of such taxes, even when imposed in the most judi-
ciousmanner,requiresagreatnumberofcustom-houseandexciseofficers,
whosesalariesandperquisitesarearealtaxuponthepeople,whichbrings
nothing into the treasury of the state. This expense, however, it must be
acknowledged,ismoremoderateinGreatBritainthaninmostothercoun-
tries. In the year which ended on the 5th of July 1775, the gross produce
ofthedifferentduties,underthemanagementofthecommissionersofex-
cise in England, amounted to 5,507,308l.18s.81d., which was levied at an
4
expense of little more than five and a half per cent. From this gross pro-
duce, however, there must be deducted what was paid away in bounties
anddrawbacksupontheexportationofexcisablegoods,whichwillreduce
697 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the net produce below five millions25. The levying of the salt duty, an
excise duty, but under a different management, is much more expensive.
Thenetrevenueofthecustomsdoesnotamounttotwomillionsandahalf,
which is levied at an expense of more than ten per cent in the salaries of
officers, and other incidents. But the perquisites of custom-house officers
areeverywheremuchgreaterthantheirsalaries;atsomeportsmorethan G.ed.p897
double or triple those salaries. If the salaries of officers, and other incid-
ents, therefore, amount to more than ten per cent upon the net revenue
ofthecustoms,thewholeexpenseoflevyingthatrevenuemayamount,in
salaries and perquisites together, to more than twenty or thirty per cent.
The officers of excise receive few or no perquisites, and the administra-
tion of that branch of the revenue, being of more recent establishment, is
in general less corrupted than that of the customs, into which length of
timehasintroducedandauthorizedmanyabuses. Bycharginguponmalt
the whole revenue which is at present levied by the different duties upon
maltandmaltliquors,asaving,itissupposed,ofmorethanfiftythousand
pounds might be made in the annual expense of the excise. By confining
thedutiesofcustomstoafewsortsofgoods,andbylevyingthosedutiesac-
cordingtotheexciselaws,amuchgreatersavingmightprobablybemade
intheannualexpenseofthecustoms.
1957 [63] Secondly, such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or discour-
agement to certain branches of industry. As they always raise the price
of the commodity taxed, they so far discourage its consumption, and con-
sequentlyitsproduction. Ifitisacommodityofhomegrowthormanufac-
ture, less labour comes to be employed in raising and producing it. If it is
a foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this manner the price,
the commodities of the same kind which are made at home may thereby,
indeed, gain some advantage in the home market, and a greater quantity
of domestic industry may thereby be turned toward preparing them. But
though this rise of price in a foreign commodity may encourage domestic
industryinoneparticularbranch,itnecessarilydiscouragesthatindustry
inalmosteveryother. ThedearertheBirminghammanufacturerbuyshis
foreign wine, the cheaper he necessarily sells that part of his hardware
with which, or, what comes to the same thing, with the price of which he
buysit. Thatpartofhishardware,therefore,becomesoflessvaluetohim,
andhehaslessencouragementtoworkatit. Thedearertheconsumersin
one country pay for the surplus produce of another, the cheaper they ne-
cessarily sell that part of their own surplus produce with which, or, what
comestothe same thing, withthepriceof which theybuyit. Thatpartof
their own surplus produce becomes of less value to them, and they have
less encouragement to increase its quantity. All taxes upon consumable
commodities, therefore, tend to reduce the quantity of productive labour
below what it otherwise would be, either in preparing the commodities

amountedto4,975,652l.19s.6d.

they are purchased, if they are foreign commodities. Such taxes, too, al-
ways alter, more or less, the natural direction of national industry, and
turnitintoachannelalwaysdifferentfrom,andgenerallylessadvantage- G.ed.p898

1958 [64] Thirdly, the hope of evading such taxes by smuggling gives frequent
occasion to forfeitures and other penalties which entirely ruin the smug-
gler;apersonwho,thoughnodoubthighlyblamableforviolatingthelaws
ofhiscountry,isfrequentlyincapableofviolatingthoseofnaturaljustice,
and would have been, in every respect, an excellent citizen had not the
lawsofhiscountrymadethatacrimewhichnaturenevermeanttobeso.
In those corrupted governments where there is at least a general suspi-
cion of much unnecessary expense, and great misapplication of the public
revenue,thelawswhichguarditarelittlerespected. Notmanypeopleare
scrupulousaboutsmugglingwhen,withoutperjury,theycanfindanyeasy
and safe opportunity of doing so. To pretend to have any scruple about

wouldinmostcountriesberegardedasoneofthosepedanticpiecesofhy-
pocrisywhich,insteadofgainingcreditwithanybody,serveonlytoexpose
thepersonwhoaffectstopractisethemtothesuspicionofbeingagreater
knave than most of his neighbours. By this indulgence of the public, the
smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade which he is thus taught
toconsiderasinsomemeasureinnocent,andwhentheseverityoftherev-
enue laws is ready to fall upon him, he is frequently disposed to defend
withviolencewhathehasbeenaccustomedtoregardashisjustproperty.
From being at first, perhaps, rather imprudent than criminal, he at last
toooftenbecomesoneofthehardiestandmostdeterminedviolatorsofthe
laws of society. By the ruin of the smuggler, his capital, which had before
beenemployedinmaintainingproductivelabour,isabsorbedeitherinthe
revenue of the state or in that of the revenue officer, and is employed in
maintaining unproductive, to the diminution of the general capital of the
society and of the useful industry which it might otherwise have main-
tained.
1959 [65] Fourthly, such taxes, by subjecting at least the dealers in the taxed
commodities to the frequent visits and odious examination of the tax-
gatherers,exposethemsometimes,nodoubt,tosomedegreeofoppression,
and always to much trouble and vexation; and though vexation, as has
alreadybeensaid,isnot,strictlyspeaking,expense,itiscertainlyequival-
enttotheexpenseatwhicheverymanwouldbewillingtoredeemhimself

cise. Thedealershavenorespitefromthecontinualvisitsandexamination
oftheexciseofficers. Thedutiesofexciseare,uponthisaccount,moreun-
popular than those of the customs; and so are the officers who levy them.
Those officers, it is pretended, though in general, perhaps, they do their
duty fully as well as those of the customs, yet as that duty obliges them
to be frequently very troublesome to some of their neighbours, commonly
contractacertainhardnessofcharacterwhichtheothersfrequentlyhave
not. Thisobservation,however,mayveryprobablybethemeresuggestion
of fraudulent dealers whose smuggling is either prevented or detected by
theirdiligence.
1960 [66] The inconveniencies, however, which are, perhaps, in some degree in-
separablefromtaxesuponconsumablecommodities,fallaslightuponthe
people of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which the
governmentisnearlyasexpensive. Ourstateisnotperfect,andmightbe
mended,butitisasgoodorbetterthanthatofmostofourneighbours.
1961 [67] In consequence of the notion that duties upon consumable goods were
taxes upon the profits of merchants, those duties have, in some coun-
tries, been repeated upon every successive sale of the goods. If the profits
of the merchant importer or merchant manufacturer were taxed, equal-
ity seemed to require that those of all the middle buyers who intervened
between either of them and the consumer should likewise be taxed. The
famous alcavala of Spain seems to have been established upon this prin-
ciple. It was at first a tax of ten per cent, afterwards of fourteen per cent,
andisatpresentofonlysixpercentuponthesaleofeverysortofproperty
whethermovableorimmovable,anditisrepeatedeverytimetheproperty
is sold26. The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue officers
sufficienttoguardthetransportationofgoods,notonlyfromoneprovince
to another, but from one shop to another. It subjects not only the dealers
in some sorts of goods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manu-
facturer, every merchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visits and ex-
amination of the tax-gatherers. Through the greater part of a country in
whichataxofthiskindisestablishednothingcanbeproducedfordistant
sale. Theproduceofeverypartofthecountrymustbeproportionedtothe
consumption of the neighborhood. It is to the alcavala, accordingly, that
Ustaritz imputes the ruin of the manufactures of Spain. He might have G.ed.p900
imputed to it likewise the declension of agriculture, it being imposed not
onlyuponmanufactures,butupontherudeproduceoftheland.
1962 [68] In the kingdom of Naples there is a similar tax of three per cent upon
the value of all contracts, and consequently upon that of all contracts of
sale. ItisbothlighterthantheSpanishtax,andthegreaterpartoftowns
and parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it. They levy this

interruption to the interior commerce of the place. The Neapolitan tax,
therefore,isnotnearsoruinousastheSpanishone.
1963 [69] Theuniformsystemoftaxationwhich,withafewexceptionsofnogreat
consequence, takes place in all the different parts of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain, leaves the interior commerce of the country, the inland
and coasting trade, almost entirely free. The inland trade is almost per-
fectly free, and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end of
thekingdomtotheotherwithoutrequiringanypermitorlet-pass,without
being subject to question, visit, or examination from the revenue officers.
There are a few exceptions, but they are such as can give no interruption
toanyimportantbranchoftheinlandcommerceofthecountry. Goodscar-
ried coastwise, indeed, require certificates or coast-cockets. If you except
coals, however, the rest are almost all duty-free. This freedom of interior
commerce, the effect of the uniformity of the system of taxation, is per-
haps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of Great Britain, every
greatcountrybeingnecessarilythebestandmostextensivemarketforthe
greater part of the productions of its own industry. If the same freedom,
in consequence of the same uniformity, could be extended to Ireland and
theplantations,boththegrandeurofthestateandtheprosperityofevery

1964 [70] In France, the different revenue laws which take place in the differ-
entprovincesrequireamultitudeofrevenueofficerstosurroundnotonly
thefrontiersofthekingdom,butthoseofalmosteachparticularprovince,
in order either to prevent the importation of certain goods, or to subject
it to the payment of certain duties, to the no small interruption of the
interior commerce of the country. Some provinces are allowed to com-
pound for the gabelle or salt-tax. Others are exempted from it altogether. G.ed.p901
Someprovincesareexemptedfromtheexclusivesaleoftobacco,whichthe

which correspond to the excise in England, are very different in different
provinces. Some provinces are exempted from them, and pay a composi-
tionorequivalent. Inthoseinwhichtheytakeplaceandareinfarmthere
are many local duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or
district. The traites, which correspond to our customs, divide the king-

those provinces which are said to be treated as foreign, or which, because

The provinces most famous for their wines, it will be found, I believe, are

vary from year to year according to the occasional variations in the pro-
duce of the tax, or they may be let in farm for a rent certain, the farmer
being allowed to appoint his own officers, who, though obliged to levy the
taxinthemannerdirectedbythelaw,areunderhisimmediateinspection,
andareimmediatelyaccountabletohim. Thebestandmostfrugalwayof
levying a tax can never be by farm. Over and above what is necessary for
paying the stipulated rent, the salaries of the officers, and the whole ex-
pense of administration, the farmer must always draw from the produce
of the tax a certain profit proportioned at least to the advance which he
makes, to the risk which he runs, to the trouble which he is at, and to
theknowledgeandskillwhichitrequirestomanagesoverycomplicateda
concern. Government, by establishing an administration under their own
immediate inspection of the same kind with that which the farmer estab-
702 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
lishes, might at least save this profit, which is almost always exorbitant.
To farm any considerable branch of the public revenue requires either a
great capital or a great credit; circumstances which would alone restrain
thecompetitionforsuchanundertakingtoaverysmallnumberofpeople.
Ofthefewwhohavethiscapitalorcredit,astillsmallernumberhavethe

the public revenues are in farm, the farmers are generally the most opu-
lent people. Their wealth would alone excite the public indignation, and
the vanity which almost always accompanies such upstart fortunes, the
foolishostentationwithwhichtheycommonlydisplaythatwealth,excites
thatindignationstillmore.
1968 [74] Thefarmersofthepublicrevenueneverfindthelawstooseverewhich G.ed.p903
punish any attempt to evade the payment of a tax. They have no bowels
forthecontributors,whoarenottheirsubjects,andwhoseuniversalbank-
ruptcy, if it should happen the day after their farm is expired, would not
much affect their interest. In the greatest exigencies of the state, when
theanxietyofthesovereignfortheexactpaymentofhisrevenueisneces-
sarily the greatest, they seldom fail to complain that without laws more
rigorous than those which actually take place, it will be impossible for
themtopayeventheusualrent. Inthosemomentsofpublicdistresstheir
demandscannotbedisputed. Therevenuelaws,therefore,becomegradu-
ally more and more severe. The most sanguinary are always to be found
in countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm; the
mildest, in countries where it is levied under the immediate inspection of
the sovereign. Even a bad sovereign feels more compassion for his people
thancaneverbeexpectedfromthefarmersofhisrevenue. Heknowsthat
the permanent grandeur of his family depends upon the prosperity of his
people, and he will never knowingly ruin that prosperity for the sake of
anymomentaryinterestofhisown. Itisotherwisewiththefarmersofhis

1969 [75] A tax is sometimes not only farmed for a certain rent, but the farmer
has, besides, the monopoly of the commodity taxed. In France, the duties
upontobaccoandsaltareleviedinthismanner. Insuchcasesthefarmer,
instead of one, levies two exorbitant profits upon the people; the profit of
the farmer, and the still more exorbitant one of the monopolist. Tobacco
being a luxury, every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he chooses.
Butsaltbeinganecessary,everymanisobligedtobuyofthefarmeracer-
tain quantity of it; because, if he did not buy this quantity of the farmer,
he would, it is presumed, buy it of some smuggler. The taxes upon both
commoditiesareexorbitant. Thetemptationtosmuggleconsequentlyisto

manypeopleirresistible,whileatthesametimetherigourofthelaw,and
thevigilanceofthefarmer’sofficers,rendertheyieldingtothattemptation
almost certainly ruinous. The smuggling of salt and tobacco sends every
year several hundred people to the galleys, besides a very considerable
number whom it sends to the gibbet. Those taxes levied in this manner
yield a very considerable revenue to government. In 1767, the farm of to-
baccowasletfortwenty-twomillionsfivehundredandforty-onethousand

Thosewhoconsiderthebloodofthepeopleasnothingincomparisonwith
the revenue of the prince, may perhaps approve of this method of levying
taxes. Similar taxes and monopolies of salt and tobacco have been estab-
lishedinmanyothercountries;particularlyintheAustrianandPrussian
dominions,andinthegreaterpartofthestatesofItaly.
1970 [76] InFrance,thegreaterpartoftheactualrevenueofthecrownisderived

1971 [77] The finances of France seem, in their present state, to admit of three
very obvious reformations. First, by abolishing the taille and the capita-
tion, and by increasing the number of vingtiemes, so as to produce an ad-
ditional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes, the revenue of
thecrownmightbepreserved;theexpenseofcollectionmightbemuchdi-

The vingtieme, I have already observed, is a tax very nearly of the same
kindwithwhatiscalledtheland-taxofEngland. Theburdenofthetaille,
it is acknowledged, falls finally upon the proprietors of land; and as the
greater part of the capitation is assessed upon those who are subject to
the taille at so much a pound of that other tax, the final payment of the
greaterpartofitmustlikewisefalluponthesameorderofpeople. Though
the number of the vingtiemes, therefore, was increased so as to produce
an additional revenue equal to the amount of both those taxes, the super-
ior ranks of people might not be more burdened than they are at present.

1972 [78] The French system of taxation seems, in every respect, inferior to the
British. In Great Britain ten millions sterling are annually levied upon
less than eight millions of people without its being possible to say that
any particular order is oppressed. From the collections of the Abbe Ex-
pilly,andtheobservationsoftheauthoroftheEssayuponlegislationand
commerceofcorn,itappearsprobablethatFrance,includingtheprovinces
of Lorraine and Bar, contains about twenty-three or twenty-four millions

it might be expected that in France a revenue of thirty millions might be

much more oppressed by taxes than the people of Great Britain. France,
however,iscertainlythegreatempireinEuropewhich,afterthatofGreat
Britain,enjoysthemildestandmostindulgentgovernment.
1973 [79] InHollandtheheavytaxesuponthenecessariesoflifehaveruined,itis

even their fisheries and their trade in shipbuilding. The taxes upon the

on manufactures are some duties upon the importation of raw materials, G.ed.p906
particularlyuponthatofrawsilk. Therevenueofthestates-generalandof
the different cities, however, is said to amount to more than five millions
two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; and as the inhabitants
of the United Provinces cannot well be supposed to amount to more than
705 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
a third part of those of Great Britain, they must, in proportion to their
number,bemuchmoreheavilytaxed.
1974 [80] After all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted, if the
exigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes, they must be

OF PUBLIC DEBTS
1975 [1] INthatrudestateofsocietywhichprecedestheextensionofcommerceand
the improvement of manufactures, when those expensive luxuries which
commerceandmanufacturescanaloneintroducearealtogetherunknown,
the person who possesses a large revenue, I have endeavoured to show
in the third book of this Inquiry, can spend or enjoy that revenue in no
otherwaythanbymaintainingnearlyasmanypeopleasitcanmaintain.
A large revenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a
large quantity of the necessaries of life. In that rude state of things it is
commonlypaidinalargequantityofthosenecessaries,inthematerialsof
plain food and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw hides.
Whenneithercommercenormanufacturesfurnishanythingforwhichthe
ownercanexchangethegreaterpartofthosematerialswhichareoverand
above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus but feed
and clothe nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A hospitality
in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there is no osten-
tation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal expenses of the
richandthegreat. Butthese, Ihavelikewiseendeavouredtoshowinthe
same book, are expenses by which people are not very apt to ruin them-
selves. Thereisnot,perhaps,anyselfishpleasuresofrivolousofwhichthe
pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible men. A passion for cock-
fighting has ruined many. But the instances, I believe, are not very nu-
merousofpeoplewhohavebeenruinedbyahospitalityorliberalityofthis
kind,thoughthehospitalityofluxuryandtheliberalityofostentationhave
ruinedmany. Amongourfeudalancestors,thelongtimeduringwhiches-
tates used to continue in the same family sufficiently demonstrates the
generaldispositionofpeopletolivewithintheirincome. Thoughtherustic
hospitalityconstantlyexercisedbythegreatland-holdersmaynot,tousin
thepresenttimes,seemconsistentwiththatorderwhichweareapttocon-
sider as inseparably connected with good economy, yet we must certainly
allow them to have been at least so far frugal as not commonly to have
spent their whole income. A part of their wool and raw hides they had
generally an opportunity of selling for money. Some part of this money,
perhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury
with which the circumstances of the times could furnish them; but some TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
part of it they seem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well, in-
deed,doanythingelsebuthoardwhatevermoneytheysaved. Totradewas
disgraceful to a gentleman, and to lend money at interest, which at that G.ed.p908

1976 [2] Thesamedispositiontosaveandtohoardprevailedinthesovereignas
well as in the subjects. Among nations to whom commerce and manufac-
tures are little known, the sovereign, it has already been observed in the
fourth book, is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsi-
mony requisite for accumulation. In that situation the expense even of a
sovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy
fineryofacourt. Theignoranceofthetimesaffordsbutfewofthetrinkets
in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then necessary, so
thattheexpenseevenofasovereign,likethatofanyothergreatlord,can
be employed in scarce anything but bounty to his tenants and hospitality
to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality very seldom lead to extra-
vagance; though vanity almost always does. All the ancient sovereigns of
Europe accordingly, it has already been observed, had treasures. Every
Tartarchiefinthepresenttimesissaidtohaveone.
1977 [3] Inacommercialcountryaboundingwitheverysortofexpensiveluxury,
the sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in
his dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchas-
ing those luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply him
abundantlywithallthecostlytrinketswhichcomposethesplendidbutin-

that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to
pleasures of this kind? If he does not, what he is very likely to do, spend
upon those pleasures so great a part of his revenue as to debilitate very
much the defensive power of the state, it cannot well be expected that he
shouldnotspenduponthemallthatpartofitwhichisoverandabovewhat
isnecessaryforsupportingthatdefensivepower. Hisordinaryexpensebe-
708 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
comesequaltohisordinaryrevenue,anditiswellifitdoesnotfrequently
exceed it. The amassing of treasure can no longer be expected, and when
extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expenses, he must neces-
sarilycalluponhissubjectsforanextraordinaryaid. Thepresentandthe
late king of Prussia are the only great princes of Europe who, since the
death of Henry IV of France in 1610, are supposed to have amassed any
considerable treasure. The parsimony which leads to accumulation has
become almost as rare in republican as in monarchical governments. The
Italianrepublics,theUnitedProvincesoftheNetherlands,areallindebt.
The canton of Berne is the single republic in Europe which has amassed
any considerable treasure. The other Swiss republics have not. The taste

licornaments,frequentlyprevailsasmuchintheapparentlysobersenate-

1978 [4] The want of parsimony in time of peace imposes the necessity of con-
tracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the
treasurybutwhatisnecessaryforcarryingontheordinaryexpenseofthe
peace establishment. In war an establishment of three of four times that
expense becomes necessary for the defence of the state, and consequently
a revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue. Supposing
that the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever has, the immediate
means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of
his expense, yet still the produce of the taxes, from which this increase
of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into the treasury till
perhapstenortwelvemonthsaftertheyareimposed. Butthemomentin
whichwarbegins,orratherthemomentinwhichitappearslikelytobegin,
the army must be augmented, the fleet must be fitted out, the garrisoned

sions. Animmediateandgreatexpensemust beincurredinthatmoment

butinborrowing.
1979 [5] The same commercial state of society which, by the operation of moral G.ed.p910
causes, brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrow-
ing, produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend.
If it commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing, it likewise
bringsalongwithitthefacilityofdoingso.
1980 [6] A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers necessarily
aboundswithasetofpeoplethroughwhosehandsnotonlytheirowncap-
itals, but the capitals of all those who either lend them money, or trust
themwithgoods,passasfrequently,ormorefrequently,thantherevenue
of a private man, who, without trade or business, lives upon his income,
passes through his hands. The revenue of such a man can regularly pass
through his hands only once in a year. But the whole amount of the cap-
709 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ital and credit of a merchant, who deals in a trade of which the returns
areveryquick,maysometimespassthroughhishandstwo,three,orfour
times a year. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers,
therefore,necessarilyaboundswithasetofpeoplewhohaveitatalltimes
intheirpowertoadvance,iftheychoosetodoso,averylargesumofmoney
to government. Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to
lend.
1981 [7] Commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state
which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the
people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property,
in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the
authorityofthestateisnotsupposedtoberegularlyemployedinenforcing
the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and
manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state in which there is
not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government. The same
confidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers, upon or-
dinary occasions, to trust their property to the protection of a particular
government, disposes them, upon extraordinary occasions, to trust that
government with the use of their property. By lending money to govern-
ment, they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry on
their trade and manufactures. On the contrary, they commonly augment
it. The necessities of the state render government upon most occasions
willing to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender. The
securitywhichitgrantstotheoriginalcreditorismadetransferabletoany

ment, from a fear that if it was known that they had a hoard, and where
that hoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In such a
state of things few people would be able, and nobody would be willing, to
lend their money to government on extraordinary exigencies. The sover-
eign feels that he must provide for such exigencies by saving because he
foresees the absolute impossibility of borrowing. This foresight increases

prettyuniform. Nations,likeprivatemen,havegenerallybeguntoborrow

any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this resource
has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mort-
gagesofparticularfunds.
1985 [11] What is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain is contracted in the
former of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears, or is
supposedtobear,nointerest,andwhichresemblesthedebtsthataprivate

arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those of seamen’s wages, etc., usu-

a part of such debts and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt

of England, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current
value, or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to cir-
culate exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the interest
which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value and facilitates G.ed.p912
theircirculation,andtherebyfrequentlyenablesgovernmenttocontracta
very large debt of this kind. In France, where there is no bank, the state
bills (billets d’etat)1 have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy per cent
discount. During the great recoinage in King William’s time, when the
Bank of England thought proper to put a stop to its usual transactions,
exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from twenty-five to sixty
percentdiscount;owingpartly,nodoubt,tothesupposedinstabilityofthe

1986 [12] When this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order
to raise money, to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the pub-
lic revenue for the payment of the debt, government has upon different
occasionsdonethisintwodifferentways. Sometimesithasmadethisas-

his revenue, the state is in the constant practice of borrowing of its own

1988 [14] In the reign of King William, and during a great part of that of Queen
Anne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice G.ed.p913
of perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but
for a short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only), and a
greatpartofthegrantsofeveryyearconsistedinloansuponanticipations
of the produce of those taxes. The produce being frequently insufficient
forpayingwithinthelimitedtermtheprincipalandinterestofthemoney

prolongtheterm.
1989 [15] In1697,bythe8thofWilliamIII,c.20,thedeficienciesofseveraltaxes
were charged upon what was then called the first general mortgage or
fund, consisting of a prolongation to the first of August 1706 of several
different taxes which would have expired within a shorter term, and of
which the produce was accumulated into one general fund. The deficien-
cieschargeduponthisprolongedtermamountedto5,160,459l.14s.91d.

1990 [16] In1701,thoseduties,withsomeothers,werestillfurtherprolongedfor

2,055,999l.7s.111d.
2
1991 [17] In 1707, those duties were still further prolonged, as a fund for new
loans, to the first of August 1712, and were called the third general mort-

1992 [18] In 1708, those duties were all (except the Old Subsidy of Tonnage and

1993 [19] In 1709, those cities were all (except the Old Subsidy of Tonnage and
712 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
Poundage, which was now left out of this fund altogether) still further
continued for the same purpose to the first of August 1716, and were
called the fifth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was
922,029l.6s.0d.

and were called the sixth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed

1995 [21] In 1711, the same duties (which at this time were thus subject to four
different anticipations) together with several others were continued for G.ed.p914
ever,andmadeafundforpayingtheinterestofthecapitaloftheSouthSea
Company, which had that year advanced to government, for paying debts
and making good deficiencies, the sum of 9,177,967l.15s.4d.; the greatest

1996 [22] Before this period, the principal, so far as I have been able to observe,
the only taxes which in order to pay the interest of a debt had been im-
posedforperpetuity,werethoseforpayingtheinterestofthemoneywhich
had been advanced to government by the Bank and the East India Com-
pany,andofwhatitwasexpectedwouldbeadvanced,butwhichwasnever

whichbythisactwerelikewiserenderedperpetual,wereaccumulatedinto

eralFund,forthepaymentofcertainannuities,amountinginthewholeto
724,849l.6s.101d.
2
1999 [25] In consequence of those different acts, the greater part of the taxes
which before had been anticipated only for a short term of years were
rendered perpetual as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the interest
only, of the money which had been borrowed upon them by different suc-
cessiveanticipations.

yearswouldhaveliberatedthepublicrevenuewithoutanyotherattention

713 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
greaterpartofEuropeangovernmentshavebeenincapableofthoseatten- G.ed.p915
tions. They have frequently overloaded the fund even upon the first anti-
cipation, and when this happened not to be the case, they have generally
taken care to overload it by anticipating a second and a third time before
theexpirationofthefirstanticipation. Thefundbecominginthismanner
altogetherinsufficientforpayingbothprincipalandinterestofthemoney
borrowed upon it, it became necessary to charge it with the interest only,
or a perpetual annuity equal to the interest, and such unprovident anti-
cipations necessarily gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual
funding. Butthoughthispracticenecessarilyputsofftheliberationofthe
public revenue from a fixed period to one so indefinite that it is not very

2001 [27] DuringthereignofQueenAnne,themarketrateofinteresthadfallen
from six to five per cent, and in the twelfth year of her reign five per
cent was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully be taken
for money borrowed upon private security. Soon after the greater part of
the temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual, and
distributed into the Aggregate, South Sea, and General Funds, the cred-
itors of the public, like those of private persons, were induced to accept of
five per cent for the interest of their money, which occasioned a saving of
one per cent upon the capital of the greater part of the debts which had
been thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-sixth of the greater part of the
annuities which were paid out of the three great funds above mentioned.
Thissavingleftaconsiderablesurplusintheproduceofthedifferenttaxes
whichhadbeenaccumulatedintothosefundsoverandabovewhatwasne-
cessaryforpayingtheannuitieswhichwerenowchargeduponthem,and
laid the foundation of what has since been called the Sinking Fund. In
1717, it amounted to 323,434l.7s.71d. In 1727, the interest of the greater
2
part of the public debts was still further reduced to four per cent; and in
1753 and 1757, to three and a half and three per cent; which reductions
stillfurtheraugmentedthesinkingfund.
2002 [28] A sinking fund, though instituted for the payment of old, facilitates G.ed.p916
very much the contracting of new debts. It is a subsidiary fund always at

2003 [29] Besides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by per-

2004 [30] During the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, large sums were
frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were some-
times longer and sometimes shorter. In 1693, an act was passed for bor-
rowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent, or of 140,000l. a
yearforsixteenyears. In1691, anactwaspassedforborrowingamillion

lowingyearthedeficiencywasmadegoodbyborrowinguponannuitiesfor

1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to ex-
changethemforothersofninety-sixyearsuponpayingintotheExchequer
sixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the difference between four-
teen per cent for life, and fourteen per cent for ninety-six years, was sold
forsixty-threepounds,orforfourandahalfyears’purchase. Suchwasthe
supposed instability of government that even these terms procured few
purchasers. In the reign of Queen Anne money was upon different occa-
sionsborrowedbothuponannuitiesforlives,anduponannuitiesforterms
of thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety-eight, and of ninety-nine years. In
1719,theproprietorsoftheannuitiesforthirty-twoyearswereinducedto G.ed.p917
accept in lieu of them South Sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half
years’ purchase of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of
stock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them. In
1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long
andshortweresubscribedintothesamefund. Thelongannuitiesatthat
time amounted to 666,821l.8s.31d. a year. On the 5th of January 1775,
2
theremainderofthem,orwhatwasnotsubscribedatthattime,amounted
onlyto136,453l.12s.8d.
2005 [31] During the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1755, little money
was borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for
lives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth
nearly as much money as a perpetuity, and should, therefore, one might
think, be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order
to make family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into
the public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value
was continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable
proportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity
for a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be very
nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the
same number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who mean
generally to sell their subscriptions as soon as possible, prefer greatly a
perpetual annuity redeemable by Parliament to an irredeemable annuity
for a long term of years of only equal amount. The value of the former

therefore,amoreconvenienttransferablestockthanthelatter.

yearsorforlives,wereseldomgrantedbutaspremiumstothesubscribers
toanewloanoverandabovetheredeemableannuityorinterestuponthe
credit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted,
not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed, but as an
additionalencouragementtothelender.
2007 [33] Annuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different
ways; either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French
are called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are
granted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant dis-
burthensthepublicrevenuesofarasitwasaffectedbyhisannuity. When
annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public revenue
does not commence till the death of all annuitants comprehended in one
lot,whichmaysometimesconsistoftwentyorthirtypersons,ofwhomthe G.ed.p918
survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who die before them, the
last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the whole lot. Upon the same
revenue more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities
forseparatelives. Anannuity,witharightofsurvivorship,isreallyworth
more than an equal annuity for a separate life, and from the confidence
whicheverymannaturallyhasinhisowngoodfortune,theprincipleupon
which is founded the success of all lotteries, such an annuity generally
sellsforsomethingmorethanitisworth. Incountrieswhereitisusualfor
government to raise money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this
accountgenerallypreferredtoannuitiesforseparatelives. Theexpedient
which will raise most money is almost always preferred to that which is
likely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the public
revenue.
2008 [34] In France a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in
annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by
the Parliament of Bordeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt of
France is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres, of which
the capital for which annuities for lives had been granted is supposed to
amounttothreehundredmillions,theeighthpartofthewholepublicdebt.
Theannuitiesthemselvesarecomputedtoamounttothirtymillionsayear,

having been presented by so very respectable a body as approximations
to the truth, they may, I apprehend, be considered as such. It is not the
differentdegreesofanxietyinthetwogovernmentsofFranceandEngland
for the liberation of the public revenue which occasions this difference in
theirrespectivemodesofborrowing. Itarisesaltogetherfromthedifferent
viewsandinterestsofthelenders.
2009 [35] In England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile
716 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
city in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance
moneytogovernment. Byadvancingittheydonotmeantodiminish,but,
on the contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals, and unless they ex-
pected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a new
loan, they never would subscribe. But if by advancing their money they
were to purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only, G.ed.p919
whether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so
likelytosellthemwithaprofit. Annuitiesupontheirownlivestheywould
always sell with loss, because no man will give for an annuity upon the
lifeofanother,whoseageandstateofhealtharenearlythesamewithhis
own, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An an-
nuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal value
to the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish from the
moment it is granted, and continues to do so more and more as long as it
subsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferable stock
as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always
thesame,orverynearlythesame.
2010 [36] In France, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city,
merchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance
money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the farmers
general,thereceiversofthetaxeswhicharenotinfarm,thecourtbankers,
etc.,makethegreaterpartofthosewhoadvancetheirmoneyinallpublic
exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but of great
wealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud to marry their
equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them. They frequently
resolve, therefore, to live bachelors, and having neither any families of
theirown,normuchregardforthoseoftheirrelations,whomtheyarenot
always very fond of acknowledging, they desire only to live in splendour
during their own time, and are not unwilling that their fortune should

year, money sufficient for carrying on the war, and by the practice of per-
petually funding they are enabled, with the smallest possible increase of
taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum of money. In great em-
pires the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote from
thesceneofaction,feel,manyofthem,scarceanyinconveniencyfromthe
war; but enjoy, at their ease, the amusement of reading in the newspa-
pers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this amusement
compensates the small difference between the taxes which they pay on
account of the war, and those which they had been accustomed to pay in
time of peace. They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace,

the old revenue, together with the new taxes, produce some surplus rev-

of the money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally
something which was neither intended nor expected, and is therefore sel-
dom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen not so much
from any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was neces-
sary for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them, as
fromasubsequentreductionofthatinterest. ThatofHollandin1655,and
that of the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed in this manner.
Hencetheusualinsufficiencyofsuchfunds.
2014 [40] Duringthemostprofoundpeacevariouseventsoccurwhichrequirean
extraordinary expense, and government finds it always more convenient
to defray this expense by misapplying the sinking fund than by impos-
ing a new tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the
people. It occasions always some murmur, and meets with some opposi- G.ed.p921
tion. Themoretaxesmayhavebeenmultiplied,thehighertheymayhave
been raised upon every different subject of taxation; the more loudly the
peoplecomplainofeverynewtax,themoredifficultitbecomes,too,either
to find out new subjects of taxation, or to raise much higher the taxes
already imposed upon the old. A momentary suspension of the payment
of debt is not immediately felt by the people, and occasions neither mur-
mur nor complaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious
and easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty. The more the
718 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
publicdebtsmayhavebeenaccumulated,themorenecessaryitmayhave
become to study to reduce them, the more dangerous, the more ruinous
it may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund; the less likely is the
public debt to be reduced to any considerable degree, the more likely, the
more certainly is the sinking fund to be misapplied towards defraying all

2015 [41] InGreatBritain,fromthetimethatwehadfirstrecoursetotheruinous
expedientofperpetualfunding, thereductionofthepublicdebtintimeof
peace has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of war.
It was in the war which began in 1688, and was concluded by the Treaty
of Ryswick in 1697, that the foundation of the present enormous debt of
GreatBritainwasfirstlaid.
2016 [42] On the 31st of December 1697, the public debts of Great Britain, fun-
dedandunfunded,amountedto21,515,742l.13s.81d.Agreatpartofthose
2
debts had been contracted upon short anticipations, and some part upon
annuities for lives, so that before the 31st of December 1701, in less than
four years, there had partly been paid off, and partly reverted to the pub-
lic, the sum of 5,121,041l.12s.03d.; a greater reduction of the public debt
4
than has ever since been brought about in so short a period of time. The
remainingdebt,therefore,amountedonlyto16,394,701l.1s.71d.
4
2017 [43] In the war which began in 1709., and which was concluded by the
Treaty of Utrecht, the public debts were still more accumulated. On the
31st of December 1714, they amounted to 53,681,076l.5s.6 1 d. The sub-
12
scriptionintotheSouthSeafundoftheshortandlongannuitiesincreased
the capital of the public debts, so that on the 31st of December, 1722 it G.ed.p922
amountedto55,282,978l.1s.35d.Thereductionofthedebtbeganin1723,
6
and went on so slowly that, on the 31st of December 1739, during seven-
teen years of profound peace, the whole sum paid off was no more than
8,328,354l.17s.11 1 d., the capital of the public debt at that time amount-
12
ingto46,954,623l.3s.4 7 d.
12
2018 [44] The Spanish war, which began in 1739, and the French war which
soon followed it occasioned further increase of the debt, which, on the
31st of December 1748, after the war had been concluded by the Treaty
of Aix la Chapelle, amounted to 78,293,313l.1s.103d. The most pro-
4
found peace of seventeen years continuance had taken no more than
8,328,354l.17s.11 3 d. from it. A war of less than nine years’ continuance

2019 [45] During the administration of Mr. Pelham, the interest of the public
debt was reduced, or at least measures were taken for reducing it, from
four to three per cent; the sinking fund was increased, and some part
of the public debt was paid off. In 1755, before the breaking out of the
719 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
late war, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 72,289,673l. On
the 5th of January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt
amounted to 122,603,336l.8s.21d. The unfunded debt has been stated at

13,927,589l.2s.2d.Buttheexpenseoccasionedbythewardidnotendwith
theconclusionofthepeace,sothatthough,onthe5thofJanuary1764,the
funded debt was increased (partly by a new loan, and partly by funding a
part of the unfunded debt) to 129,586,789l.10s.13d., there still remained

(according to the very well informed author of the Considerations on the
TradeandFinancesofGreatBritain)anunfundeddebtwhichwasbrought
to account in that and the following year of 9,975,017l.12s.215d. In 1764,
44
therefore,thepublicdebtofGreatBritain,fundedandunfundedtogether,
amounted, according to this author, to 139,516,807l.2s.4d. The annuities
for lives, too, which had been granted as premiums to the subscribers to
thenewloansin1757,estimatedatfourteenyears’purchase,werevalued
at 472,500l.; and the annuities for long terms of years, granted as premi- G.ed.p923
ums likewise in 1761 and 1762, estimated at 271 years purchase, were
2
valuedat6,826,875l.Duringapeaceofaboutsevenyears’continuance,the
prudent and truly patriot administration of Mr. Pelham was not able to
pay off an old debt of six millions. During a war of nearly the same con-
tinuance,anewdebtofmorethanseventy-fivemillionswascontracted.
2020 [46] On the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amoun-
ted to 124,996,086l.1s.61d. The unfunded, exclusive of a large civil list

what has been received from the bank, the East India Company, and the

more than five millions. The debt, therefore, which since the peace has
been paid out of the savings the ordinary revenue of the state, has not,
one year with another, amounted to half a million a year. The sinking G.ed.p924
fund has, no doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the
debt which has been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per
cents to three per cents, and by the annuities for lives which have fallen
in,and,ifpeaceweretocontinue,amillion,perhaps,mightnowbeannu-
ally spared out of it towards the discharge of the debt. Another million,
accordingly, was paid in the course of last year; but, at the same time, a
new civil list debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in a new war

2021 [47] The public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particu-
larly those of England, have by one author been represented as the accu-
mulationof a greatcapital superadded to theother capitalof thecountry,
bymeansofwhichitstradeisextended,itsmanufacturesmultiplied,and
itslandscultivatedandimprovedmuchbeyondwhattheycouldhavebeen
by means of that other capital only. He does not consider that the cap-
ital which the first creditors of the public advanced to government was,
from the moment in which they advanced it, a certain portion of the an-
nualproduceturnedawayfromservinginthefunctionofacapitaltoserve
in that of a revenue; from maintaining productive labourers to maintain
unproductive ones, and to be spent and wasted, generally in the course
of the year, without even the hope of any future reproduction. In return
for the capital which they advanced they obtained, indeed, an annuity in
the public funds in most cases of more than equal value. This annuity,
no doubt, replaced to them their capital, and enabled them to carry on
their trade and business to the same or perhaps to a greater extent than
before; that is, they were enabled either to borrow of other people a new
capital upon the credit of this annuity, or by selling it to get from other

peopleanewcapitaloftheirownequalorsuperiortothatwhichtheyhad
advanced to government. This new capital, however, which they in this
manner either bought or borrowed of other people, must have existed in
the country before, and must have been employed, as all capitals are, in G.ed.p925
maintainingproductivelabour. Whenitcameintothehandsofthosewho
hadadvancedtheirmoneytogovernment,thoughitwasinsomerespects
a new capital to them, it was not so to the country, but was only a capital
withdrawn from certain employments in or to be turned towards others.
Thoughitreplacedtothemwhattheyhadadvancedtogovernment,itdid
not replace it to the country. Had they not advanced this capital to gov-
ernment, there would have been in the country two capitals, two portions
oftheannualproduce,insteadofone,employedinmaintainingproductive
labour.
2022 [48] When for defraying the expense of government a revenue is raised
within the year from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain
portion of the revenue of private people is only turned away from main-
taining one species of unproductive labour towards maintaining another.
Some part of what they pay in those taxes might no doubt have been ac-
cumulated into capital, and consequently employed in maintaining pro-
ductive labour; but the greater part would probably have been spent and
consequently employed in maintaining unproductive labour. The public
expense, however, when defrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders more
orlessthefurtheraccumulationofnewcapital;butitdoesnotnecessarily
occasionthedestructionofanyactuallyexistingcapital.
2023 [49] When the public expense is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the
annualdestructionofsomecapitalwhichhadbeforeexistedinthecountry;
bytheperversionofsomeportionoftheannualproducewhichhadbefore
beendestinedforthemaintenanceofproductivelabourtowardsthatofun-
productivelabour. Asinthiscase,however,thetaxesarelighterthanthey
would have been had a revenue sufficient for defraying the same expense
beenraisedwithintheyear,theprivaterevenueofindividualsisnecessar-
ily less burdened, and consequently their ability to save and accumulate
some part of that revenue into capital is a good deal less impaired. If the
method of funding destroys more old capital, it at the same time hinders
less the accumulation or acquisition of new capital than that of defraying
thepublicexpensebyarevenueraisedwithintheyear. Underthesystem
offunding,thefrugalityandindustryofprivatepeoplecanmoreeasilyre-
pair the breaches which the waste and extravagance of government may
occasionallymakeinthegeneralcapitalofthesociety.
2024 [50] It is only during the continuance of war, however, that the system of
funding has this advantage over the other system. Were the expense of
war to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the taxes
from which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer G.ed.p926
than the war. The ability of private people to accumulate, though less
duringthewar,wouldhavebeengreaterduringthepeacethanunderthe
722 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
systemoffunding. Warwouldnotnecessarilyhaveoccasionedthedestruc-
tionofanyoldcapitals,andpeacewouldhaveoccasionedtheaccumulation
ofmanymorenew. Warswouldingeneralbemorespeedilyconcluded,and
less wantonly undertaken. The people feeling, during the continuance of
the war, the complete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it, and gov-
ernment, in order to humour them, would not be under the necessity of
carrying it on longer than it was necessary to do so. The foresight of the
heavyandunavoidableburdensofwarwouldhinderthepeoplefromwan-
tonly calling for it when there was no real or solid interest to fight for.
The seasons during which the ability of private people to accumulate was
somewhat impaired would occur more rarely, and be of shorter continu-
ance. Those, on the contrary, during which the ability was in the highest
vigour would be of much longer duration than they can well be under the
systemoffunding.
2025 [51] Whenfunding,besides,hasmadeacertainprogress,themultiplication

is the right hand which pays the left. The money does not go out of the G.ed.p927

whether employed in agriculture, manufactures, or commerce. The man-
agement of those two original sources of revenue belong to two different
setsofpeople;theproprietorsofland,andtheownersoremployersofcap-

2028 [54] The proprietor of land is interested for the sake of his own revenue to
keep his estate in as good condition as he can, by building and repairing

of the public has no doubt a general interest in the prosperity of the agri-
culture, manufactures, and commerce of the country, and consequently in
the good condition of its lands, and in the good management of its capital
stock. Should there be any general failure or declension in any of these
things, the produce of the different taxes might no longer be sufficient to

either weakness or desolation into every other country should prove alto-

2032 [58] The system of taxation established in those different countries, it may
be said, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought
to be remembered that, when the wisest government has exhausted all
the proper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have
recourse to improper ones. The wise republic of Holland has upon some G.ed.p929
occasions been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the
greater part of those of Spain. Another war begun before any consider-
ableliberationofthepublicrevenuehadbeenbroughtabout,andgrowing
in its progress as expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible neces-
sity, render the British system of taxation as oppressive as that of Hol-
land, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of
taxation,indeed,ithashithertogivensolittleembarrassmenttoindustry
that,duringthecourseevenofthemostexpensivewars,thefrugalityand
good conduct of individuals seem to have been able, by saving and accu-
mulation, to repair all the breaches which the waste and extravagance of
government had made in the general capital of the society. At the conclu-
sion of the late war, the most expensive that Great Britain ever waged,
heragriculturewasasflourishing,hermanufacturersasnumerousandas
fully employed, and her commerce as extensive as they had ever been be-
fore. The capital, therefore, which supported all those different branches
of industry must have been equal to what it had ever been before. Since

2033 [59] When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree,
there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and
725 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been
broughtaboutbybankruptcy;sometimesbyanavowedone,butalwaysby
arealone,thoughfrequentlybyapretendedpayment.
2034 [60] The raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual
expedientbywhicharealpublicbankruptcyhasbeendisguisedunderthe
appearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example, should
eitherbyActofParliamentorRoyalProclamationberaisedtothedenom-
inationofashilling, andtwentysixpencestothatofapoundsterling; the
person who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty shillings, G.ed.p930
or near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with twenty six-
pences, or with something less than two ounces. A national debt of about
ahundredandtwenty-eightmillions,nearlythecapitalofthefundedand
unfunded debt of Great Britain, might in this manner be paid with about
sixty-four millions of our present money. It would indeed be a pretended
payment only, and the creditors of the public would really be defrauded
of ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them. The calamity, too,
wouldextendmuchfurtherthantothecreditorsofthepublic,andthoseof
every private person would suffer a proportionable loss; and this without
anyadvantage,butinmostcaseswithagreatadditionalloss,tothecred-
itors of the public. If the creditors of the public, indeed, were generally
much in debt to other people, they might in some measure compensate
their loss by paying their creditors in the same coin in which the public
had paid them. But in most countries the creditors of the public are, the
greater part of them, wealthy people, who stand more in the relation of
creditorsthaninthatofdebtorstowardstherestoftheirfellow-citizens. A
pretended payment of this kind, therefore, instead of alleviating, aggrav-
ates in most cases the loss of the creditors of the public, and without any
advantage to the public, extends the calamity to a great number of other
innocent people. It occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of
thefortunesofprivatepeople,enrichinginmostcasestheidleandprofuse

same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a
fair, open, and avowed bankruptcy is always the measure which is both
least dishonourable to the debtor and least hurtful to the creditor. The

kind,soeasilyseenthrough,andatthesametimesoextremelypernicious.
2035 [61] Almostallstates,however,ancientaswellasmodern,whenreducedto
this necessity have, upon some occasions, played this very juggling trick.
TheRomans, attheendofthefirstPunicwar, reducedtheAs, thecoinor
denomination by which they computed the value of all their other coins,
from containing twelve ounces of copper to contain only two ounces; that
726 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
is, they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination which had always
before expressed the value of twelve ounces. The republic was, in this
manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted with the
sixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and so great a bankruptcy,
weshouldinthepresenttimesbeapttoimagine, musthaveoccasioneda
very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have occasioned any. G.ed.p931
The law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating to the coin, in-
troducedandcarriedthroughtheassemblyofthepeoplebyatribune,and
was probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all the other ancient re-
publics, the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and the great,
who in order to secure their votes at the annual elections, used to lend
themmoneyatexorbitantinterest,which,beingneverpaid,soonaccumu-
lated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for anybody else
topayforhim. Thedebtor,forfearofaverysevereexecution,wasobliged,
without any further gratuity, to vote for the candidate whom the creditor
recommended. Inspiteofallthelaws againstbriberyand corruption, the
bountyofthecandidates,togetherwiththeoccasionaldistributionsofcorn
which were ordered by the senate, were the principal funds from which,
during the latter times of the Roman republic, the poorer citizens derived
theirsubsistence. Todeliverthemselvesfromthissubjectiontotheircred-
itors, the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for an entire
abolition of debts, or for what they called New Tables; that is, for a law
which should entitle them to a complete acquittance upon paying only a
certainproportionoftheiraccumulateddebts. Thelawwhichreducedthe
coin of all denominations to a sixth part of its former value, as it enabled
them to pay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed, was
equivalent to the most advantageous New Tables. In order to satisfy the
people, the rich and the great were, upon several different occasions, ob-
ligedtoconsenttolawsbothforabolishingdebts,andforintroducingNew
Tables; and they probably were induced to consent to this law partly for
the same reason, and partly that, by liberating the public revenue, they
mightrestorevigourtothatgovernmentofwhichtheythemselveshadthe
principal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt
of a hundred and twenty-eight millions to twenty-one millions three hun-
dredandthirty-threethousandthreehundredandthirty-threepoundssix
shillingsandeightpence. InthecourseofthesecondPunicwartheAswas
stillfurtherreduced,first,fromtwoouncesofcoppertooneounce,andaf-
terwardsfromoneouncetohalfanounce;thatis,tothetwenty-fourthpart
of its original value. By combining the three Roman operations into one,
adebtofahundredandtwenty-eightmillionsofourpresentmoneymight
in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of five millions three hun-
dredandthirty-threethousandthreehundredandthirty-threepoundssix G.ed.p932

quantity of silver contained in six shillings and eightpence of our present
money would thus be raised very nearly to the denomination of a pound
sterling. Theadulterationofthestandardhasexactlythesameeffectwith
whattheFrenchcallanaugmentation,oradirectraisingofthedenomin-
ationofthecoin.
2038 [64] An augmentation, or a direct raising of the coin, always is, and from
its nature must be, an open and avowed operation. By means of it pieces
of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same name which had be-
fore been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk. The adulteration
ofthestandard,onthecontrary,hasgenerallybeenaconcealedoperation.
By means of it pieces were issued from the mint of the same denomina-
tions, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the same weight, bulk, and
appearance with pieces which had been current before of much greater
value. When King John of France3, in order to pay his debts, adulterated
hiscoin,alltheofficersofhismintweresworntosecrecy. Bothoperations
are unjust. But a simple augmentation is an injustice of open violence,
whereas the adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud. This latter

2039 [65] In the end of the reign of Henry VIII and in the beginning of that of
Edward VI the English coin was not only raised in its denomination, but
adulterated in its standard. The like frauds were practised in Scotland
duringtheminorityofJamesVI.Theyhaveoccasionallybeenpractisedin

728 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
be brought about without either some very considerable augmentation of
the public revenue, or some equally considerable reduction of the public
expense.
2041 [67] A more equal land-tax, a more equal tax upon the rent of houses, and
such alterations in the present system of customs and excise as those
which have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter might, perhaps,
without increasing the burden of the greater part of the people, but only
distributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole, produce a con-
siderableaugmentationofrevenue. Themostsanguineprojector,however,
could scarce flatter himself that any augmentation of this kind would be

enue altogether, or even of making such progress towards that liberation

lationofthepublicdebtinthenextwar.
2042 [68] By extending the British system of taxation to all the different
provinces of the empire inhabited by people of either British or European
extraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected.
This, however, could scarce, perhaps, be done, consistently with the prin-
ciplesoftheBritishconstitution,withoutadmittingintotheBritishParlia-
ment,orifyouwillintothestatesgeneraloftheBritishempire,afairand
equalrepresentationofallthosedifferentprovinces,thatofeachprovince
bearingthesameproportiontotheproduceofitstaxesastherepresenta-
tion of Great Britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon
Great Britain. The private interest of many powerful individuals, the
confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people seem, indeed, at present, G.ed.p934
to oppose to so great a change such obstacles as it may be very difficult,
perhaps altogether impossible, to surmount. Without, however, pretend-
ing to determine whether such a union be practicable or impracticable, it
may not, perhaps, be improper, in a speculative work of this kind, to con-
siderhowfartheBritishsystemoftaxationmightbeapplicabletoallthe
differentprovincesoftheempire,whatrevenuemightbeexpectedfromit
if so applied, and in what manner a general union of this kind might be
likelytoaffectthehappinessandprosperityofthedifferentprovincescom-
prehended within it. Such a speculation can at worst be regarded but as
anewUtopia,lessamusingcertainly,butnotmoreuselessandchimerical
thantheoldone.
2043 [69] Theland-tax,thestamp-duties,andthedifferentdutiesofcustomsand

2044 [70] Irelandiscertainlyasable,andourAmericanandWestIndianplanta-
tions more able to pay a land-tax than Great Britain. Where the landlord
issubjectneithertotithenorpoor-rate,hemustcertainlybemoreableto
pay such a tax than where he is subject to both those other burdens. The
tithe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind, diminishes
more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord than a land-tax
which really amounted to five shillings in the pound. Such a tithe will be
729 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
found in most cases to amount to more than a fourth part of the real rent
oftheland,orofwhatremainsafterreplacingcompletelythecapitalofthe
farmer, together with his reasonable profit. If all moduses and all impro-
priationsweretakenaway,thecompletechurchtitheofGreatBritainand
Ireland could not well be estimated at less than six or seven millions. If
there was no tithe either in Great Britain or Ireland, the landlords could
affordtopaysixorsevenmillionsadditionalland-taxwithoutbeingmore
burdened than a very great part of them are at present. America pays no
tithe, and could therefore very well afford to pay a land-tax. The lands
in America and the West Indies, indeed, are in general not tenanted nor
leased out to farmers. They could not therefore be assessed according to
any rent-roll. But neither were the lands of Great Britain, in the 4th of
William and Mary, assessed according to any rent-roll, but according to a
very loose and inaccurate estimation. The lands in America might be as-
sessed either in the same manner, or according to an equitable valuation
in consequence of an accurate survey like that which was lately made in
theMilanese,andinthedominionsofAustria,Prussia,andSardinia.

2046 [72] Theextensionofthecustom-houselawsofGreatBritaintoIrelandand
the plantations, provided it was accompanied, as in justice it ought to be,
with an extension of the freedom of trade, would be in the highest de-
gree advantageous to both. All the invidious restraints which at present
oppress the trade of Ireland, the distinction between the enumerated and
non-enumeratedcommoditiesofAmerica,wouldbeentirelyatanend. The
countries north of Cape Finisterre would be as open to every part of the
produce of America as those south of that Cape are to some parts of that
produceatpresent. ThetradebetweenallthedifferentpartsoftheBritish
empirewould,inconsequenceofthisuniformityinthecustom-houselaws,
be as free as the coasting trade of Great Britain is at present. The Brit-
ishempirewouldthusaffordwithinitselfanimmenseinternalmarketfor

require to be varied in any respect according as it was applied to the dif-
ferentprovincesoftheempire. ItmightbeappliedtoIrelandwithoutany
variation, the produce and consumption of that kingdom being exactly of
the same nature with those of Great Britain. In its application to Amer-
ica and the West Indies, of which the produce and consumption are so
verydifferentfromthoseofGreatBritain,somemodificationmightbene- G.ed.p936
cessary in the same manner as in its application to the cyder and beer
countiesofEngland.
2048 [74] Afermentedliquor,forexample,whichiscalledbeer,butwhich,asitis
730 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
made of molasses, bears very little resemblance to our beer, makes a con-
siderable part of the common drink of the people in America. This liquor,
as it can be kept only for a few days, cannot, like our beer, be prepared
and stored up for sale in great breweries; but every private family must
brewitfortheirown use, in thesamemannerastheycooktheirvictuals.
Buttosubjecteveryprivatefamilytotheodiousvisitsandexaminationof
the tax-gatherers, in the same manner as we subject the keepers of ale-
houses and the brewers for public sale, would be altogether inconsistent
with liberty. If for the sake of equality it was thought necessary to lay a
tax upon this liquor, it might be taxed by taxing the material of which it
ismade,eitherattheplaceofmanufacture,or,ifthecircumstancesofthe
traderenderedsuchanexciseimproper,bylayingadutyuponitsimport-
ation into the colony in which it was to be consumed. Besides the duty of
one penny a gallon imposed by the British Parliament upon the importa-
tion of molasses into America, there is a provincial tax of this kind upon
theirimportationintoMassachusettsBay,inshipsbelongingtoanyother
colony, of eightpence the hogshead; and another upon their importation,

leviedinHolland;ornearlyasSirMatthewDeckerproposesthatalltaxes
upon consumable commodities should be levied in England. This mode of
taxation,ithasalreadybeenobserved,whenappliedtoobjectsofaspeedy
consumption is not a very convenient one. It might be adopted, however,
incaseswherenobettercouldbedone.
2049 [75] Sugar, rum, and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere neces-
saries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption,
and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation. If a union
with the colonies were to take place, those commodities might be taxed

the principal commodities with regard to which a union with the colonies
might require some considerable change in the present system of British
taxation.
731 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
2050 [76] What might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxa-
tionextendedtoallthedifferentprovincesoftheempiremightproduce,it
must,nodoubt,bealtogetherimpossibletoascertainwithtolerableexact-
ness. By means of this system there is annually levied in Great Britain,
uponlessthaneightmillionsofpeople,morethantenmillionsofrevenue.
Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and according to the
accountslaidbeforethecongress,thetwelveassociatedprovincesofAmer-
ica contain more than three. Those accounts, however, may have been
exaggerated, in order, perhaps, either to encourage their own people, or
to intimidate those of this country, and we shall suppose, therefore, that
our North American and West Indian colonies taken together contain no
morethanthreemillions;orthatthewholeBritishempire,inEuropeand
America, contains no more than thirteen millions of inhabitants. If upon
lessthaneightmillionsofinhabitantsthissystemoftaxationraisesarev-
enueofmorethantenmillionssterling, itoughtuponthirteenmillionsof
inhabitants to raise a revenue of more than sixteen millions two hundred
andfiftythousandpoundssterling. Fromthisrevenue,supposingthatthis
system could produce it, must be deducted the revenue usually raised in
Ireland and the plantations for defraying the expense of their respective
civil governments. The expense of the civil and military establishment of
Ireland, together with the interest of the public debt, amounts, at a me-
dium of the two years which ended March 1775, to something less than
seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year. By a very exact account
of the revenue of the principal colonies of America and the West Indies,
it amounted, before the commencement of the present disturbances, to a
hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds. In this account,
however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of all our late G.ed.p938
acquisitions both upon the continent and in the islands is omitted, which
may perhaps make a difference of thirty or forty thousand pounds. For
the sake of even numbers, therefore, let us suppose that the revenue ne-
cessaryforsupportingthecivilgovernmentofIrelandandtheplantations
may amount to a million. There would remain consequently a revenue of
fifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds to be applied to-
wards defraying the general expense of the empire, and towards paying
thepublicdebt. ButiffromthepresentrevenueofGreatBritainamillion
could in peaceable times be spared towards the payment of that debt, six
millionstwohundredandfiftythousandpoundscouldverywellbespared
from this improved revenue. This great sinking fund, too, might be aug-
mented every year by the interest of the debt which had been discharged
the year before, and might in this manner increase so very rapidly as to
be sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt, and thus to re-
store completely the at present debilitated and languishing vigour of the
empire. In the meantime the people might be relieved from some of the
mostburdensometaxes;fromthosewhichareimposedeitheruponthene-
cessariesoflife,oruponthematerialsofmanufacture. Thelabouringpoor

2051 [77] The revenue arising from this system of taxation, however, might not
immediatelyincreaseinproportiontothenumberofpeoplewhoweresub-
jectedtoit. Greatindulgencewouldforsometimebeduetothoseprovinces
oftheempirewhichwerethussubjectedtoburdenstowhichtheyhadnot
before been accustomed, and even when the same taxes came to be levied
everywhere as exactly as possible, they would not everywhere produce a
revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a poor country the
consumptionoftheprincipalcommoditiessubjecttothedutiesofcustoms
and excise is very small, and in a thinly inhabited country the opportun-
itiesofsmugglingareverygreat. Theconsumptionofmaltliquorsamong
theinferiorranksofpeopleinScotlandisverysmall, andtheexciseupon
malt, beer, and ale produces less there than in England in proportion to
the numbers of the people and the rate of the duties, which upon malt is
different on account of a supposed difference of quality. In these partic-
ular branches of the excise there is not, I apprehend, much more smug-
gling in the one country than in the other. The duties upon the distillery,
and the greater part of the duties of customs, in proportion to the num- G.ed.p939
bers of people in the respective countries, produce less in Scotland than
in England, not only on account of the smaller consumption of the taxed
commodities,butofthemuchgreaterfacilityofsmuggling. InIrelandthe
inferior ranks of people are still poorer than in Scotland, and many parts
of the country are almost as thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the
consumption of the taxed commodities might, in proportion to the num-
ber of the people, be still less thanScotland, and the facility ofsmuggling
nearlythesame. InAmericaandtheWestIndiesthewhitepeopleevenof
the lowest rank are in much better circumstances than those of the same
rank in England, and their consumption of all the luxuries in which they
usually indulge themselves is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed,
whomakethegreaterpartoftheinhabitantsbothofthesoutherncolonies
uponthecontinentandoftheWestIndiaislands,astheyareinastateof
slavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people either
in Scotland or Ireland. We must not, however, upon that account, ima-
gine that they are worse fed, or that their consumption of articles which
might be subjected to moderate duties is less than that even of the lower
ranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is the
interestoftheirmasterthattheyshouldbefedwellandkeptingoodheart
in the same manner as it is his interest that his working cattle should be

so. Theblacksaccordinglyhavealmosteverywheretheirallowanceofrum
and molasses or spruce beer in the same manner as the white servants,
andthisallowancewouldnotprobablybewithdrawnthoughthosearticles

commodities,therefore,inproportiontothenumberofinhabitants,would
probablybeasgreatinAmericaandtheWestIndiesasinanypartofthe
British empire. The opportunities of smuggling, indeed, would be much
greater; America, in proportion to the extent of the country, being much
more thinly inhabited than either Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue,
however, which is at present raised by the different duties upon malt and
maltliquorsweretobeleviedbyasingledutyuponmalt,theopportunity
of smuggling in the most important branch of the excise would be almost
entirelytakenaway: andifthedutiesofcustoms,insteadofbeingimposed

weresubjectedtotheexciselaws,theopportunityofsmuggling,thoughnot
so entirely taken away, would be very much diminished. In consequence
of those two, apparently, very simple and easy alterations, the duties of
customs and excise might probably produce a revenue as great in propor-
tiontotheconsumptionofthemostthinlyinhabitedprovinceastheydoat G.ed.p940

But without gold and silver, it is added, there is no possibility of paying
taxes. We already get all the gold and silver which they have. How is it
possibletodrawfromthemwhattheyhavenot?
2053 [79] The present scarcity of gold and silver money in America is not the
effect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people there
to purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of labour are so
much higher, and the price of provisions so much lower than in England,
the greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase

2055 [81] Thedomesticbusinessofeverycountry,ithasbeenshowninthesecond
book of this Inquiry, may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by
meansofapapercurrencywithnearlythesamedegreeofconveniencyas
by gold and silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could
always employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater
stock than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expense
of so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver, and rather
734 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
to employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary
for purchasing those metals in purchasing the instruments of trade, the
materials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the iron-
work necessary for building and extending their settlements and planta-
tions; in purchasing, not dead stock, but active and productive stock. The
colonygovernmentsfinditfortheirinteresttosupplythepeoplewithsuch
a quantity of papermoney as is fully sufficient and generally more than
sufficient for transacting their domestic business. Some of those govern-
ments, that of Pennsylvania particularly, derive a revenue from lending
thispaper-moneytotheirsubjectsataninterestofsomuchpercent. Oth-
ers, like that of Massachusetts Bay, advance upon extraordinary emer-
gencies a paper-money of this kind for defraying the public expense, and G.ed.p941
afterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the colony, redeem it at the
depreciatedvaluetowhichitgraduallyfalls. In17474,thatcolonypaid,in
thismanner,thegreaterpartofitspublicdebtswiththetenthpartofthe

planters to save the expense of employing gold and silver money in their
domestic transactions, and it suits the conveniency of the colony govern-
ments to supply them with a medium which, though attended with some
very considerable disadvantages, enables them to save that expense. The
redundancy of paper-money necessarily banishes gold and silver from the
domestictransactionsofthecolonies,forthesamereasonthatithasban-
ished those metals from the greater part of the domestic transactions in
Scotland; and in both countries it is not the poverty, but the enterprising
and projecting spirit of the people, their desire of employing all the stock
which they can get as active and productive stock, which has occasioned
thisredundancyofpaper-money.
2056 [82] In the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with
Great Britain, gold and silver are more or less employed exactly in pro-
portion as they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are not
necessary they seldom appear. Where they are necessary they are gener-
allyfound.
2057 [83] In the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies the
British goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long
credit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price.
It is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and
silver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods
whichhiscorrespondentshadsoldtohiminsomeothersortofgoodswhich
he might happen to deal in than in money. Such a merchant would have
nooccasiontokeepanypartofhisstockbyhimunemployed,andinready
money, for answering occasional demands. He could have, at all times, a
larger quantity of goods in his shop or warehouse, and he could deal to a
greater extent. But it seldom happens to be convenient for all the corres-

merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular
set of correspondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive payment
for the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco than in gold and
silver. They expect to make a profit by the sale of the tobacco. They could
make none by that of the gold and silver. Gold and silver, therefore, very
seldom appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco
colonies. MarylandandVirginiahaveaslittleoccasionforthosemetalsin
theirforeignasintheirdomesticcommerce. Theyaresaid,accordingly,to
havelessgoldandsilvermoneythananyothercoloniesinAmerica. They
are reckoned, however, as thriving, and consequently as rich, as any of
theirneighbours.
2058 [84] Inthenortherncolonies,Pennsylvania,NewYork,NewJersey,thefour
governments of New England, etc., the value of their own produce which
theyexporttoGreatBritainisnotequaltothatofthemanufactureswhich
theyimportfortheirownuse,andforthatofsomeoftheothercoloniesto
which they are the carriers. A balance, therefore, must be paid to the
mothercountryingoldandsilver,andthisbalancetheygenerallyfind.
2059 [85] In the sugar colonies the value of the produce annually exported to
Great Britain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from
thence. If the sugar and rum annually sent to the mother country were
paidforinthosecolonies,GreatBritainwouldbeobligedtosendoutevery
yearaverylargebalanceinmoney,andthetradetotheWestIndieswould,
by a certain species of politicians, be considered as extremely disadvant-
ageous. But it so happens that many of the principal proprietors of the
sugarplantationsresideinGreatBritain. Theirrentsareremittedtothem
in sugar and rum, the produce of their estates. The sugar and rum which
the West India merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own ac-
count are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell there.
A balance, therefore, must necessarily be paid to them in gold and silver,
andthisbalance,too,isgenerallyfound.
2060 [86] Thedifficultyandirregularityofpaymentfromthedifferentcoloniesto
GreatBritainhavenotbeenatallinproportiontothegreatnessorsmall-
ness of the balances which were respectively due from them. Payments
haveingeneralbeenmoreregularfromthenorthernthanfromthetobacco
colonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large balance in
money, while the latter have either paid no balance, or a much smaller
one. The difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar colonies
has been greater or less in proportion, not so much to the extent of the G.ed.p943
balances respectively due from them, as to the quantity of uncultivated
land which they contained; that is, to the greater or smaller temptation
which the planters have been under of overtrading, or of undertaking the
settlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste land than suited
theextentoftheircapitals. ThereturnsfromthegreatislandofJamaica,
736 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
wherethereisstillmuchuncultivatedland,have,uponthisaccount,been
in general more irregular and uncertain than those from the smaller is-
lands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christophers, which have for these
many years been completely cultivated, and have, upon that account, af-
fordedlessfieldforthespeculationsoftheplanter. Thenewacquisitionsof
Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincents, and Dominica have opened a new field for
speculations of this kind, and the returns from those islands have of late
beenasirregularanduncertainasthosefromthegreatislandofJamaica.
2061 [87] It is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occasions, in the
greater part of them, the present scarcity of gold and silver money. Their
greatdemandforactiveandproductivestockmakesitconvenientforthem
to have as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them upon that ac-
count to content themselves with a cheaper though less commodious in-
strument of commerce than gold and silver. They are thereby enabled to
convertthevalueofthatgoldandsilverintotheinstrumentsoftrade,into
the materials of clothing, into household furniture, and into the ironwork
necessaryforbuildingandextendingtheirsettlementsandplantations. In
those branches of business which cannot be transacted without gold and
silver money, it appears that they can always find the necessary quant-
ity of those metals; and if they frequently do not find it, their failure is
generally the effect, not of their necessary poverty, but of their unneces-
sary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are poor that their
payments are irregular and uncertain, but because they are too eager to
becomeexcessivelyrich. Thoughallthatpartoftheproduceofthecolony
taxes whichwas over andabove what was necessary for defrayingthe ex-
pense of their own civil and military establishments were to be remitted
to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have abundantly where-
withal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals. They would in
this case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their surplus produce,
withwhichtheynowpurchaseactiveandproductivestock,fordeadstock.
In transacting their domestic business they would be obliged to employ
a costly instead of a cheap instrument of commerce, and the expense of
purchasingthiscostlyinstrumentmightdampsomewhatthevivacityand
ardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of land. It might
not, however, be necessary to remit any part of the American revenue in
gold and silver. It might be remitted in bills drawn upon and accepted
by particular merchants or companies in Great Britain to whom a part of G.ed.p944
the surplus produce of America had been consigned, who would pay into
the treasury the American revenue in money, after having themselves re-
ceivedthevalueofitingoods;andthewholebusinessmightfrequentlybe
transactedwithoutexportingasingleounceofgoldorsilverfromAmerica.
2062 [88] It is not contrary to justice that both Ireland and America should con-
tribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain. That
debthasbeencontractedinsupportofthegovernmentestablishedbythe
Revolution,agovernmenttowhichtheProtestantsofIrelandowe,notonly

theirpresentcharters,andconsequentlytheirpresentconstitution,andto
which all the colonies of America owe the liberty, security, and property
whichtheyhaveeversinceenjoyed. Thatpublicdebthasbeencontracted

of the empire; the immense debt contracted in the late war in particular,
and a great part of that contracted in the war before, were both properly
contractedindefenceofAmerica.
2063 [89] By a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, besides the free-
dom of trade, other advantages much more important, and which would
much more than compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany
thatunion. BytheunionwithEnglandthemiddlingandinferiorranksof
peopleinScotlandgainedacompletedeliverancefromthepowerofanar-
istocracywhichhadalwaysbeforeoppressedthem. ByaunionwithGreat
Britain the greater part of the people of all ranks in Ireland would gain
anequallycompletedeliverancefromamuchmoreoppressivearistocracy;
an aristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and re-
spectable distinctions of birth and fortune, but in the most odious of all
distinctions,thoseofreligiousandpoliticalprejudices;distinctionswhich,
morethananyother,animateboththeinsolenceoftheoppressorsandthe
hatred and indignation of the oppressed, and which commonly render the
inhabitantsofthesamecountrymorehostiletooneanotherthanthoseof
different countries ever are. Without a union with Great Britain the in-
habitantsofIrelandarenotlikelyformanyagestoconsiderthemselvesas
onepeople.
2064 [90] Nooppressivearistocracyhaseverprevailedinthecolonies. Eventhey,
however, would, in point of happiness and tranquility, gain considerably G.ed.p945
byaunionwithGreatBritain. Itwould,atleast,deliverthemfromthose
rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small demo-
cracies,andwhichhavesofrequentlydividedtheaffectionsoftheirpeople,
anddisturbedthetranquillityoftheirgovernments,intheirformsonearly
democratical. In the case of a total separation from Great Britain, which,
unless prevented by a union of this kind, seems very likely to take place,
thosefactionswouldbetentimesmorevirulentthanever. Beforethecom-
mencement of the present disturbances, the coercive power of the mother
countryhadalwaysbeenabletorestrainthosefactionsfrombreakingout
intoanythingworsethangrossbrutalityandinsult. Ifthatcoercivepower
were entirely taken away, they would probably soon break out into open
violenceandbloodshed. Inallgreatcountrieswhichareunitedunderone
uniform government, the spirit of party commonly prevails less in the re-
mote provinces than in the centre of the empire. The distance of those
provinces from the capital, from the principal seat of the great scramble
of faction and ambition, makes them enter less into the views of any of
738 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
the contending parties, and renders them more indifferent and impartial
spectators of the conduct of all. The spirit of party prevails less in Scot-
landthaninEngland. Inthecaseofaunionitwouldprobablyprevailless
in Ireland than in Scotland, and the colonies would probably soon enjoy a
degree of concord and unanimity at present unknown in any part of the
Britishempire. BothIrelandandthecolonies, indeed, wouldbesubjected
toheaviertaxesthananywhichtheyatpresentpay. Inconsequence,how-
ever, of a diligent and faithful application of the public revenue towards
the discharge of the national debt, the greater part of those taxes might
notbeoflongcontinuance, andthepublicrevenueofGreatBritainmight
soon be reduced to what was necessary for maintaining a moderate peace
establishment.
2065 [91] The territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, the undoubted
right of the crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain, might
be rendered another source of revenue more abundant, perhaps, than all
those already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more fer-
tile, more extensive, and, in proportion to their extent, much richer and
morepopulousthanGreatBritain. Inordertodrawagreatrevenuefrom
them, it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system of
taxationintocountrieswhicharealreadysufficientlyandmorethansuffi-
cientlytaxed. Itmight,perhaps,bemorepropertolightenthantoaggrav-
ate the burden of those unfortunate countries, and to endeavour to draw
a revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes, but by preventing the G.ed.p946
embezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they
alreadypay.
2066 [92] If it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any con-
siderable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources above men-
tioned, the only resource which can remain to her is a diminution of her
expense. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public
revenue, though in both there may be still room for improvement, Great
Britain seems to be at least as economical as any of her neighbours. The
militaryestablishmentwhichshemaintainsforherowndefenceintimeof
peaceismoremoderatethanthatofanyEuropeanstatewhichcanpretend
torivalhereitherinwealthorinpower. Noneofthosearticles, therefore,
seem to admit of any considerable reduction of expense. The expense of
the peace establishment of the colonies was, before the commencement of
thepresentdisturbances,veryconsiderable,andisanexpensewhichmay,
and if no revenue can be drawn from them ought certainly to be saved al-
together. Thisconstantexpenseintimeofpeace, thoughverygreat, isin-
significantincomparisonwithwhatthedefenceofthecolonieshascostus
intimeofwar. Thelastwar,whichwasundertakenaltogetheronaccount
of the colonies, cost Great Britain, it has already been observed, upwards
ofninetymillions. TheSpanishwarof1739wasprincipallyundertakenon
their account, in which, and in the French war that was the consequence
of it, Great Britain spent upwards of forty millions, a great part of which
739 TheWealthofNations AdamSmith
ought justly to be charged to the colonies. In those two wars the colon-
iescostGreatBritainmuchmorethandoublethesumwhichthenational
debt amounted to before the commencement of the first of them. Had it
notbeenforthosewarsthatdebtmight,andprobablywouldbythistime,
havebeencompletelypaid;andhaditnotbeenforthecolonies,theformer
of those wars might not, and the latter certainly would not have been un-
dertaken. Itwasbecausethecoloniesweresupposedtobeprovincesofthe
British empire that this expense was laid out upon them. But countries
which contribute neither revenue nor military force towards the support
of the empire cannot be considered as provinces. They may perhaps be
consideredasappendages,asasortofsplendidandshowyequipageofthe
empire. But if the empire can no longer support the expense of keeping
up this equipage, it ought certainly to lay it down; and if it cannot raise
itsrevenueinproportiontoitsexpense,itought,atleast,toaccommodate
its expense to its revenue. If the colonies, notwithstanding their refusal
to submit to British taxes, are still to be considered as provinces of the
British empire, their defence in some future war may cost Great Britain
as great an expense as it ever has done in any former war. The rulers of
GreatBritainhave,formorethanacenturypast,amusedthepeoplewith G.ed.p947
theimaginationthattheypossessedagreatempireonthewestsideofthe
Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only.
