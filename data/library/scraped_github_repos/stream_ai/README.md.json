Our system's end goal is to use real-time video, gcode and data from the digital twin sensors to monitor the printing process, track the extruder tip's position, identify printing errors and make real-time adjustments to the print based on the measured width of the extruded material.\n\nThere are many sources of error in tracking the tip. To counter these we created methods to detect, process and correct tips.
