It includes guidelines on what to work on, such as extending core modules, fixing bugs, adding usage examples, adding experimental features, and improving code quality and documentation. The file also provides details on each module, including data loaders, node parsers, text splitters, document/index/KV stores, managed index, vector stores, retrievers, query engines, query transforms, token usage optimizers, node postprocessors, and output parsers. Additionally, the file includes a development guideline section that covers environment setup, validating changes, formatting/linting, testing, creating example notebooks, and creating a pull request.\n========================\nGot output: The content of the index page provides information about LlamaIndex, a data framework for LLM applications. It explains why LlamaIndex is useful for augmenting LLM models with private or domain-specific data that may be distributed across different applications and data stores. LlamaIndex offers tools such as data connectors, data indexes, engines, and data agents to ingest, structure, and access data. It is designed for beginners as well as advanced users who can customize and extend its modules. The page also provides installation instructions, tutorials, and links to the LlamaIndex ecosystem and associated projects.\n========================\n\\[tool\\_latest\\_index\\] A: The content of the \\`latest\\_index.html\\` page provides comprehensive information about LlamaIndex, a data framework for LLM applications.
