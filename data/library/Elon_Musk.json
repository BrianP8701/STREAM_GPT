I\u2019d gotten to\nthe restaurant first and settled down with a gin and tonic, knowing Musk\nwould\u2014as ever\u2014be late. After about fifteen minutes, Musk showed up\nwearing leather shoes, designer jeans, and a plaid dress shirt. Musk stands\nsix foot one but ask anyone who knows him and they\u2019ll confirm that he\nseems much bigger than that. He\u2019s absurdly broad-shouldered, sturdy, and\nthick. You\u2019d figure he would use this frame to his advantage and perform an\nalpha-male strut when entering a room. Instead, he tends to be almost\nsheepish. It\u2019s head tilted slightly down while walking, a quick handshake\nhello after reaching the table, and then butt in seat. From there, Musk needs\na few minutes before he warms up and looks at ease.\nMusk asked me to dinner for a negotiation of sorts. Eighteen months\nearlier, I\u2019d informed him of my plans to write a book about him, and he\u2019d\ninformed me of his plans not to cooperate. His rejection stung but thrust me\ninto dogged reporter mode. If I had to do this book without him, so be it.\nPlenty of people had left Musk\u2019s companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, and\nwould talk, and I already knew a lot of his friends. The interviews followed\none after another, month after month, and two hundred or so people into the\nprocess, I heard from Musk once again. He called me at home and declared\nthat things could go one of two ways: he could make my life very difficult\nor he could help with the project after all. He\u2019d be willing to cooperate if he\ncould read the book before it went to publication, and could add footnotes\nthroughout it. He would not meddle with my text, but he wanted the chance\nto set the record straight in spots that he deemed factually inaccurate. I\nunderstood where this was coming from. Musk wanted a measure of control\nover his life\u2019s story. He\u2019s also wired like a scientist and suffers mental\nanguish at the sight of a factual error. A mistake on a printed page would\ngnaw at his soul\u2014forever. While I could understand his perspective, I could", "not let him read the book, for professional, personal, and practical reasons.\nMusk has his version of the truth, and it\u2019s not always the version of the truth\nthat the rest of the world shares. He\u2019s prone to verbose answers to even the\nsimplest of questions as well, and the thought of thirty-page footnotes\nseemed all too real. Still, we agreed to have dinner, chat all this out, and see\nwhere it left us.\nOur conversation began with a discussion of public-relations people.\nMusk burns through PR staffers notoriously fast, and Tesla was in the\nprocess of hunting for a new communications chief. \u201cWho is the best PR\nperson in the world?\u201d he asked in a very Muskian fashion. Then we talked\nabout mutual acquaintances, Howard Hughes, and the Tesla factory. When\nthe waiter stopped by to take our order, Musk asked for suggestions that\nwould work with his low-carb diet. He settled on chunks of fried lobster\nsoaked in black squid ink. The negotiation hadn\u2019t begun, and Musk was\nalready dishing. He opened up about the major fear keeping him up at night:\nnamely that Google\u2019s cofounder and CEO Larry Page might well have been\nbuilding a fleet of artificial-intelligence-enhanced robots capable of\ndestroying mankind. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about this,\u201d Musk said. It didn\u2019t\nmake Musk feel any better that he and Page were very close friends and that\nhe felt Page was fundamentally a well-intentioned person and not Dr. Evil.\nIn fact, that was sort of the problem. Page\u2019s nice-guy nature left him\nassuming that the machines would forever do our bidding. \u201cI\u2019m not as\noptimistic,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHe could produce something evil by accident.\u201d As\nthe food arrived, Musk consumed it. That is, he didn\u2019t eat it as much as he\nmade it disappear rapidly with a few gargantuan bites. Desperate to keep\nMusk happy and chatting, I handed him a big chunk of steak from my plate.\nThe plan worked . . . for all of ninety seconds. Meat. Hunk. Gone.\nIt took awhile to get Musk off the artificial intelligence doom-and-\ngloom talk and to the subject at hand. Then, as we drifted toward the book,\nMusk started to feel me out, probing exactly why it was that I wanted to\nwrite about him and calculating my intentions. When the moment presented\nitself, I moved in and seized the conversation. Some adrenaline released and\nmixed with the gin, and I launched into what was meant to be a forty-five-\nminute sermon about all the reasons Musk should let me burrow deep into\nhis life and do so while getting exactly none of the controls he wanted in\nreturn. The speech revolved around the inherent limitations of footnotes,\nMusk coming off like a control freak and my journalistic integrity being", "compromised. To my great surprise, Musk cut me off after a couple of\nminutes and simply said, \u201cOkay.\u201d One thing that Musk holds in the highest\nregard is resolve, and he respects people who continue on after being told\nno. Dozens of other journalists had asked him to help with a book before,\nbut I\u2019d been the only annoying asshole who continued on after Musk\u2019s\ninitial rejection, and he seemed to like that.\nThe dinner wound down with pleasant conversation and Musk laying\nwaste to the low-carb diet. A waiter showed up with a giant yellow cotton\ncandy desert sculpture, and Musk dug into it, ripping off handfuls of the\nsugary fluff. It was settled. Musk granted me access to the executives at his\ncompanies, his friends, and his family. He would meet me for dinner once a\nmonth for as long as it took. For the first time, Musk would let a reporter\nsee the inner workings of his world. Two and a half hours after we started,\nMusk put his hands on the table, made a move to get up, and then paused,\nlocked eyes with me, and busted out that incredible question: \u201cDo you think\nI\u2019m insane?\u201d The oddity of the moment left me speechless for a beat, while\nmy every synapse fired trying to figure out if this was some sort of riddle,\nand, if so, how it should be answered artfully. It was only after I\u2019d spent lots\nof time with Musk that I realized the question was more for him than me.\nNothing I said would have mattered. Musk was stopping one last time and\nwondering aloud if I could be trusted and then looking into my eyes to\nmake his judgment. A split second later, we shook hands and Musk drove\noff in a red Tesla Model S sedan.\nANY STUDY OF ELON MUSK must begin at the headquarters of SpaceX,\nin Hawthorne, California\u2014a suburb of Los Angeles located a few miles\nfrom Los Angeles International Airport. It\u2019s there that visitors will find two\ngiant posters of Mars hanging side by side on the wall leading up to Musk\u2019s\ncubicle. The poster to the left depicts Mars as it is today\u2014a cold, barren red\norb. The poster on the right shows a Mars with a humongous green\nlandmass surrounded by oceans. The planet has been heated up and\ntransformed to suit humans. Musk fully intends to try and make this happen.\nTurning humans into space colonizers is his stated life\u2019s purpose. \u201cI would\nlike to die thinking that humanity has a bright future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\nsolve sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming a\nmultiplanetary species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet\n\u2014to cope with a worst-case scenario happening and extinguishing human", "consciousness\u2014then,\u201d and here he paused for a moment, \u201cI think that\nwould be really good.\u201d\nIf some of the things that Musk says and does sound absurd, that\u2019s\nbecause on one level they very much are. On this occasion, for example,\nMusk\u2019s assistant had just handed him some cookies-and-cream ice cream\nwith sprinkles on top, and he then talked earnestly about saving humanity\nwhile a blotch of the dessert hung from his lower lip.\nMusk\u2019s ready willingness to tackle impossible things has turned him\ninto a deity in Silicon Valley, where fellow CEOs like Page speak of him in\nreverential awe, and budding entrepreneurs strive \u201cto be like Elon\u201d just as\nthey had been striving in years past to mimic Steve Jobs. Silicon Valley,\nthough, operates within a warped version of reality, and outside the confines\nof its shared fantasy, Musk often comes off as a much more polarizing\nfigure. He\u2019s the guy with the electric cars, solar panels, and rockets\npeddling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P. T.\nBarnum who has gotten extraordinarily rich by preying on people\u2019s fear and\nself-hatred. Buy a Tesla. Forget about the mess you\u2019ve made of the planet\nfor a while.\nI\u2019d long been a subscriber to this latter camp. Musk had struck me as a\nwell-intentioned dreamer\u2014a card-carrying member of Silicon Valley\u2019s\ntechno-utopian club. This group tends to be a mix of Ayn Rand devotees\nand engineer absolutists who see their hyperlogical worldviews as the\nAnswer for everyone. If we\u2019d just get out of their way, they\u2019d fix all our\nproblems. One day, soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to download our brains to a\ncomputer, relax, and let their algorithms take care of everything. Much of\ntheir ambition proves inspiring and their works helpful. But the techno-\nutopians do get tiresome with their platitudes and their ability to prattle on\nfor hours without saying much of substance. More disconcerting is their\nunderlying message that humans are flawed and our humanity is an\nannoying burden that needs to be dealt with in due course. When I\u2019d caught\nMusk at Silicon Valley events, his highfalutin talk often sounded straight\nout of the techno-utopian playbook. And, most annoyingly, his world-\nsaving companies didn\u2019t even seem to be doing all that well.\nYet, in the early part of 2012, the cynics like me had to take notice of\nwhat Musk was actually accomplishing. His once-beleaguered companies\nwere succeeding at unprecedented things. SpaceX flew a supply capsule to\nthe International Space Station and brought it safely back to Earth. Tesla", "Motors delivered the Model S, a beautiful, all-electric sedan that took the\nautomotive industry\u2019s breath away and slapped Detroit sober. These two\nfeats elevated Musk to the rarest heights among business titans. Only Steve\nJobs could claim similar achievements in two such different industries,\nsometimes putting out a new Apple product and a blockbuster Pixar movie\nin the same year. And yet, Musk was not done. He was also the chairman\nand largest shareholder of SolarCity, a booming solar energy company\npoised to file for an initial public offering. Musk had somehow delivered\nthe biggest advances the space, automotive, and energy industries had seen\nin decades in what felt like one fell swoop.\nIt was in 2012 that I decided to see what Musk was like firsthand and to\nwrite a cover story about him for Bloomberg Businessweek. At this point in\nMusk\u2019s life, everything ran through his assistant/loyal appendage Mary\nBeth Brown. She invited me to visit what I\u2019ve come to refer to as Musk\nLand.\nAnyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same\nhead-scratching experience. You\u2019re told to park at One Rocket Road in\nHawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems impossible that anything\ngood could call Hawthorne home. It\u2019s a bleak part of Los Angeles County\nin which groupings of rundown houses, run-down shops, and run-down\neateries surround huge, industrial complexes that appear to have been built\nduring some kind of architectural Boring Rectangle movement. Did Elon\nMusk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck? Then, okay,\nthings start to make more sense when you see one 550,000-square-foot\nrectangle painted an ostentatious hue of \u201cUnity of Body, Soul, and Mind\u201d\nwhite. This is the main SpaceX building.\nIt was only after going through the front doors of SpaceX that the\ngrandeur of what this man had done became apparent. Musk had built an\nhonest-to-God rocket factory in the middle of Los Angeles. And this factory\nwas not making one rocket at a time. No. It was making many rockets\u2014\nfrom scratch. The factory was a giant, shared work area. Near the back were\nmassive delivery bays that allowed for the arrival of hunks of metal, which\nwere transported to two-story-high welding machines. Over to one side\nwere technicians in white coats making motherboards, radios, and other\nelectronics. Other people were in a special, airtight glass chamber, building\nthe capsules that rockets would take to the Space Station. Tattooed men in\nbandanas were blasting Van Halen and threading wires around rocket", "engines. There were completed bodies of rockets lined up one after the\nother ready to be placed on trucks. Still more rockets, in another part of the\nbuilding, awaited coats of white paint. It was difficult to take in the entire\nfactory at once. There were hundreds of bodies in constant motion whirring\naround a variety of bizarre machines.\nThis is just building number one of Musk Land. SpaceX had acquired\nseveral buildings that used to be part of a Boeing factory, which made the\nfuselages for 747s. One of these buildings has a curved roof and looks like\nan airplane hangar. It serves as the research, development, and design studio\nfor Tesla. This is where the company came up with the look for the Model S\nsedan and its follow-on, the Model X SUV. In the parking lot outside the\nstudio, Tesla has built one of its recharging stations where Los Angeles\ndrivers can top up with electricity for free. The charging center is easy\nenough to spot because Musk has installed a white and red obelisk branded\nwith the Tesla logo that sits in the middle of an infinity pool.\nIt was in my first interview with Musk, which took place at the design\nstudio, that I began to get a sense of how he talked and operated. He\u2019s a\nconfident guy, but does not always do a good job of displaying this. On\ninitial encounter, Musk can come off as shy and borderline awkward. His\nSouth African accent remains present but fading, and the charm of it is not\nenough to offset the halting nature of Musk\u2019s speech pattern. Like many an\nengineer or physicist, Musk will pause while fishing around for exact\nphrasing, and he\u2019ll often go rumbling down an esoteric, scientific rabbit\nhole without providing any helping hands or simplified explanations along\nthe way. Musk expects you to keep up. None of this is off-putting. Musk, in\nfact, will toss out plenty of jokes and can be downright charming. It\u2019s just\nthat there\u2019s a sense of purpose and pressure hanging over any conversation\nwith the man. Musk doesn\u2019t really shoot the shit. (It would end up taking\nabout thirty hours of interviews for Musk to really loosen up and let me into\na different, deeper level of his psyche and personality.)\nMost high-profile CEOs have handlers all around them. Musk mostly\nmoves about Musk Land on his own. This is not the guy who slinks into the\nrestaurant. It\u2019s the guy who owns the joint and strides about with authority.\nMusk and I talked, as he made his way around the design studio\u2019s main\nfloor, inspecting prototype parts and vehicles. At each station, employees\nrushed up to Musk and disgorged information. He listened intently,\nprocessed it, and nodded when satisfied. The people moved away and Musk", "moved to the next information dump. At one point, Tesla\u2019s design chief,\nFranz von Holzhausen, wanted Musk\u2019s take on some new tires and rims that\nhad come in for the Model S and on the seating arrangements for the Model\nX. They spoke, and then they went into a back room where executives from\na seller of high-end graphics software had prepared a presentation for Musk.\nThey wanted to show off new 3-D rendering technology that would allow\nTesla to tweak the finish of a virtual Model S and see in great detail how\nthings like shadows and streetlights played off the car\u2019s body. Tesla\u2019s\nengineers really wanted the computing systems and needed Musk\u2019s sign-off.\nThe men did their best to sell Musk on the idea while the sound of drills and\ngiant industrial fans drowned out their shtick. Musk, wearing leather shoes,\ndesigner jeans, and a black T-shirt, which is essentially his work uniform,\nhad to don 3-D goggles for the demonstration and seemed unmoved. He\ntold them he\u2019d think about it and then walked toward the source of the\nloudest noise\u2014a workshop deep in the design studio where Tesla engineers\nwere building the scaffolding for the thirty-foot decorative towers that go\noutside the charging stations. \u201cThat thing looks like it could survive a\nCategory Five hurricane,\u201d Musk said. \u201cLet\u2019s thin it up a bit.\u201d Musk and I\neventually hop into his car\u2014a black Model S\u2014and zip back to the main\nSpaceX building. \u201cI think there are probably too many smart people\npursuing Internet stuff, finance, and law,\u201d Musk said on the way. \u201cThat is\npart of the reason why we haven\u2019t seen as much innovation.\u201d\nMUSK LAND WAS A REVELATION.\nI\u2019d come to Silicon Valley in 2000 and ended up living in the Tenderloin\nneighborhood of San Francisco. It\u2019s the one part of the city that locals will\nimplore you to avoid. Without trying very hard, you can find someone\npulling down his pants and pooping in between parked cars or encounter\nsome deranged sort bashing his head into the side of a bus stop. At dive bars\nnear the local strip clubs, transvestites hit on curious businessmen and\ndrunks fall asleep on couches and soil themselves as part of their lazy\nSunday ritual. It\u2019s the gritty, knife-stabby part of San Francisco and turned\nout to be a great place to watch the dotcom dream die.\nSan Francisco has an enduring history with greed. It became a city on\nthe back of the gold rush, and not even a catastrophic earthquake could slow\nSan Francisco\u2019s economic lust for long. Don\u2019t let the granola vibes fool\nyou. Booms and busts are the rhythm of this place. And, in 2000, San", "Francisco had been overtaken by the boom of all booms and consumed by\navarice. It was a wonderful time to be alive with just about the entire\npopulace giving in to a fantasy\u2014a get-rich-quick, Internet madness. The\npulses of energy from this shared delusion were palpable, producing a\nconstant buzz that vibrated across the city. And here I was in the center of\nthe most depraved part of San Francisco, watching just how high and low\npeople get when consumed by excess.\nStories tracking the insanity of business in these times are well-known.\nYou no longer had to make something that other people wanted to buy in\norder to start a booming company. You just had to have an idea for some\nsort of Internet thing and announce it to the world in order for eager\ninvestors to fund your thought experiment. The whole goal was to make as\nmuch money as possible in the shortest amount of time because everyone\nknew on at least a subconscious level that reality had to set in eventually.\nValley denizens took very literally the clich\u00e9 of working as hard as you\nplay. People in their twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties were expected to\npull all-nighters. Cubicles were turned into temporary homes, and personal\nhygiene was abandoned. Oddly enough, making Nothing appear to be\nSomething took a lot of work. But when the time to decompress arrived,\nthere were plenty of options for total debauchery. The hot companies and\nmedia powers of the time seemed locked in a struggle to outdo each other\nwith ever-fancier parties. Old-line companies trying to look \u201cwith it\u201d would\nregularly buy space at a concert venue and then order up some dancers,\nacrobats, open bars, and the Barenaked Ladies. Young technologists would\nshow up to pound their free Jack and Cokes and snort their cocaine in porta-\npotties. Greed and self-interest were the only things that made any sense\nback then.\nWhile the good times have been well chronicled, the subsequent bad\ntimes have been\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014ignored. It\u2019s more fun to reminiscence\non irrational exuberance than the mess that gets left behind.\nLet it be said for the record, then, that the implosion of the get-rich-\nquick Internet fantasy left San Francisco and Silicon Valley in a deep\ndepression. The endless parties ended. The prostitutes no longer roamed the\nstreets of the Tenderloin at 6 A.M. offering pre-commute love. (\u201cCome on,\nhoney. It\u2019s better than coffee!\u201d) Instead of the Barenaked Ladies, you got\nthe occasional Neil Diamond tribute band at a trade show, some free T-\nshirts, and a lump of shame.", "The technology industry had no idea what to do with itself. The dumb\nventure capitalists who had been taken during the bubble didn\u2019t want to\nlook any dumber, so they stopped funding new ventures altogether.\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 big ideas were replaced by the smallest of notions. It was as\nif Silicon Valley had entered rehab en masse. It sounds melodramatic, but\nit\u2019s true. A populace of millions of clever people came to believe that they\nwere inventing the future. Then . . . poof! Playing it safe suddenly became\nthe fashionable thing to do.\nThe evidence of this malaise is in the companies and ideas formed\nduring this period. Google had appeared and really started to thrive around\n2002, but it was an outlier. Between Google and Apple\u2019s introduction of the\niPhone in 2007, there\u2019s a wasteland of ho-hum companies. And the hot new\nthings that were just starting out\u2014Facebook and Twitter\u2014certainly did not\nlook like their predecessors\u2014Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Sun Microsystems\u2014\nthat made physical products and employed tens of thousands of people in\nthe process. In the years that followed, the goal went from taking huge risks\nto create new industries and grand new ideas, to chasing easier money by\nentertaining consumers and pumping out simple apps and advertisements.\n\u201cThe best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people\nclick ads,\u201d Jeff Hammerbacher, an early Facebook engineer, told me. \u201cThat\nsucks.\u201d Silicon Valley began to look an awful lot like Hollywood.\nMeanwhile, the consumers it served had turned inward, obsessed with their\nvirtual lives.\nOne of the first people to suggest that this lull in innovation could signal\na much larger problem was Jonathan Huebner, a physicist who works at the\nPentagon\u2019s Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake, California. Huebner is\nthe Leave It to Beaver version of a merchant of death. Middle-aged, thin,\nand balding, he likes to wear a dirt-inspired ensemble of khaki pants, a\nbrown-striped shirt, and a canvas khaki jacket. He has designed weapons\nsystems since 1985, gaining direct insight into the latest and greatest\ntechnology around materials, energy, and software. Following the dot-com\nbust, he became miffed at the ho-hum nature of the supposed innovations\ncrossing his desk. In 2005, Huebner delivered a paper, \u201cA Possible\nDeclining Trend in Worldwide Innovation,\u201d which was either an indictment\nof Silicon Valley or at least an ominous warning.\nHuebner opted to use a tree metaphor to describe what he saw as the\nstate of innovation. Man has already climbed past the trunk of the tree and", "gone out on its major limbs, mining most of the really big, game-changing\nideas\u2014the wheel, electricity, the airplane, the telephone, the transistor. Now\nwe\u2019re left dangling near the end of the branches at the top of the tree and\nmostly just refining past inventions. To back up his point in the paper,\nHuebner showed that the frequency of life-changing inventions had started\nto slow. He also used data to prove that the number of patents filed per\nperson had declined over time. \u201cI think the probability of us discovering\nanother top-one-hundred-type invention gets smaller and smaller,\u201d Huebner\ntold me in an interview. \u201cInnovation is a finite resource.\u201d\nHuebner predicted that it would take people about five years to catch on\nto his thinking, and this forecast proved almost exactly right. Around 2010,\nPeter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and early Facebook investor, began\npromoting the idea that the technology industry had let people down. \u201cWe\nwanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\u201d became the tagline of his\nventure capital firm Founders Fund. In an essay called \u201cWhat Happened to\nthe Future,\u201d Thiel and his cohorts described how Twitter, its 140-character\nmessages, and similar inventions have let the public down. He argued that\nscience fiction, which once celebrated the future, has turned dystopian\nbecause people no longer have an optimistic view of technology\u2019s ability to\nchange the world.\nI\u2019d subscribed to a lot of this type of thinking until that first visit to\nMusk Land. While Musk had been anything but shy about what he was up\nto, few people outside of his companies got to see the factories, the R&D\ncenters, the machine shops, and to witness the scope of what he was doing\nfirsthand. Here was a guy who had taken much of the Silicon Valley ethic\nbehind moving quickly and running organizations free of bureaucratic\nhierarchies and applied it to improving big, fantastic machines and chasing\nthings that had the potential to be the real breakthroughs we\u2019d been missing.\nBy rights, Musk should have been part of the malaise. He jumped right\ninto dot-com mania in 1995, when, fresh out of college, he founded a\ncompany called Zip2\u2014a primitive Google Maps meets Yelp. That first\nventure ended up a big, quick hit. Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307\nmillion. Musk made $22 million from the deal and poured almost all of it\ninto his next venture, a start-up that would morph into PayPal. As the\nlargest shareholder in PayPal, Musk became fantastically well-to-do when\neBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion in 2002.", "Instead of hanging around Silicon Valley and falling into the same funk\nas his peers, however, Musk decamped to Los Angeles. The conventional\nwisdom of the time said to take a deep breath and wait for the next big thing\nto arrive in due course. Musk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million\ninto SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. Short\nof building an actual money-crushing machine, Musk could not have picked\na faster way to destroy his fortune. He became a one-man, ultra-risk-taking\nventure capital shop and doubled down on making super-complex physical\ngoods in two of the most expensive places in the world, Los Angeles and\nSilicon Valley. Whenever possible, Musk\u2019s companies would make things\nfrom scratch and try to rethink much that the aerospace, automotive, and\nsolar industries had accepted as convention.\nWith SpaceX, Musk is battling the giants of the U.S. military-industrial\ncomplex, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. He\u2019s also battling nations\n\u2014most notably Russia and China. SpaceX has made a name for itself as the\nlow-cost supplier in the industry. But that, in and of itself, is not really good\nenough to win. The space business requires dealing with a mess of politics,\nback-scratching, and protectionism that undermines the fundamentals of\ncapitalism. Steve Jobs faced similar forces when he went up against the\nrecording industry to bring the iPod and iTunes to market. The crotchety\nLuddites in the music industry were a pleasure to deal with compared to\nMusk\u2019s foes who build weapons and countries for a living. SpaceX has been\ntesting reusable rockets that can carry payloads to space and land back on\nEarth, on their launchpads, with precision. If the company can perfect this\ntechnology, it will deal a devastating blow to all of its competitors and\nalmost assuredly push some mainstays of the rocket industry out of business\nwhile establishing the United States as the world leader for taking cargo and\nhumans to space. It\u2019s a threat that Musk figures has earned him plenty of\nfierce enemies. \u201cThe list of people that would not mind if I was gone is\ngrowing,\u201d Musk said. \u201cMy family fears that the Russians will assassinate\nme.\u201d\nWith Tesla Motors, Musk has tried to revamp the way cars are\nmanufactured and sold, while building out a worldwide fuel distribution\nnetwork at the same time. Instead of hybrids, which in Musk lingo are\nsuboptimal compromises, Tesla strives to make all-electric cars that people\nlust after and that push the limits of technology. Tesla does not sell these\ncars through dealers; it sells them on the Web and in Apple-like galleries", "located in high-end shopping centers. Tesla also does not anticipate making\nlots of money from servicing its vehicles, since electric cars do not require\nthe oil changes and other maintenance procedures of traditional cars. The\ndirect sales model embraced by Tesla stands as a major affront to car\ndealers used to haggling with their customers and making their profits from\nexorbitant maintenance fees. Tesla\u2019s recharging stations now run alongside\nmany of the major highways in the United States, Europe, and Asia and can\nadd hundreds of miles of oomph back to a car in about twenty minutes.\nThese so-called supercharging stations are solar-powered, and Tesla owners\npay nothing to refuel. While much of America\u2019s infrastructure decays,\nMusk is building a futuristic end-to-end transportation system that would\nallow the United States to leapfrog the rest of the world. Musk\u2019s vision, and,\nof late, execution seem to combine the best of Henry Ford and John D.\nRockefeller.\nWith SolarCity, Musk has funded the largest installer and financer of\nsolar panels for consumers and businesses. Musk helped come up with the\nidea for SolarCity and serves as its chairman, while his cousins Lyndon and\nPeter Rive run the company. SolarCity has managed to undercut dozens of\nutilities and become a large utility in its own right. During a time in which\nclean-tech businesses have gone bankrupt with alarming regularity, Musk\nhas built two of the most successful clean-tech companies in the world. The\nMusk Co. empire of factories, tens of thousands of workers, and industrial\nmight has incumbents on the run and has turned Musk into one of the\nrichest men in the world, with a net worth around $10 billion.\nThe visit to Musk Land started to make a few things clear about how\nMusk had pulled all this off. While the \u201cputting man on Mars\u201d talk can\nstrike some people as loopy, it gave Musk a unique rallying cry for his\ncompanies. It\u2019s the sweeping goal that forms a unifying principle over\neverything he does. Employees at all three companies are well aware of this\nand well aware that they\u2019re trying to achieve the impossible day in and day\nout. When Musk sets unrealistic goals, verbally abuses employees, and\nworks them to the bone, it\u2019s understood to be\u2014on some level\u2014part of the\nMars agenda. Some employees love him for this. Others loathe him but\nremain oddly loyal out of respect for his drive and mission. What Musk has\ndeveloped that so many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley lack is a\nmeaningful worldview. He\u2019s the possessed genius on the grandest quest\nanyone has ever concocted. He\u2019s less a CEO chasing riches than a general", "marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help\nyou share baby photos, Musk wants to . . . well . . . save the human race\nfrom self-imposed or accidental annihilation.\nThe life that Musk has created to manage all of these endeavors is\npreposterous. A typical week starts at his mansion in Bel Air. On Monday,\nhe works the entire day at SpaceX. On Tuesday, he begins at SpaceX, then\nhops onto his jet and flies to Silicon Valley. He spends a couple of days\nworking at Tesla, which has its offices in Palo Alto and factory in Fremont.\nMusk does not own a home in Northern California and ends up staying at\nthe luxe Rosewood hotel or at friends\u2019 houses. To arrange the stays with\nfriends, Musk\u2019s assistant will send an e-mail asking, \u201cRoom for one?\u201d and if\nthe friend says, \u201cYes,\u201d Musk turns up at the door late at night. Most often he\nstays in a guest room, but he\u2019s also been known to crash on the couch after\nwinding down with some video games. Then it\u2019s back to Los Angeles and\nSpaceX on Thursday. He shares custody of his five young boys\u2014twins and\ntriplets\u2014with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them four days a week. Each\nyear, Musk tabulates the amount of flight time he endures per week to help\nhim get a sense of just how out of hand things are getting. Asked how he\nsurvives this schedule, Musk said, \u201cI had a tough childhood, so maybe that\nwas helpful.\u201d\nDuring one visit to Musk Land, he had to squeeze our interview in\nbefore heading off for a camping trip at Crater Lake National Park in\nOregon. It was almost 8 P.M. on a Friday, so Musk would soon be piling his\nboys and nannies into his private jet and then meeting drivers who would\ntake him to his friends at the campsite; the friends would then help the\nMusk clan unpack and complete their pitch-black arrival. There would be a\nbit of hiking over the weekend. Then the relaxation would end. Musk would\nfly with the boys back to Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. Then, he would\ntake off on his own that evening for New York. Sleep. Hit the morning talk\nshows on Monday. Meetings. E-mail. Sleep. Fly back to Los Angeles\nTuesday morning. Work at SpaceX. Fly to San Jose Tuesday afternoon to\nvisit the Tesla Motors factory. Fly to Washington, D.C., that night and see\nPresident Obama. Fly back to Los Angeles Wednesday night. Spend a\ncouple of days working at SpaceX. Then go to a weekend conference held\nby Google\u2019s chairman, Eric Schmidt, in Yellowstone. At this time, Musk\nhad just split from his second wife, the actress Talulah Riley, and was trying\nto calculate if he could mix a personal life into all of this. \u201cI think the time", "allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI would\nlike to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend.\nThat\u2019s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even\nanother five to ten\u2014how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe\nten hours? That\u2019s kind of the minimum? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMusk rarely finds time to decompress, but when he does, the festivities\nare just as dramatic as the rest of his life. On his thirtieth birthday, Musk\nrented out a castle in England for about twenty people. From 2 A.M. until 6\nA.M., they played a variation of hide-and-seek called sardines in which one\nperson runs off and hides and everyone else looks for him. Another party\noccurred in Paris. Musk, his brother, and cousins found themselves awake\nat midnight and decided to bicycle through the city until 6 A.M. They slept\nall day and then boarded the Orient Express in the evening. Once again,\nthey stayed up all night. The Lucent Dossier Experience\u2014an avant-garde\ngroup of performers\u2014were on the luxurious train, performing palm\nreadings and acrobatics. When the train arrived in Venice the next day,\nMusk\u2019s family had dinner and then hung out on the patio of their hotel\noverlooking the Grand Canal until 9 A.M. Musk loves costume parties as\nwell, and turned up at one dressed like a knight and using a parasol to duel a\nmidget wearing a Darth Vader costume.\nFor one of his most recent birthdays, Musk invited fifty people to a\ncastle\u2014or at least the United States\u2019 best approximation of a castle\u2014in\nTarrytown, New York. This party had a Japanese steampunk theme, which\nis sort of like a sci-fi lover\u2019s wet dream\u2014a mix of corsets, leather, and\nmachine worship. Musk dressed as a samurai.\nThe festivities included a performance of The Mikado, a Victorian\ncomic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan set in Japan, at a small theater in the\nheart of town. \u201cI am not sure the Americans got it,\u201d said Riley, whom Musk\nremarried after his ten-hour-a-week dating plan failed. The Americans and\neveryone else did enjoy what followed. Back at the castle, Musk donned a\nblindfold, got pushed up against a wall, and held balloons in each hand and\nanother between his legs. The knife thrower then went to work. \u201cI\u2019d seen\nhim before, but did worry that maybe he could have an off day,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cStill, I thought, he would maybe hit one gonad but not both.\u201d The\nonlookers were stunned and frightened for Musk\u2019s safety. \u201cThat was\nbizarre,\u201d said Bill Lee, a technology investor and one of Musk\u2019s good\nfriends. \u201cBut Elon believes in the science of things.\u201d One of the world\u2019s top", "sumo wrestlers showed up at the party along with some of his compatriots.\nA ring had been set up at the castle, and Musk faced off against the\nchampion. \u201cHe was three hundred and fifty pounds, and they were not\njiggly pounds,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI went full adrenaline rush and managed to lift\nthe guy off the ground. He let me win that first round and then beat me. I\nthink my back is still screwed up.\u201d\nRiley turned planning these types of parties for Musk into an art. She\nmet Musk back in 2008, when his companies were collapsing. She watched\nhim lose his entire fortune and get ridiculed by the press. She knows that\nthe sting of these years remains and has combined with the other traumas in\nMusk\u2019s life\u2014the tragic loss of an infant son and a brutal upbringing in\nSouth Africa\u2014to create a tortured soul. Riley has gone to great lengths to\nmake sure Musk\u2019s escapes from work and this past leave him feeling\nrefreshed if not healed. \u201cI try to think of fun things he has not done before\nwhere he can relax,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for his miserable\nchildhood now.\u201d\nGenuine as Riley\u2019s efforts might have been, they were not entirely\neffective. Not long after the Sumo party, I found Musk back at work at the\nTesla headquarters in Palo Alto. It was a Saturday, and the parking lot was\nfull of cars. Inside of the Tesla offices, hundreds of young men were at\nwork\u2014some of them designing car parts on computers and others\nconducting experiments with electronics equipment on their desks. Musk\u2019s\nuproarious laugh would erupt every few minutes and carry through the\nentire floor. When Musk came into the meeting room where I\u2019d been\nwaiting, I noted how impressive it was for so many people to turn up on a\nSaturday. Musk saw the situation in a different light, complaining that fewer\nand fewer people had been working weekends of late. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown\nfucking soft,\u201d Musk replied. \u201cI was just going to send out an e-mail. We\u2019re\nfucking soft.\u201d (A word of warning: There\u2019s going to be a lot of \u201cfuck\u201d in\nthis book. Musk adores the word, and so do most of the people in his inner\ncircle.)\nThis kind of declaration seems to fit with our impressions of other\nvisionaries. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Howard Hughes or Steve Jobs\nchastising their workforce in a similar way. Building things\u2014especially big\nthings\u2014is a messy business. In the two decades Musk has spent creating\ncompanies, he\u2019s left behind a trail of people who either adore or despise\nhim. During the course of my reporting, these people lined up to give me", "their take on Musk and the gory details of how he and his businesses\noperate.\nMy dinners with Musk and periodic trips to Musk Land revealed a\ndifferent set of possible truths about the man. He\u2019s set about building\nsomething that has the potential to be much grander than anything Hughes\nor Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive\nthat America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new\nand fantastic. At the heart of this transformation are Musk\u2019s skills as a\nsoftware maker and his ability to apply them to machines. He\u2019s merged\natoms and bits in ways that few people thought possible, and the results\nhave been spectacular. It\u2019s true enough that Musk has yet to have a\nconsumer hit on the order of the iPhone or to touch more than one billion\npeople like Facebook. For the moment, he\u2019s still making rich people\u2019s toys,\nand his budding empire could be an exploded rocket or massive Tesla recall\naway from collapse. On the other hand, Musk\u2019s companies have already\naccomplished far more than his loudest detractors thought possible, and the\npromise of what\u2019s to come has to leave hardened types feeling optimistic\nduring their weaker moments. \u201cTo me, Elon is the shining example of how\nSilicon Valley might be able to reinvent itself and be more relevant than\nchasing these quick IPOs and focusing on getting incremental products\nout,\u201d said Edward Jung, a famed software engineer and inventor. \u201cThose\nthings are important, but they are not enough. We need to look at different\nmodels of how to do things that are longer term in nature and where the\ntechnology is more integrated.\u201d The integration mentioned by Jung\u2014the\nharmonious melding of software, electronics, advanced materials, and\ncomputing horsepower\u2014appears to be Musk\u2019s gift. Squint ever so slightly,\nand it looks like Musk could be using his skills to pave the way toward an\nage of astonishing machines and science fiction dreams made manifest.\nIn that sense, Musk comes off much more like Thomas Edison than\nHoward Hughes. He\u2019s an inventor, celebrity businessman, and industrialist\nable to take big ideas and turn them into big products. He\u2019s employing\nthousands of people to forge metal in American factories at a time when this\nwas thought to be impossible. Born in South Africa, Musk now looks like\nAmerica\u2019s most innovative industrialist and outlandish thinker and the\nperson most likely to set Silicon Valley on a more ambitious course.\nBecause of Musk, Americans could wake up in ten years with the most\nmodern highway in the world: a transit system run by thousands of solar-", "powered charging stations and traversed by electric cars. By that time,\nSpaceX may well be sending up rockets every day, taking people and things\nto dozens of habitats and making preparations for longer treks to Mars.\nThese advances are simultaneously difficult to fathom and seemingly\ninevitable if Musk can simply buy enough time to make them work. As his\nex-wife, Justine, put it, \u201cHe does what he wants, and he is relentless about\nit. It\u2019s Elon\u2019s world, and the rest of us live in it.\u201d", "2", "AFRICA\nT\nHE PUBLIC FIRST MET ELON REEVE MUSK IN 1984. The South\nAfrican trade publication PC and Office Technology published the source\ncode to a video game Musk had designed. Called Blastar, the science-\nfiction-inspired space game required 167 lines of instructions to run. This\nwas back in the day when early computer users were required to type out\ncommands to make their machines do much of anything. In that context,\nMusk\u2019s game did not shine as a marvel of computer science but it certainly\nsurpassed what most twelve-year-olds were kicking out at the time. Its\ncoverage in the magazine netted Musk five hundred dollars and provided\nsome early hints about his character. The Blastar spread on page 69 of the\nmagazine shows that the young man wanted to go by the sci-fi-author-\nsounding name E. R. Musk and that he already had visions of grand\nconquests dancing in his head. The brief explainer states, \u201cIn this game you\nhave to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen\nBombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes good use of sprites\nand animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.\u201d (As of\nthis writing, not even the Internet knows what \u201cstatus beam machines\u201d are.)\nA boy fantasizing about space and battles between good and evil is\nanything but amazing. A boy who takes these fantasies seriously is more\nremarkable. Such was the case with the young Elon Musk. By the middle of\nhis teenage years, Musk had blended fantasy and reality to the point that\nthey were hard to separate in his mind. Musk came to see man\u2019s fate in the\nuniverse as a personal obligation. If that meant pursuing cleaner energy\ntechnology or building spaceships to extend the human species\u2019s reach, then\nso be it. Musk would find a way to make these things happen. \u201cMaybe I\nread too many comics as a kid,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIn the comics, it always seems\nlike they are trying to save the world. It seemed like one should try to make\nthe world a better place because the inverse makes no sense.\u201d\nAt around age fourteen, Musk had a full-on existential crisis. He tried to\ndeal with it like many gifted adolescents do, turning to religious and", "philosophical texts. Musk sampled a handful of ideologies and then ended\nup more or less back where he had started, embracing the sci-fi lessons\nfound in one of the most influential books in his life: The Hitchhiker\u2019s\nGuide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. \u201cHe points out that one of the\nreally tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,\u201d Musk said. \u201cOnce\nyou figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the\nconclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of\nhuman consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.\u201d\nThe teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. \u201cThe\nonly thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective\nenlightenment,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s easy enough to spot some of the underpinnings of Musk\u2019s search for\npurpose. Born in 1971, he grew up in Pretoria, a large city in the\nnortheastern part of South Africa, just an hour\u2019s drive from Johannesburg.\nThe specter of apartheid was present throughout his childhood, as South\nAfrica frequently boiled over with tension and violence. Blacks and whites\nclashed, as did blacks of different tribes. Musk turned four years old just\ndays after the Soweto Uprising, in which hundreds of black students died\nwhile protesting decrees of the white government. For years South Africa\nfaced sanctions imposed by other nations due to its racist policies. Musk\nhad the luxury of traveling abroad during his childhood and would have\ngotten a flavor for how outsiders viewed South Africa.\nBut what had even more of an impact on Musk\u2019s personality was the\nwhite Afrikaner culture so prevalent in Pretoria and the surrounding areas.\nHypermasculine behavior was celebrated and tough jocks were revered.\nWhile Musk enjoyed a level of privilege, he lived as an outsider whose\nreserved personality and geeky inclinations ran against the prevailing\nattitudes of the time. His notion that something about the world had gone\nawry received constant reinforcement, and Musk, almost from his earliest\ndays, plotted an escape from his surroundings and dreamed of a place that\nwould allow his personality and dreams to flourish. He saw America in its\nmost clich\u00e9d form, as the land of opportunity and the most likely stage for\nmaking the realization of his dreams possible. This is how it came to pass\nthat a lonesome, gawky South African boy who talked with the utmost\nsincerity about pursuing \u201ccollective enlightenment\u201d ended up as America\u2019s\nmost adventurous industrialist.", "When Musk did finally reach the United States in his twenties, it\nmarked a return to his ancestral roots. Family trees suggest that ancestors\nbearing the Swiss German surname of Haldeman on the maternal side of\nMusk\u2019s family left Europe for New York during the Revolutionary War.\nFrom New York, they spread out to the prairies of the Midwest\u2014Illinois\nand Minnesota, in particular. \u201cWe had people that fought on both sides of\nthe Civil War apparently and were a family of farmers,\u201d said Scott\nHaldeman, Musk\u2019s uncle and the unofficial family historian.\nThroughout his childhood, boys teased Musk because of his unusual\nname. He earned the first part of it from his great-grandfather John Elon\nHaldeman, who was born in 18721 and grew up in Illinois before heading to\nMinnesota. There he would meet his wife, Almeda Jane Norman, who was\nfive years younger. By 1902, the couple had settled down in a log cabin in\nthe central Minnesota town of Pequot and given birth to their son Joshua\nNorman Haldeman, Musk\u2019s grandfather. He would grow up to become an\neccentric and exceptional man and a model for Musk.*\nJoshua Norman Haldeman is described as an athletic, self-reliant boy. In\n1907, his family moved to the prairies of Saskatchewan, and his father died\nshortly thereafter when Joshua was just seven, leaving the boy to help run\nthe house. He took to the wide-open land and picked up bronco horseback\nriding, boxing, and wrestling. Haldeman would break in horses for local\nfarmers, often hurting himself in the process, and he organized one of\nCanada\u2019s first rodeos. Family pictures show Joshua dressed in a decorative\npair of chaps demonstrating his rope-spinning skills. As a teenager,\nHaldeman left home to get a degree from the Palmer School of Chiropractic\nin Iowa and then returned to Saskatchewan to become a farmer.\nWhen the depression hit in the 1930s, Haldeman fell into a financial\ncrisis. He could not afford to keep up with bank loans on his equipment and\nhad five thousand acres of land seized. \u201cFrom then on, Dad didn\u2019t believe in\nbanks or holding on to money,\u201d said Scott Haldeman, who would go on to\nreceive his chiropractic degree from the same school as his father and\nbecome one of the world\u2019s top spinal pain experts. After losing the farm\naround 1934, Haldeman lived something of a nomadic existence that his\ngrandson would replicate in Canada decades later. Standing six feet, three\ninches, he did odd jobs as a construction worker and rodeo performer before\nsettling down as a chiropractor.*", "By 1948, Haldeman had married a Canadian dance studio instructor,\nWinnifred Josephine Fletcher, or Wyn, and built a booming chiropractic\npractice. That year, the family, which already included a son and a daughter,\nwelcomed twin daughters Kaye and Maye, Musk\u2019s mother. The children\nlived in a three-story, twenty-room house that included a dance studio to let\nWyn keep teaching students. Ever in search of something new to do,\nHaldeman had picked up flying and bought his own plane. The family\ngained some measure of notoriety as people heard about Haldeman and his\nwife packing their kids into the back of the single-engine craft and heading\noff on excursions all around North America. Haldeman would often show\nup at political and chiropractic meetings in the plane and later wrote a book\nwith his wife called The Flying Haldemans: Pity the Poor Private Pilot.\nHaldeman seemed to have everything going for him when, in 1950, he\ndecided to give it all away. The doctor-cum-politician had long railed\nagainst government interference in the lives of individuals and had come to\nsee the Canadian bureaucracy as too meddlesome. A man who forbade\nswearing, smoking, Coca-Cola, and refined flour at his house, Haldeman\ncontended that the moral character of Canada had started to decline.\nHaldeman also possessed an enduring lust for adventure. And so, over the\ncourse of a few months, the family sold their house and dance and\nchiropractic practices and decided to move to South Africa\u2014a place\nHaldeman had never been. Scott Haldeman remembers helping his father\ndisassemble the family\u2019s Bellanca Cruisair (1948) airplane and put it into\ncrates before shipping it to Africa. Once in South Africa, the family rebuilt\nthe plane and used it to scour the country for a nice place to live, ultimately\nsettling on Pretoria, where Haldeman set up a new chiropractic practice.\nThe family\u2019s spirit for adventure seemed to know no bounds. In 1952,\nJoshua and Wyn made a 22,000-mile round-trip journey in their plane,\nflying up through Africa to Scotland and Norway. Wyn served as the\nnavigator and, though not a licensed pilot, would sometimes take over the\nflying duties. The couple topped this effort in 1954, flying 30,000 miles to\nAustralia and back. Newspapers reported on the couple\u2019s trip, and they\u2019re\nbelieved to be the only private pilots to get from Africa to Australia in a\nsingle-engine plane.*\nWhen not up in the air, the Haldemans were out in the bush going on\ngreat, monthlong expeditions to find the Lost City of the Kalahari Desert, a\nsupposed abandoned city in southern Africa. A family photo from one of", "these excursions shows the five children in the middle of the African bush.\nThey have gathered around a large metal pot being warmed by the embers\nof a campfire. The children look relaxed as they sit in folding chairs, legs\ncrossed and reading books. Behind them is the ruby-red Bellanca plane, a\ntent, and a car. The tranquility of the scene belies how dangerous these trips\nwere. During one incident, the family\u2019s truck hit a tree stump and forced the\nbumper through the radiator. Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means\nof communication, Joshua worked for three days to fix the truck, while the\nfamily hunted for food. At other times, hyenas and leopards would circle\nthe campfire at night, and, one morning, the family woke to find a lion three\nfeet away from their main table. Joshua grabbed the first object he could\nfind\u2014a lamp\u2014waved it, and told the lion to go away. And it did.*\nThe Haldemans had a laissez-faire approach to raising their children,\nwhich would extend over the generations to Musk. Their kids were never\npunished, as Joshua believed they would intuit their way to proper behavior.\nWhen mom and dad went off on their tremendous flights, the kids were left\nat home. Scott Haldeman can\u2019t remember his father setting foot at his\nschool a single time even though his son was captain of the rugby team and\na prefect. \u201cTo him, that was all just anticipated,\u201d said Scott Haldeman. \u201cWe\nwere left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just\nhave to make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very\nproud of Elon.\u201d\nHaldeman died in 1974 at the age of seventy-two. He\u2019d been doing\npractice landings in his plane and didn\u2019t see a wire attached to a pair of\npoles. The wire caught the plane\u2019s wheels and flipped the craft, and\nHaldeman broke his neck. Elon was a toddler at the time. But throughout\nhis childhood, Elon heard many stories about his grandfather\u2019s exploits and\nsat through countless slide shows that documented his travels and trips\nthrough the bush. \u201cMy grandmother told these tales of how they almost died\nseveral times along their journeys,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThey were flying in a plane\nwith literally no instruments\u2014not even a radio, and they had road maps\ninstead of aerial maps, and some of those weren\u2019t even correct. My\ngrandfather had this desire for adventure, exploration doing crazy things.\u201d\nElon buys into the idea that his unusual tolerance for risk may well have\nbeen inherited directly from his grandfather. Many years after the last slide\nshow, Elon tried to find and purchase the red Bellanca plane but could not\nlocate it.", "Maye Musk, Elon\u2019s mother, grew up idolizing her parents. In her youth,\nshe was considered a nerd. She liked math and science and did well at the\ncoursework. By the age of fifteen, however, people had taken notice of\nsome of her other attributes. Maye was gorgeous. Tall with ash-blond hair,\nMaye had the high cheekbones and angular features that would make her\nstand out anywhere. A friend of the family ran a modeling school, and\nMaye took some courses. On the weekends, she did runway shows,\nmagazine shoots, occasionally showed up at a senator\u2019s or ambassador\u2019s\nhome for an event, and ended up as a finalist for Miss South Africa. (Maye\nhas continued to model into her sixties, appearing on the covers of\nmagazines like New York and Elle and in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s music videos.)\nMaye and Elon\u2019s father, Errol Musk, grew up in the same neighborhood.\nThey met for the first time when Maye, born in 1948, was about eleven.\nErrol was the cool kid to Maye\u2019s nerd but had a crush on her for years. \u201cHe\nfell in love with me because of my legs and my teeth,\u201d said Maye. The two\nwould date on and off throughout their time at university. And, according to\nMaye, Errol spent about seven years as a relentless suitor seeking her hand\nin marriage and eventually breaking her will. \u201cHe just never stopped\nproposing,\u201d she said.\nTheir marriage was complicated from the start. Maye became pregnant\nduring the couple\u2019s honeymoon and gave birth to Elon on June 28, 1971,\nnine months and two days after her wedding day. While they may not have\nenjoyed marital bliss, the couple carved out a decent life for themselves in\nPretoria. Errol worked as a mechanical and electrical engineer and handled\nlarge projects such as office buildings, retail complexes, residential\nsubdivisions, and an air force base, while Maye set up a practice as a\ndietician. A bit more than a year after Elon\u2019s birth came his brother Kimbal,\nand soon thereafter came their sister Tosca.\nElon exhibited all the traits of a curious, energetic tot. He picked things\nup easily, and Maye, like many mothers do, pegged her son as brilliant and\nprecocious. \u201cHe seemed to understand things quicker than the other kids,\u201d\nshe said. The perplexing thing was that Elon seemed to drift off into a\ntrance at times. People spoke to him, but nothing got through when he had a\ncertain, distant look in his eyes. This happened so often that Elon\u2019s parents\nand doctors thought he might be deaf. \u201cSometimes, he just didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d\nsaid Maye. Doctors ran a series of tests on Elon, and elected to remove his\nadenoid glands, which can improve hearing in children. \u201cWell, it didn\u2019t", "change,\u201d said Maye. Elon\u2019s condition had far more to do with the wiring of\nhis mind than how his auditory system functioned. \u201cHe goes into his brain,\nand then you just see he is in another world,\u201d Maye said. \u201cHe still does that.\nNow I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or\nsomething.\u201d\nOther children did not respond well to these dreamlike states. You could\ndo jumping jacks right beside Musk or yell at him, and he would not even\nnotice. He kept right on thinking, and those around him judged that he was\neither rude or really weird. \u201cI do think Elon was always a little different but\nin a nerdy way,\u201d Maye said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t endear him to his peers.\u201d\nFor Musk, these pensive moments were wonderful. At five and six, he\nhad found a way to block out the world and dedicate all of his concentration\nto a single task. Part of this ability stemmed from the very visual way in\nwhich Musk\u2019s mind worked. He could see images in his mind\u2019s eye with a\nclarity and detail that we might associate today with an engineering drawing\nproduced by computer software. \u201cIt seems as though the part of the brain\nthat\u2019s usually reserved for visual processing\u2014the part that is used to\nprocess images coming in from my eyes\u2014gets taken over by internal\nthought processes,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this as much now because there\nare so many things demanding my attention but, as a kid, it happened a lot.\nThat large part of your brain that\u2019s used to handle incoming images gets\nused for internal thinking.\u201d Computers split their hardest jobs between two\ntypes of chips. There are graphics chips that deal with processing the\nimages produced by a television show stream or video game and\ncomputational chips that handle general purpose tasks and mathematical\noperations. Over time, Musk has ended up thinking that his brain has the\nequivalent of a graphics chip. It allows him to see things out in the world,\nreplicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might change or behave\nwhen interacting with other objects. \u201cFor images and numbers, I can\nprocess their interrelationships and algorithmic relationships,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cAcceleration, momentum, kinetic energy\u2014how those sorts of things will\nbe affected by objects comes through very vividly.\u201d\nThe most striking part of Elon\u2019s character as a young boy was his\ncompulsion to read. From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in\nhis hands at all times. \u201cIt was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day,\u201d\nsaid Kimbal. \u201cIf it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a\nday.\u201d The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they", "realized mid-trip that Elon had gone missing. Maye or Kimbal would pop\ninto the nearest bookstore and find Elon somewhere near the back sitting on\nthe floor and reading in one of his trancelike states.\nAs Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school\nended at 2 P.M. and stay there until about 6 P.M., when his parents returned\nhome from work. He plowed through fiction books and then comics and\nthen nonfiction titles. \u201cSometimes they kicked me out of the store, but\nusually not,\u201d Elon said. He listed The Lord of the Rings, Isaac Asimov\u2019s\nFoundation series, and Robert Heinlein\u2019s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress as\nsome of his favorites, alongside The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. \u201cAt\none point, I ran out of books to read at the school library and the\nneighborhood library,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThis is maybe the third or fourth grade.\nI tried to convince the librarian to order books for me. So then, I started to\nread the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was so helpful. You don\u2019t know\nwhat you don\u2019t know. You realize there are all these things out there.\u201d\nElon, in fact, churned through two sets of encyclopedias\u2014a feat that did\nlittle to help him make friends. The boy had a photographic memory, and\nthe encyclopedias turned him into a fact factory. He came off as a classic\nknow-it-all. At the dinner table, Tosca would wonder aloud about the\ndistance from Earth to the Moon. Elon would spit out the exact\nmeasurement at perigee and apogee. \u201cIf we had a question, Tosca would\nalways say, \u2018Just ask genius boy,\u2019\u201d Maye said. \u201cWe could ask him about\nanything. He just remembered it.\u201d Elon cemented his bookworm reputation\nthrough his clumsy ways. \u201cHe\u2019s not very sporty,\u201d said Maye.\nMaye tells the story of Elon playing outside one night with his siblings\nand cousins. When one of them complained of being frightened by the dark,\nElon pointed out that \u201cdark is merely the absence of light,\u201d which did little\nto reassure the scared child. As a youngster, Elon\u2019s constant yearning to\ncorrect people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his\nfeelings of isolation. Elon genuinely thought that people would be happy to\nhear about the flaws in their thinking. \u201cKids don\u2019t like answers like that,\u201d\nsaid Maye. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Elon, we are not playing with you anymore.\u2019\nI felt very sad as a mother because I think he wanted friends. Kimbal and\nTosca would bring home friends, and Elon wouldn\u2019t, and he would want to\nplay with them. But he was awkward, you know.\u201d Maye urged Kimbal and\nTosca to include Elon. They responded as kids will. \u201cBut Mom, he\u2019s not\nfun.\u201d As he got older, however, Elon would have strong, affectionate", "attachments to his siblings and cousins\u2014his mother\u2019s sister\u2019s sons. Though\nhe kept to himself at school, Elon had an outgoing nature with members of\nhis family and eventually took on the role of elder and chief instigator\namong them.\nFor a while, life inside the Musk household was quite good. The family\nowned one of the biggest houses in Pretoria thanks to the success of Errol\u2019s\nengineering business. There\u2019s a portrait of the three Musk children taken\nwhen Elon was about eight years old that shows three blond, fit children\nsitting next to each other on a brick porch with Pretoria\u2019s famous purple\njacaranda trees in the background. Elon has large, rounded cheeks and a\nbroad smile.\nThen, not long after the photo was taken, the family fell apart. His\nparents separated and divorced within the year. Maye moved with the kids\nto the family\u2019s holiday home in Durban, on South Africa\u2019s eastern coast.\nAfter a couple of years of this arrangement, Elon decided he wanted to live\nwith his father. \u201cMy father seemed sort of sad and lonely, and my mom had\nthree kids, and he didn\u2019t have any,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt seemed unfair.\u201d Some\nmembers of Musk\u2019s family have bought into this idea that Elon\u2019s logical\nnature propelled him, while others claim that his father\u2019s mother, Cora,\nexerted a lot of pressure on the boy. \u201cI could not understand why he would\nleave this happy home I made for him\u2014this really happy home,\u201d said\nMaye. \u201cBut Elon is his own person.\u201d Justine Musk, Elon\u2019s ex-wife and the\nmother of his five boys, theorized that Elon identified more with the alpha\nmale of the house and wasn\u2019t bothered by the emotional aspect of the\ndecision. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was particularly close with either parent,\u201d Justine\nsaid, while describing the Musk clan overall as being cool and the opposite\nof doting. Kimbal later opted to live with Errol as well, saying simply that\nby nature a son wants to live with his father.\nWhenever the topic of Errol arrives, members of Elon\u2019s family clam up.\nThey\u2019re in agreement that he is not a pleasant man to be around but have\ndeclined to elaborate. Errol has since been remarried, and Elon has two,\nyounger half sisters of whom he\u2019s quite protective. Elon and his siblings\nseem determined not to bad-mouth Errol publicly, so as not to upset the\nsisters.\nThe basics are as follows: Errol\u2019s side of the family has deep South\nAfrican roots. The Musk clan can trace its presence in the country back\nabout two hundred years and claim an entry in Pretoria\u2019s first phone book.", "Errol\u2019s father, Walter Henry James Musk, was an army sergeant. \u201cI\nremember him almost never talking,\u201d Elon said. \u201cHe would just drink\nwhiskey and be grumpy and was very good at doing crossword puzzles.\u201d\nCora Amelia Musk, Errol\u2019s mother, was born in England to a family famed\nfor its intellectual genes. She embraced both the spotlight and her\ngrandchildren. \u201cOur grandmother had this very dominant personality and\nwas quite an enterprising woman,\u201d said Kimbal. \u201cShe was a very big\ninfluence in our lives.\u201d Elon considered his relationship with Cora\u2014or\nNana, as he called her\u2014particularly tight. \u201cAfter the divorce, she took care\nof me quite a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would pick me up from school, and I would\nhang out with her playing Scrabble and that type of thing.\u201d\nOn the surface, life at Errol\u2019s house seemed grand. He had plenty of\nbooks for Elon to read from cover to cover and money to buy a computer\nand other objects that Elon desired. Errol took his children on numerous\ntrips overseas. \u201cIt was an amazingly fun time,\u201d said Kimbal. \u201cI have a lot of\nfun memories from that.\u201d Errol also impressed the kids with his intellect\nand dealt out some practical lessons. \u201cHe was a talented engineer,\u201d Elon\nsaid. \u201cHe knew how every physical object worked.\u201d Both Elon and Kimbal\nwere required to go to the sites of Errol\u2019s engineering jobs and learn how to\nlay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, and put in electrical wiring.\n\u201cThere were fun moments,\u201d Elon said.\nErrol was what Kimbal described as \u201cultra-present and very intense.\u201d\nHe would sit Elon and Kimbal down and lecture at them for three to four\nhours without the boys being able to respond. He seemed to delight in being\nhard on the boys and sucked the fun out of common childhood diversions.\nFrom time to time, Elon tried to convince his dad to move to America and\noften talked about his intentions to live in the United States later in life.\nErrol countered such dreams by trying to teach Elon a lesson. He sent the\nhousekeepers away and had Elon do all the chores to let him know what it\nwas like \u201cto play American.\u201d\nWhile Elon and Kimbal declined to provide an exact recounting, they\nclearly experienced something awful and profound during those years with\ntheir father. They both talk about having to endure some form of\npsychological torture. \u201cHe definitely has serious chemical stuff,\u201d said\nKimbal. \u201cWhich I am sure Elon and I have inherited. It was a very\nemotionally challenging upbringing, but it made us who we are today.\u201d\nMaye bristled when the subject of Errol came up. \u201cNobody gets along with", "him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not nice to anyone. I don\u2019t want to tell stories because\nthey are horrendous. You know, you just don\u2019t talk about it. There are kids\nand grandkids involved.\u201d\nWhen asked to chat about Elon, Errol responded via e-mail: \u201cElon was a\nvery independent and focused child at home with me. He loved computer\nscience before anyone even knew what it was in South Africa and his\nability was widely recognized by the time he was 12 years old. Elon and his\nbrother Kimbal\u2019s activities as children and young men were so many and\nvaried that it\u2019s difficult to name just one, as they travelled together with me\nextensively in S. Africa and the world at large, visiting all the continents\nregularly from the age of six onwards. Elon and his brother and sister were\nand continue to be exemplary, in every way a father could want. I\u2019m very\nproud of what Elon\u2019s accomplished.\u201d\nErrol copied Elon on this e-mail, and Elon warned me off corresponding\nwith his father, insisting that his father\u2019s take on past events could not be\ntrusted. \u201cHe is an odd duck,\u201d Musk said. But, when pressed for more\ninformation, Musk dodged. \u201cIt would certainly be accurate to say that I did\nnot have a good childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may sound good. It was not absent\nof good, but it was not a happy childhood. It was like misery. He\u2019s good at\nmaking life miserable\u2014that\u2019s for sure. He can take any situation no matter\nhow good it is and make it bad. He\u2019s not a happy man. I don\u2019t know . . .\nfuck . . . I don\u2019t know how someone becomes like he is. It would just cause\ntoo much trouble to tell you any more.\u201d Elon and Justine have vowed that\ntheir children will not be allowed to meet Errol.\nWhen Elon was nearly ten years old, he saw a computer for the first\ntime, at the Sandton City Mall in Johannesburg. \u201cThere was an electronics\nstore that mostly did hi-fi-type stuff, but then, in one corner, they started\nstocking a few computers,\u201d Musk said. He felt awed right away\u2014\u201cIt was\nlike, \u2018Whoa. Holy shit!\u2019\u201d\u2014by this machine that could be programmed to do\na person\u2019s bidding. \u201cI had to have that and then hounded my father to get\nthe computer,\u201d Musk said. Soon he owned a Commodore VIC-20, a popular\nhome machine that went on sale in 1980. Elon\u2019s computer arrived with five\nkilobytes of memory and a workbook on the BASIC programming\nlanguage. \u201cIt was supposed to take like six months to get through all the\nlessons,\u201d Elon said. \u201cI just got super OCD on it and stayed up for three days\nwith no sleep and did the entire thing. It seemed like the most super-\ncompelling thing I had ever seen.\u201d Despite being an engineer, Musk\u2019s father", "was something of a Luddite and dismissive of the machine. Elon recounted\nthat \u201che said it was just for games and that you\u2019d never be able to do real\nengineering on it. I just said, \u2018Whatever.\u2019\u201d\nWhile bookish and into his new computer, Elon quite often led Kimbal\nand his cousins (Kaye\u2019s children) Russ, Lyndon, and Peter Rive on\nadventures. They dabbled one year in selling Easter eggs door-to-door in\nthe neighborhood. The eggs were not well decorated, but the boys still\nmarked them up a few hundred percent for their wealthy neighbors. Elon\nalso spearheaded their work with homemade explosives and rockets. South\nAfrica did not have the Estes rocket kits popular among hobbyists, so Elon\nwould create his own chemical compounds and put them inside of canisters.\n\u201cIt is remarkable how many things you can get to explode,\u201d Elon said.\n\u201cSaltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal are the basic ingredients for gunpowder, and\nthen if you combine a strong acid with a strong alkaline, that will generally\nrelease a lot of energy. Granulated chlorine with brake fluid\u2014that\u2019s quite\nimpressive. I\u2019m lucky I have all my fingers.\u201d When not handling\nexplosives, the boys put on layers of clothing and goggles and shot each\nother with pellet guns. Elon and Kimbal raced dirt bikes against each other\nin sandlots until Kimbal flew off his bike one day and hurtled into a barbed\nwire fence.\nAs the years went on, the cousins took their entrepreneurial pursuits\nmore seriously, even attempting at one point to start a video arcade. Without\nany parents knowing, the boys picked out a spot for their arcade, got a\nlease, and started navigating the permit process for their business.\nEventually, they had to get someone over eighteen to sign a legal document,\nand neither the Rives\u2019 father nor Errol would oblige. It would take a couple\nof decades, but Elon and the Rives would eventually go into business\ntogether.\nThe boys\u2019 most audacious exploits may have been their trips between\nPretoria and Johannesburg. During the 1980s, South Africa could be a\nterribly violent place, and the thirty-five-mile train trip linking Pretoria and\nJohannesburg stood out as one of the world\u2019s more dangerous rides. Kimbal\ncounted the train journeys as formative experiences for him and Elon.\n\u201cSouth Africa was not a happy-go-lucky place, and that has an impact on\nyou. We saw some really rough stuff. It was part of an atypical upbringing\n\u2014just this insane set of experiences that changes how you view risk. You", "don\u2019t grow up thinking getting a job is the hard part. That\u2019s not interesting\nenough.\u201d\nThe boys ranged in age from about thirteen to sixteen and chased a mix\nof parties and geeky exploits in Johannesburg. During one jaunt, they went\nto a Dungeons & Dragons tournament. \u201cThat was us being nerd master\nsupremes,\u201d Musk said. All of the boys were into the role-playing game,\nwhich requires someone to help set the mood for a contest by imagining and\nthen describing a scene. \u201cYou have entered a room, and there is a chest in\nthe corner. What will you do? . . . You open the chest. You\u2019ve sprung a trap.\nDozens of goblins are on the loose.\u201d Elon excelled at this Dungeon Master\nrole and had memorized the texts detailing the powers of monsters and\nother characters. \u201cUnder Elon\u2019s leadership, we played the role so well and\nwon the tournament,\u201d said Peter Rive. \u201cWinning requires this incredible\nimagination, and Elon really set the tone for keeping people captivated and\ninspired.\u201d\nThe Elon that his peers encountered at school was far less inspirational.\nThroughout middle and high school, Elon bounced around a couple of\ninstitutions. He spent the equivalent of eighth and ninth grades at Bryanston\nHigh School. One afternoon Elon and Kimbal were sitting at the top of a\nflight of concrete stairs eating when a boy decided to go after Elon. \u201cI was\nbasically hiding from this gang that was fucking hunting me down for God\nknows fucking why. I think I accidentally bumped this guy at assembly that\nmorning and he\u2019d taken some huge offense at that.\u201d The boy crept up\nbehind Musk, kicked him in the head, and then shoved him down the stairs.\nMusk tumbled down the entire flight, and a handful of boys pounced on\nhim, some of them kicking Musk in the side and the ringleader bashing his\nhead against the ground. \u201cThey were a bunch of fucking psychos,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cI blacked out.\u201d Kimbal watched in horror and feared for Elon\u2019s life.\nHe rushed down the stairs to find Elon\u2019s face bloodied and swollen. \u201cHe\nlooked like someone who had just been in the boxing ring,\u201d Kimbal said.\nElon then went to the hospital. \u201cIt was about a week before I could get back\nto school,\u201d Musk said. (During a news conference in 2013, Elon disclosed\nthat he\u2019d had a nose job to deal with the lingering effects of this beating.)\nFor three or four years, Musk endured relentless hounding at the hands\nof these bullies. They went so far as to beat up a boy that Musk considered\nhis best friend until the child agreed to stop hanging out with Musk.\n\u201cMoreover, they got him\u2014they got my best fucking friend\u2014to lure me out", "of hiding so they could beat me up,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd that fucking hurt.\u201d\nWhile telling this part of the story, Musk\u2019s eyes welled up and his voice\nquivered. \u201cFor some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going\nto go after me nonstop. That\u2019s what made growing up difficult. For a\nnumber of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at\nschool who tried to beat the shit out of me, and then I\u2019d come home, and it\nwould just be awful there as well. It was just like nonstop horrible.\u201d\nMusk spent the latter stages of his high school career at Pretoria Boys\nHigh School, where a growth spurt and the generally better behavior of the\nstudents made life more bearable. While a public school by definition,\nPretoria Boys has functioned more like a private school for the last hundred\nyears. It\u2019s the place you send a young man to get him ready to attend\nOxford or Cambridge.\nThe boys from Musk\u2019s class remember him as a likable, quiet,\nunspectacular student. \u201cThere were four or five boys that were considered\nthe very brightest,\u201d said Deon Prinsloo, who sat behind Elon in some\nclasses. \u201cElon was not one of them.\u201d Such comments were echoed by a half\ndozen boys who also noted that Musk\u2019s lack of interest in sports left him\nisolated in the midst of an athletics-obsessed culture. \u201cHonestly, there were\njust no signs that he was going to be a billionaire,\u201d said Gideon Fourie,\nanother classmate. \u201cHe was never in a leadership position at school. I was\nrather surprised to see what has happened to him.\u201d\nWhile Musk didn\u2019t have any close friends at school, his eccentric\ninterests did leave an impression. One boy\u2014Ted Wood\u2014remembered\nMusk bringing model rockets to school and blasting them off during breaks.\nThis was not the only hint of his aspirations. During a science-class debate,\nElon gained attention for railing against fossil fuels in favor of solar power\n\u2014an almost sacrilegious stance in a country devoted to mining the earth\u2019s\nnatural resources. \u201cHe always had firm views on things,\u201d said Wood.\nTerency Beney, a classmate who stayed in touch with Elon over the years,\nclaimed that Musk had started fantasizing about colonizing other planets in\nhigh school as well.\nIn another nod to the future, Elon and Kimbal were chatting during a\nclass break outdoors when Wood interrupted them and asked what they\nwere going on about. \u201cThey said, \u2018We are talking about whether there is a\nneed for branch banking in the financial industry and whether we will move", "to paperless banking.\u2019 I remember thinking that was such an absurd\ncomment to make. I said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d*\nWhile Musk might not have been among the academic elite in his class,\nhe was among a handful of students with the grades and self-professed\ninterest to be selected for an experimental computer program. Students were\nplucked out of a number of schools and brought together to learn the\nBASIC, COBOL, and Pascal programming languages. Musk continued to\naugment these technological leanings with his love of science fiction and\nfantasy and tried his hand at writing stories that involved dragons and\nsupernatural beings. \u201cI wanted to write something like Lord of the Rings,\u201d\nhe said.\nMaye viewed these high school years through a mother\u2019s eyes and\nrecounted plenty of tales of Musk performing spectacular academic feats.\nThe video game he wrote, she said, impressed much older, more\nexperienced techies. He aced math exams well beyond his years. And he\nhad that incredible memory. The only reason he did not outrank the other\nboys was a lack of interest in the work prescribed by the school.\nAs Musk saw it, \u201cI just look at it as \u2018What grades do I need to get where\nI want to go?\u2019 There were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just\ndidn\u2019t see the point of learning that. It seemed ridiculous. I\u2019d get a passing\ngrade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers\u2014I got the\nhighest grade you can get in those. There needs to be a reason for a grade.\nI\u2019d rather play video games, write software, and read books than try and get\nan A if there\u2019s no point in getting an A. I can remember failing subjects in\nlike fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother\u2019s boyfriend told me I\u2019d be held\nback if I didn\u2019t pass. I didn\u2019t actually know you had to pass the subjects to\nmove to the next grade. I got the best grades in class after that.\u201d\nAt seventeen, Musk left South Africa for Canada. He has recounted this\njourney quite often in the press and typically leans on two descriptions of\nthe motivation for his flight. The short version is that Musk wanted to get to\nthe United States as quickly as possible and could use Canada as a pit stop\nvia his Canadian ancestry. The second go-to story that Musk relies on has\nmore of a social conscience. South Africa required military service at the\ntime. Musk wanted to avoid joining the military, he has said, because it\nwould have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime.\nWhat rarely gets mentioned is that Musk attended the University of\nPretoria for five months before heading off on his grand adventure. He", "began pursuing physics and engineering but put lackluster effort into the\nwork and soon dropped out of school. Musk characterized the time at\nuniversity as just something to do while he awaited his Canadian\ndocumentation. In addition to being an inconsequential part of his life,\nMusk lazing through school to avoid South Africa\u2019s required military\nservice rather undermines the tale of a brooding, adventurous youth that he\nlikes to tell, which is likely why the stint at the University of Pretoria never\nseems to come up.\nThere\u2019s no question, though, that Musk had been pining to get to the\nUnited States on a visceral level for a long time. Musk\u2019s early inclination\ntoward computers and technology had fostered an intense interest in Silicon\nValley, and his trips overseas had reinforced the idea that America was the\nplace to get things done. South Africa, by contrast, presented far less\nopportunity for an entrepreneurial soul. As Kimbal put it, \u201cSouth Africa\nwas like a prison for someone like Elon.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s opportunity to flee arrived with a change in the law that allowed\nMaye to pass her Canadian citizenship to her children. Musk immediately\nbegan researching how to complete the paperwork for this process. It took\nabout a year to receive the approvals from the Canadian government and to\nsecure a Canadian passport. \u201cThat\u2019s when Elon said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving for\nCanada,\u2019\u201d Maye said. In these pre-Internet days, Musk had to wait three\nagonizing weeks to get a plane ticket. Once it arrived, and without\nflinching, he left home for good.", "3", "CANADA\nM\nUSK\u2019S GREAT ESCAPE TO CANADA WAS NOT WELL\nTHOUGHT OUT. He knew of a great-uncle in Montreal, hopped on a flight\nand hoped for the best. Upon landing in June 1988, Musk found a pay\nphone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle. When that\ndidn\u2019t work, he called his mother collect. She had bad news. Maye had sent\na letter to the uncle before Musk left and received a reply while her son was\nin transit. The uncle had gone to Minnesota, meaning Musk had nowhere to\nstay. Bags in hand, Musk headed for a youth hostel.\nAfter spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city, Musk tried to\ncome up with a long-term plan. Maye had family scattered all across\nCanada, and Musk began reaching out to them. He bought a countrywide\nbus ticket that let him hop on and off as he pleased for one hundred dollars,\nand opted to head to Saskatchewan, the former home of his grandfather.\nAfter a 1,900-mile bus ride, he ended up in Swift Current, a town of fifteen\nthousand people. Musk called a second cousin out of the blue from the bus\nstation and hitched a ride to his house.\nMusk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada.\nHe tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin\u2019s farm located\nin the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there,\nsharing a cake with the family he\u2019d just met and a few strangers from the\nneighborhood. After that, he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in\nVancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after a visit\nto the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the best wage,\nwhich turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for\neighteen dollars an hour. \u201cYou have to put on this hazmat suit and then\nshimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cThen, you have a shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue,\nwhich is still steaming hot, and you have to shovel it through the same hole\nyou came through. There is no escape. Someone else on the other side has\nto shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than thirty", "minutes, you get too hot and die.\u201d Thirty people started out at the beginning\nof the week. By the third day, five people were left. At the end of the week,\nit was just Musk and two other men doing the work.\nAs Musk made his way around Canada, his brother, sister, and mother\nwere figuring out how to get there as well.* When Kimbal and Elon\neventually reunited in Canada, their headstrong, playful natures bloomed.\nElon ended up enrolling at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, in\n1989. (He picked Queen\u2019s over the University of Waterloo because he felt\nthere were more good-looking women at Queen\u2019s.)2 Outside of his studies,\nElon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal, and the two of them\nwould identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then took\nturns cold-calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch.\nAmong the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays\nbaseball team, a business writer for the Globe and Mail, and a top executive\nat the Bank of Nova Scotia, Peter Nicholson. Nicholson remembered the\nboys\u2019 call well. \u201cI was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that\nhad that kind of gumption.\u201d It took six months to get on Nicholson\u2019s\ncalendar, but, sure enough, the Musk brothers made a three-hour train ride\nand showed up on time.\nNicholson\u2019s first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an\nimpression many would share. Both presented themselves well and were\npolite. Elon, though, clearly came off as the geekier, more awkward\ncounterpoint to the charismatic, personable Kimbal. \u201cI became more\nimpressed and fascinated as I talked to them,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThey were\nso determined.\u201d Nicholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at\nthe bank and became his trusted advisor.\nNot long after their initial meeting, Elon invited Peter Nicholson\u2019s\ndaughter Christie to his birthday party. Christie showed up at Maye\u2019s\nToronto apartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was\ngreeted by Elon and about fifteen other people. Elon had never met Christie\nbefore, but he went right up to her and led her to a couch. \u201cThen, I believe\nthe second sentence out of his mouth was \u2018I think a lot about electric cars,\u2019\u201d\nChristie said. \u201cAnd then he turned to me and said, \u2018Do you think about\nelectric cars?\u2019\u201d The conversation left Christie, who is now a science writer,\nwith the distinct impression that Musk was handsome, affable, and a\ntremendous nerd. \u201cFor whatever reason, I was so struck by that moment on", "the sofa,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could tell that this person was very different. He\ncaptivated me in that way.\u201d\nWith her angular features and blond hair, Christie fit Musk\u2019s type, and\nthe two stayed in touch during Musk\u2019s time in Canada. They never really\ndated, but Christie found Musk interesting enough to have lengthy\nconversations with him on the phone. \u201cOne night he told me, \u2018If there was a\nway that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat. I wish there\nwas a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.\u2019 The enormity\nof his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out. It seemed like one\nof the more unusual things I had ever heard.\u201d\nA deeper relationship during this stint in Canada arose between Musk\nand Justine Wilson, a fellow student at Queen\u2019s. Leggy with long, brown\nhair, Wilson radiated romance and sexual energy. Justine had already fallen\nin love with an older man and then ditched him to go to college. Her next\nconquest was meant to wear a leather jacket and be a damaged, James Dean\nsort. As fortune would have it, however, the clean-cut, posh-sounding Musk\nspotted Wilson on campus and went right to work trying to date her. \u201cShe\nlooked pretty great,\u201d Musk said. \u201cShe was also smart and this intellectual\nwith sort of an edge. She had a black belt in tae kwon do and was semi-\nbohemian and, you know, like the hot chick on campus.\u201d He made his first\nmove just outside of her dorm, where he pretended to have bumped into her\nby accident and then reminded her that they had met previously at a party.\nJustine, only one week into school, agreed to Musk\u2019s proposal of an ice\ncream date. When he arrived to pick up Wilson, Musk found a note on the\ndorm room door, notifying him that he\u2019d been stood up. \u201cIt said that she had\nto go study for an exam and couldn\u2019t make it and that she was sorry,\u201d Musk\nsaid. Musk then hunted down Justine\u2019s best friend and did some research,\nasking where Justine usually studied and what her favorite flavor of ice\ncream was. Later, as Justine hid in the student center studying Spanish,\nMusk appeared behind her with a couple of melting chocolate chip ice\ncream cones in hand.\nWilson had dreamed of having a torrid romance with a writer. \u201cI wanted\nto be Sylvia and Ted,\u201d she said. What she fell for instead was a relentless,\nambitious geek. The pair attended the same abnormal-psychology class and\ncompared their grades following an exam. Justine notched a 97, Musk a 98.\n\u201cHe went back to the professor, and talked his way into the two points he\nlost and got a hundred,\u201d Justine said. \u201cIt felt like we were always", "competing.\u201d Musk had a romantic side as well. One time he sent Wilson a\ndozen roses, each with its own note, and he also gifted Wilson a copy of\nThe Prophet filled with handwritten romantic musings. \u201cHe can sweep you\noff your feet,\u201d Justine said.\nDuring their university years, the two youngsters were off and on, with\nMusk having to work hard to keep the relationship going. \u201cShe was hip and\ndated the coolest guys and wasn\u2019t interested in Elon at all,\u201d Maye said. \u201cSo\nthat was hard on him.\u201d Musk pursued a couple of other girls, but kept\nreturning to Justine. Any time she acted cool toward him, Musk responded\nwith his usual show of force. \u201cHe would call very insistently,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou always knew it was Elon because the phone would never stop ringing.\nThe man does not take no for an answer. You can\u2019t blow him off. I do think\nof him as the Terminator. He locks his gaze on to something and says, \u2018It\nshall be mine.\u2019 Bit by bit, he won me over.\u201d\nCollege suited Musk. He worked on being less of a know-it-all, while\nalso finding a group of people who respected his intellectual abilities. The\nuniversity students were less inclined to laugh off or deride his opinionated\ntakes on energy, space, and whatever else was captivating him at the\nmoment. Musk had found people who responded to his ambition rather than\nmocking it, and he fed on this environment.\nNavaid Farooq, a Canadian who grew up in Geneva, ended up in\nMusk\u2019s freshman-year dormitory in the fall of 1990. Both men were placed\nin the international section where a Canadian student would get paired with\na student from overseas. Musk sort of broke the system, since he technically\ncounted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings. \u201cI\nhad a roommate from Hong Kong, and he was a really nice guy,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cHe religiously attended every lecture, which was helpful, since I went\nto the least number of classes possible.\u201d For a time, Musk sold computer\nparts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. \u201cI could build\nsomething to suit their needs like a tricked-out gaming machine or a simple\nword processor that cost less than what they could get in a store,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cOr if their computer didn\u2019t boot properly or had a virus, I\u2019d fix it. I\ncould pretty much solve any problem.\u201d Farooq and Musk bonded over their\nbackgrounds living abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think he makes friends easily, but he is very loyal to those he has,\u201d\nFarooq said. When the video game Civilization was released, the college\nchums spent hours building their empire, much to the dismay of Farooq\u2019s", "girlfriend, who was forgotten in another room. \u201cElon could lose himself for\nhours on end,\u201d Farooq said. The students also relished their loner lifestyles.\n\u201cWe are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel\nawkward,\u201d Farooq said. \u201cWe can think to ourselves and not feel socially\nweird about it.\u201d\nMusk was more ambitious in college than he\u2019d been in high school. He\nstudied business, competed in public speaking contests, and began to\ndisplay the brand of intensity and competitiveness that marks his behavior\ntoday. After one economics exam, Musk, Farooq, and some other students\nin class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to\nascertain how well they did on the test. It soon became clear that Musk had\na firmer grasp on the material than anyone else. \u201cThis was a group of fairly\nhigh achievers, and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve,\u201d Farooq said.\nMusk\u2019s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship.\n\u201cWhen Elon gets into something, he develops just this different level of\ninterest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest\nof humanity.\u201d\nIn 1992, having spent two years at Queen\u2019s, Musk transferred to the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania on a scholarship. Musk saw the Ivy League\nschool as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of\ndual degrees\u2014first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then\na bachelor\u2019s degree in physics. Justine stayed at Queen\u2019s, pursuing her\ndream of becoming a writer, and maintained a long-distance relationship\nwith Musk. Now and again, she would visit him, and the two would\nsometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend.\nMusk blossomed even more at Penn, and really started to feel\ncomfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students. \u201cAt Penn,\nhe met people that thought like him,\u201d Maye said. \u201cThere were some nerds\nthere. He so enjoyed them. I remember going for lunch with them, and they\nwere talking physics things. They were saying, \u2018A plus B equals pi squared\u2019\nor whatever. They would laugh out loud. It was cool to see him so happy.\u201d\nOnce again, however, Musk did not make many friends among the broader\nschool body. It\u2019s difficult to find former students who remember him being\nthere at all. But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi, who\nwould go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to\nthis day as tight with Elon as anyone.", "Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air.\nHe was the artistic, colorful foil to the studious, more buttoned-up Musk.\nBoth of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in\nthe funky freshman dorm. The lackluster social scene did not live up to\nRessi\u2019s expectations, and he talked Musk into renting a large house off\ncampus. They got the ten-bedroom home relatively cheap, since it was a frat\nhouse that had gone unrented. During the week, Musk and Ressi would\nstudy, but as the weekend approached, Ressi, in particular, would transform\nthe house into a nightclub. He covered the windows with trash bags to make\nit pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever\nobjects he could find. \u201cIt was a full-out, unlicensed speakeasy,\u201d Ressi said.\n\u201cWe would have as many as five hundred people. We would charge five\ndollars, and it would be pretty much all you could drink\u2014beer and Jell-O\nshots and other things.\u201d\nCome Friday night, the ground around the house would shake from the\nintensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi\u2019s speakers. Maye visited\none of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the\nwalls and lacquered them with glow-in-the-dark paint. She ended up\nworking the door as the coat check/money taker and grabbed a pair of\nscissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.\nA second house had fourteen rooms. Musk, Ressi, and one other person\nlived there. They fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs\nand came up with other makeshift furniture ideas. Musk returned home one\nday to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted it in\nDay-Glo colors. Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down, painting it black,\nand studying. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s installation art in our party house,\u2019\u201d\nsaid Ressi. Remind Musk of this incident and he\u2019ll respond matter-of-factly,\n\u201cIt was a desk.\u201d\nMusk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke, but he\u2019s not a big\ndrinker and does not really care for the taste of alcohol. \u201cSomebody had to\nstay sober during these parties,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI was paying my own way\nthrough college and could make an entire month\u2019s rent in one night. Adeo\nwas in charge of doing cool shit around the house, and I would run the\nparty.\u201d As Ressi put it, \u201cElon was the most straight-laced dude you have\never met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing.\u201d\nThe only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk\u2019s behavior came\nduring video game binges that could go on for days.", "Musk\u2019s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways\nto harness energy expanded at Penn. In December 1994, he had to come up\nwith a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper\ntitled \u201cThe Importance of Being Solar.\u201d The document started with a bit of\nMusk\u2019s wry sense of humor. At the top of the page, he wrote: \u201cThe sun will\ncome out tomorrow. . . .\u201d\u2014Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable\nenergy. The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based\non materials improvements and the construction of large-scale solar plants.\nMusk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds\nthat can make them more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing\nof the \u201cpower station of the future.\u201d It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in\nspace\u2014each four kilometers in width\u2014sending their juice down to Earth\nvia microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven-kilometer\ndiameter. Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a \u201cvery\ninteresting and well written paper.\u201d\nA second paper talked about taking research documents and books and\nelectronically scanning them, performing optical character recognition, and\nputting all of the information in a single database\u2014much like a mix\nbetween today\u2019s Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper\ndwelled on another of Musk\u2019s favorite topics\u2014ultracapacitors. In the forty-\nfour-page document, Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of\nenergy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars, planes, and\nrockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley,\nhe wrote: \u201cThe end result represents the first new means of storing\nsignificant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the\nbattery and fuel cell. Furthermore, because the Ultracapacitor retains the\nbasic properties of a capacitor, it can deliver its energy over one hundred\ntimes faster than a battery of equivalent weight, and be recharged just as\nquickly.\u201d Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for \u201ca very thorough\nanalysis\u201d with \u201cexcellent financials!\u201d\nThe remarks from the professor were spot-on. Musk\u2019s clear, concise\nwriting is the work of a logician, moving from one point to the next with\nprecision. What truly stood out, though, was Musk\u2019s ability to master\ndifficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then,\nhe showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a\nscientific advance to a for-profit enterprise.", "As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after\ncollege, he briefly considered getting into the videogame business. He\u2019d\nbeen obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming\ninternship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit. \u201cI\nreally like computer games, but then if I made really great computer games,\nhow much effect would that have on the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have\na big effect. Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games, I couldn\u2019t\nbring myself to do that as a career.\u201d\nIn interviews, Musk often makes sure that people know he had some\ntruly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life. As he tells it, he\nwould daydream at Queen\u2019s and Penn and usually end up with the same\nconclusion: he viewed the Internet, renewable energy, and space as the three\nareas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the\nmarkets where he could make a big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in\nall three. \u201cI told all my ex-girlfriends and my ex-wife about these ideas,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt probably sounded like super-crazy talk.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for\nelectric cars, solar energy, and rockets can come off as insecure. It feels as if\nMusk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way. But for Musk, the\ndistinction between stumbling into something and having intent is\nimportant. Musk has long wanted the world to know that he\u2019s different from\nthe run-of-the-mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He wasn\u2019t just sniffing\nout trends, and he wasn\u2019t consumed by the idea of getting rich. He\u2019s been in\npursuit of a master plan all along. \u201cI really was thinking about this stuff in\ncollege,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not some invented story after the fact. I don\u2019t want\nto seem like a Johnny-come-lately or that I\u2019m chasing a fad or just being\nopportunistic. I\u2019m not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I\nthink are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.\u201d", "4", "ELON\u2019S FIRST START-UP\nI\nN THE SUMMER OF 1994, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, took their\nfirst steps toward becoming honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a\nroad trip across the country.\nKimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and\ndone well for himself, running what amounted to a small business. He sold\noff his part of the franchise and pooled the money with what Musk had on\nhand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near\nSan Francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part\nof the drive took them down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There\nthey experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree weather in a car with no\nair-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl\u2019s Jr. burger joints,\nwhere they spent hours recuperating in the cold.\nThe trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty-something\nhijinks and raging capitalist daydreaming. The Web had just started to\nbecome accessible to the public thanks to the rise of directory sites like\nYahoo! and tools like Netscape\u2019s browser. The brothers were tuned in to the\nInternet and thought they might like to start a company together doing\nsomething on the Web. From California to Colorado, Wyoming, South\nDakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming, and talking shit\nbefore heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to\narise from the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn\u2019t\nmeant to be something as ambitious as electronic health records but more of\na system for physicians to exchange information and collaborate. \u201cIt\nseemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted,\u201d Kimbal\nsaid. \u201cI went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of\nit later, but it didn\u2019t fly. We didn\u2019t love it.\u201d\nMusk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley,\nholding down a pair of internships. By day, he worked at Pinnacle Research\nInstitute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a much-ballyhooed start-up\nwith a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be", "used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybrid vehicles. The\nwork also veered\u2014at least conceptually\u2014into more bizarre territory. Musk\ncould talk at length about how ultracapacitors might be used to build laser-\nbased sidearms in the tradition of Star Wars and just about any other\nfuturistic film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy,\nand then the shooter would replace an ultracapacitor at the base of the gun,\nmuch like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away again.\nUltracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies for missiles.\nThey were more resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a\nlaunch and would hold a more consistent charge over long periods of time.\nMusk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as the basis\nfor some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist\nfantasies.\nIn the evenings, Musk headed to Rocket Science Games, a start-up\nbased in Palo Alto that wanted to create the most advanced video games\never made by moving them off cartridges and onto CDs that could hold\nmore information. The CDs would in theory allow them to bring\nHollywood-style storytelling and production quality to the games. A team\nof budding all-stars who were a mix of engineers and film people was\nassembled to pull off the work. Tony Fadell, who would later drive much of\nthe development of both the iPod and iPhone at Apple, worked at Rocket\nScience, as did the guys who developed the QuickTime multimedia\nsoftware for Apple. They also had people who worked on the original Star\nWars effects at Industrial Light & Magic and some who did games at\nLucasArts Entertainment. Rocket Science gave Musk a flavor for what\nSilicon Valley had to offer both from a talent and culture perspective. There\nwere people working at the office twenty-four hours a day, and they didn\u2019t\nthink it at all odd that Musk would turn up around 5 P.M. every evening to\nstart his second job. \u201cWe brought him in to write some very menial low-\nlevel code,\u201d said Peter Barrett, an Australian engineer who helped start the\ncompany. \u201cHe was completely unflappable. After a short while, I don\u2019t\nthink anyone was giving him any direction, and he ended up making what\nhe wanted to make.\u201d\nSpecifically, Musk had been asked to write the drivers that would let\njoysticks and mice communicate with various computers and games.\nDrivers are the same types of annoying files that you have to install to get a\nprinter or camera working with a home computer\u2014true grunt work. A self-", "taught programmer, Musk fancied himself quite good at coding and\nassigned himself to more ambitious jobs. \u201cI was basically trying to figure\nout how you could multitask stuff, so you could read video from a CD,\nwhile running a game at the same time,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAt the time, you could\ndo one or the other. It was this complicated bit of assembly programming.\u201d\nComplicated indeed. Musk had to issue commands that spoke directly to a\ncomputer\u2019s main microprocessor and fiddled with the most basic functions\nthat made the machine work. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind\nApple\u2019s QuickTime, had overseen the hiring of Musk and marveled at his\nability to pull all-nighters. \u201cHe had boundless energy,\u201d Leak said. \u201cKids\nthese days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC\nhacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.\u201d\nMusk found in Silicon Valley a wealth of the opportunity he\u2019d been\nseeking and a place equal to his ambitions. He would return two summers in\na row and then bolt west permanently after graduating with dual degrees\nfrom Penn. He initially intended to pursue a doctorate in materials science\nand physics at Stanford and to advance the work he\u2019d done at Pinnacle on\nultracapacitors. As the story goes, Musk dropped out of Stanford after two\ndays, finding the Internet\u2019s call irresistible. He talked Kimbal into moving\nto Silicon Valley as well, so they could conquer the Web together.\nThe first inklings of a viable Internet business had come to Musk during\nhis internships. A salesperson from the Yellow Pages had come into one of\nthe start-up offices. He tried to sell the idea of an online listing to\ncomplement the regular listing a company would have in the big, fat Yellow\nPages book. The salesman struggled with his pitch and clearly had little\ngrasp of what the Internet actually was or how someone would find a\nbusiness on it. The flimsy pitch got Musk thinking, and he reached out to\nKimbal, talking up the idea of helping businesses get online for the first\ntime.\n\u201cElon said, \u2018These guys don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Maybe\nthis is something we can do,\u2019\u201d Kimbal said. This was 1995, and the brothers\nwere about to form Global Link Information Network, a start-up that would\neventually be renamed Zip2. (For details on the controversy surrounding\nZip2\u2019s founding and Musk\u2019s academic record, see Appendix 1.)\nThe Zip2 idea was ingenious. Few small businesses in 1995 understood\nthe ramifications of the Internet. They had little idea how to get on it and\ndidn\u2019t really see the value in creating a website for their business or even in", "having a Yellow Pages\u2013like listing online. Musk and his brother hoped to\nconvince restaurants, clothing shops, hairdressers, and the like that the time\nhad come for them to make their presence known to the Web-surfing public.\nZip2 would create a searchable directory of businesses and tie this into\nmaps. Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that\neveryone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza\nparlor and the turn-by-turn directions to get there. This may seem obvious\ntoday\u2014think Yelp meets Google Maps\u2014but back then, not even stoners\nhad dreamed up such a service.\nThe Musk brothers brought Zip2 to life at 430 Sherman Avenue in Palo\nAlto. They rented a studio-apartment-sized office\u2014twenty feet by thirty\nfeet\u2014and acquired some basic furniture. The three-story building had its\nquirks. There were no elevators, and the toilets often backed up. \u201cIt was\nliterally a shitty place to work,\u201d said an early employee. To get a fast\nInternet connection, Musk struck a deal with Ray Girouard, an entrepreneur\nwho ran an Internet service provider operation from the floor below the\nZip2 offices. According to Girouard, Musk drilled a hole in the drywall near\nthe Zip2 door and then strung an Ethernet cable down the stairwell to the\nISP. \u201cThey were slow to pay a couple of times but never stiffed me on the\nbill,\u201d Girouard said.\nMusk did all of the original coding behind the service himself, while the\nmore amiable Kimbal looked to ramp up the door-to-door sales operation.\nMusk had acquired a cheap license to a database of business listings in the\nBay Area that would give a business\u2019s name and its address. He then\ncontacted Navteq, a company that had spent hundreds of millions of dollars\nto create digital maps and directions that could be used in early GPS\nnavigation-style devices, and struck a masterful bargain. \u201cWe called them\nup, and they gave us the technology for free,\u201d said Kimbal. Musk merged\nthe two databases together to get a rudimentary system up and running.\nOver time, Zip2\u2019s engineers had to augment this initial data haul with more\nmaps to cover areas outside of major metropolitan areas and to build custom\nturn-by-turn directions that would look good and work well on a home\ncomputer.\nErrol Musk gave his sons $28,000 to help them through this period, but\nthey were more or less broke after getting the office space, licensing\nsoftware, and buying some equipment. For the first three months of Zip2\u2019s\nlife, Musk and his brother lived at the office. They had a small closet where", "they kept their clothes and would shower at the YMCA. \u201cSometimes we ate\nfour meals a day at Jack in the Box,\u201d Kimbal said. \u201cIt was open twenty-four\nhours, which suited our work schedule. I got a smoothie one time, and there\nwas something in it. I just pulled it out and kept drinking. I haven\u2019t been\nable to eat there since, but I can still recite their menu.\u201d\nNext, the brothers rented a two-bedroom apartment. They didn\u2019t have\nthe money or the inclination to get furniture. So there were just a couple of\nmattresses on the floor. Musk somehow managed to convince a young\nSouth Korean engineer to come work at Zip2 as an intern in exchange for\nroom and board. \u201cThis poor kid thought he was coming over for a job at a\nbig company,\u201d Kimbal said. \u201cHe ended up living with us and had no idea\nwhat he was getting into.\u201d One day, the intern drove the Musks\u2019 battered\nBMW 320i to work, and a wheel came off en route. The axle dug into the\nstreet at the intersection of Page Mill Road and El Camino Real, and the\ngroove it carved out remained visible for years.\nZip2 may have been a go-go Internet enterprise aimed at the\nInformation Age, but getting it off the ground required old-fashioned door-\nto-door salesmanship. Businesses needed to be persuaded of the Web\u2019s\nbenefits and charmed into paying for the unknown. In late 1995, the Musk\nbrothers began making their first hires and assembling a motley sales team.\nJeff Heilman, a free-spirited twenty-year-old trying to figure out what to do\nwith his life, arrived as one of Zip2\u2019s first recruits. He\u2019d been watching TV\nlate one night with his dad and seen a Web address printed at the bottom of\nthe screen during a commercial. \u201cIt was for something dot-com,\u201d Heilman\nsaid. \u201cI remember sitting there and asking my dad what we were looking at.\nHe said he didn\u2019t know, either. That\u2019s when I realized I had to go find me\nsome Internet.\u201d Heilman spent a couple of weeks trying to chat up people\nwho could explain the Internet to him and then stumbled on a two-by-two-\ninch Zip2 job listing in the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cInternet Sales Apply\nHere!\u201d it read, and Heilman got the gig. A handful of other salespeople\njoined him and worked for commissions.\nMusk never seemed to leave the office. He slept, not unlike a dog, on a\nbeanbag next to his desk. \u201cAlmost every day, I\u2019d come in at seven thirty or\neight A.M., and he\u2019d be asleep right there on that bag,\u201d Heilman said.\n\u201cMaybe he showered on the weekends. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Musk asked those\nfirst employees of Zip2 to give him a kick when they arrived, and he\u2019d\nwake up and get back to work. While Musk did his possessed coder thing,", "Kimbal became the rah-rah sales leader. \u201cKimbal was the eternal optimist,\nand he was very, very uplifting,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cI had never met anyone\nquite like him.\u201d Kimbal sent Heilman to the high-end Stanford shopping\nmall and to University Avenue, the main drag in Palo Alto, to coax retailers\ninto signing up with Zip2, explaining that a sponsored listing would send a\ncompany to the top of search results. The big problem, of course, was that\nno one was buying. Week after week, Heilman knocked on doors and\nreturned to the office with very little to report in the way of good news. The\nnicest responses came from the people who told Heilman that advertising\non the Internet sounded like the dumbest thing they had ever heard of. Most\noften, the shop owners just told Heilman to leave and stop bothering them.\nWhen lunchtime came around, the Musks would reach into a cigar box\nwhere they kept some cash, take Heilman out, and get the depressing status\nreports on the sales.\nCraig Mohr, another early employee, gave up his job selling real estate\nto hawk Zip2\u2019s service. He decided to court auto dealerships because they\nusually spent lots of money on advertising. He told them about Zip2\u2019s main\nwebsite\u2014www.totalinfo.com\u2014and tried to convince them that demand was\nhigh to get a listing like www.totalinfo.com/toyotaofsiliconvalley. The\nservice did not always work when Mohr demonstrated it or it would load\nvery slowly, as was common back then. This forced him to talk the\ncustomers into imagining Zip2\u2019s potential. \u201cOne day I came back with\nabout nine hundred dollars in checks,\u201d Mohr said. \u201cI walked into the office\nand asked the guys what they wanted me to do with the money. Elon\nstopped pounding his keyboard, leaned out from behind his monitor, and\nsaid, \u2018No way, you\u2019ve got money.\u2019\u201d\nWhat kept the employees\u2019 spirits up were the continuous improvements\nMusk made with the Zip2 software. The service had morphed from a proof-\nof-concept to an actual product that could be used and demoed. Ever\nmarketing savvy, the Musk brothers tried to make their Web service seem\nmore important by giving it an imposing physical body. Musk built a huge\ncase around a standard PC and lugged the unit onto a base with wheels.\nWhen prospective investors would come by, Musk would put on a show and\nroll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a\nmini-supercomputer. \u201cThe investors thought that was impressive,\u201d Kimbal\nsaid. Heilman also noticed that the investors bought into Musk\u2019s slavish\ndevotion to the company. \u201cEven then, as essentially a college kid with zits,", "Elon had this drive that this thing\u2014whatever it was\u2014had to get done and\nthat if he didn\u2019t do it, he\u2019d miss his shot,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\nthe VCs saw\u2014that he was willing to stake his existence on building out this\nplatform.\u201d Musk actually said as much to one venture capitalist, informing\nhim, \u201cMy mentality is that of a samurai. I would rather commit seppuku\nthan fail.\u201d\nEarly on in the Zip2 venture, Musk acquired an important confidant,\nwho tempered some of these more dramatic impulses. Greg Kouri, a\nCanadian businessman in his mid-thirties, had met the Musks in Toronto\nand bought into the early Zip2 brainstorming. The boys had showed up at\nhis door one morning to inform Kouri that they intended to head to\nCalifornia to give the business a shot. Still in his red bathrobe, Kouri went\nback into the house, dug around for a couple of minutes, and came back\nwith a wad of $6,000. In early 1996, he moved to California and joined\nZip2 as a cofounder.\nKouri, who had done a number of real estate deals in the past and had\nactual business experience and skills at reading people, served as the adult\nsupervision at Zip2. The Canadian had a knack for calming Musk and\nended up becoming something of a mentor. \u201cReally smart people sometimes\ndon\u2019t understand that not everyone can keep up with them or go as fast,\u201d\nsaid Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist who would become Zip2\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer. \u201cGreg is one of the few people that Elon would listen to\nand had a way of putting things in context for him.\u201d Kouri also used to\nreferee fistfights between Elon and Kimbal, in the middle of the office.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get in fights with anyone else, but Elon and I don\u2019t have the\nability to reconcile a vision other than our own,\u201d Kimbal said. During a\nparticularly nasty scrap over a business decision, Elon ripped some skin off\nhis fist and had to go get a tetanus shot. Kouri put an end to the fights after\nthat. (Kouri died of a heart attack in 2012 at the age of fifty-one, having\nmade a fortune investing in Musk\u2019s companies. Musk attended his funeral.\n\u201cWe owe him a lot,\u201d said Kimbal.)\nIn early 1996, Zip2 underwent a massive change. The venture capital\nfirm Mohr Davidow Ventures had caught wind of a couple of South African\nboys trying to make a Yellow Pages for the Internet and met with the\nbrothers. Musk, while raw in his presentation skills, pitched the company\nwell enough, and the investors came away impressed with his energy. Mohr\nDavidow invested $3 million into the company.* With these funds in hand,", "the company officially changed its name from Global Link to Zip2\u2014the\nidea being zip to here, zip to there\u2014moved to a larger office at 390\nCambridge Avenue in Palo Alto, and began hiring talented engineers. Zip2\nalso shifted its business strategy. At the time, the company had built one of\nthe best direction systems on the Web. Zip2 would advance this technology\nand take it from focusing just on the Bay Area to having a national scope.\nThe company\u2019s main focus, however, would be an altogether new play.\nInstead of selling its service door-to-door, Zip2 would create a software\npackage that could be sold to newspapers, which would in turn build their\nown directories for real estate, auto dealers, and classifieds. The newspapers\nwere late understanding how the Internet would impact their businesses,\nand Zip2\u2019s software would give them a quick way of getting online without\nneeding to develop all their own technology from scratch. For its part, Zip2\ncould chase bigger prey and get a cut of a nationwide network of listings.\nThis transition of the business model and the company\u2019s makeup would\nbe a seminal moment in Musk\u2019s life. The venture capitalists pushed Musk\ninto the role of chief technology officer and hired Rich Sorkin as the\ncompany\u2019s CEO. Sorkin had worked at Creative Labs, a maker of audio\nequipment, and run the business development group at the company, where\nhe steered a number of investments in Internet start-ups. Zip2\u2019s investors\nsaw him as experienced and clued in to the Web. While Musk agreed to the\narrangement, he came to resent giving up control of Zip2. \u201cProbably the\nbiggest regret the whole time I worked with him was that he had made a\ndeal with the devil with Mohr Davidow,\u201d said Jim Ambras, the vice\npresident of engineering at Zip2. \u201cElon didn\u2019t have any operational\nresponsibilities, and he wanted to be CEO.\u201d\nAmbras had worked at Hewlett-Packard Labs and Silicon Graphics Inc.\nand exemplified the high-caliber talent Zip2 brought on after the first wave\nof money arrived. Silicon Graphics, a maker of high-end computers beloved\nby Hollywood, was the flashiest company of its day and had hoarded the\nelite geeks of Silicon Valley. And yet Ambras used the promise of Internet\nriches to poach a team of SGI\u2019s smartest engineers over to Zip2. \u201cOur\nattorneys got a letter from SGI saying that we were cherry-picking the very\nbest guys,\u201d Ambras said. \u201cElon thought that was fantastic.\u201d\nWhile Musk had exceled as a self-taught coder, his skills weren\u2019t nearly\nas polished as those of the new hires. They took one look at Zip2\u2019s code and\nbegan rewriting the vast majority of the software. Musk bristled at some of", "their changes, but the computer scientists needed just a fraction of the lines\nof code that Musk used to get their jobs done. They had a knack for\ndividing software projects into chunks that could be altered and refined\nwhereas Musk fell into the classic self-taught coder trap of writing what\ndevelopers call hairballs\u2014big, monolithic hunks of code that could go\nberserk for mysterious reasons. The engineers also brought a more refined\nworking structure and realistic deadlines to the engineering group. This was\na welcome change from Musk\u2019s approach, which had been to set overly\noptimistic deadlines and then try to get engineers to work nonstop for days\non end to meet the goals. \u201cIf you asked Elon how long it would take to do\nsomething, there was never anything in his mind that would take more than\nan hour,\u201d Ambras said. \u201cWe came to interpret an hour as really taking a day\nor two and if Elon ever did say something would take a day, we allowed for\na week or two weeks.\u201d\nStarting Zip2 and watching it grow imbued Musk with self-confidence.\nTerence Beney, one of Musk\u2019s high school friends, came to California for a\nvisit and noticed the change in Musk\u2019s character right away. He watched\nMusk confront a nasty landlord who had been giving his mother, who was\nrenting an apartment in town, a hard time. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you\u2019re going to\nbully someone, bully me.\u2019 It was startling to see him take over the situation.\nThe last time I had seen him he was this geeky, awkward kid who would\nsometimes lose his temper. He was the kid you would pick on to get a\nresponse. Now he was confident and in control.\u201d Musk also began\nconsciously trying to manage his criticism of others. \u201cElon is not someone\nwho would say, \u2018I feel you. I see your point of view,\u2019\u201d said Justine.\n\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t have that \u2018I feel you\u2019 dimension there were things that\nseemed obvious to other people that weren\u2019t that obvious to him. He had to\nlearn that a twenty-something-year-old shouldn\u2019t really shoot down the\nplans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with them. He\nlearned to modify his behavior in certain ways. I just think he comes at the\nworld through strategy and intellect.\u201d The personality tweaks worked with\nvarying degrees of success. Musk still tended to drive the young engineers\nmad with his work demands and blunt criticism. \u201cI remember being in a\nmeeting once brainstorming about a new product\u2014a new-car site,\u201d said\nDoris Downes, the creative director at Zip2. \u201cSomeone complained about a\ntechnical change that we wanted being impossible. Elon turned and said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t really give a damn what you think,\u2019 and walked out of the meeting.", "For Elon, the word no does not exist, and he expects that attitude from\neveryone around him.\u201d Periodically, Musk let loose on the more senior\nexecutives as well. \u201cYou would see people come out of the meetings with\nthis disgusted look on their face,\u201d Mohr, the salesman, said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get\nto where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven\nand sure of himself.\u201d\nAs Musk tried to come to terms with the changes the investors had\ninflicted on Zip2, he did enjoy some of the perks of having big-money\nbacking. The financiers helped the Musk brothers with their visas. They\nalso gave them $30,000 each to buy cars. Musk and Kimbal had traded in\ntheir dilapidated BMW for a dilapidated sedan that they spray-painted with\npolka dots. Kimbal upgraded from that to a BMW 3 Series, and Musk\nbought a Jaguar E-Type. \u201cIt kept breaking down, and would arrive at the\noffice on a flatbed,\u201d Kimbal said. \u201cBut Elon always thought big.\u201d*\nAs a bonding exercise one weekend, Musk, Ambras, a few other\nemployees and friends took off for a bike ride through the Saratoga Gap\ntrail in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the riders had been training and\nwere accustomed to strenuous sessions and the summer\u2019s heat. They set up\nthe mountains at a furious pace. After an hour, Russ Rive, Musk\u2019s cousin,\nreached the top and proceeded to vomit. Right behind him were the rest of\nthe cyclists. Then, fifteen minutes later, Musk became visible to the group.\nHis face had turned purple, and sweat poured out of him, and he made it to\nthe top. \u201cI always think back to that ride. He wasn\u2019t close to being in the\ncondition needed for it,\u201d Ambras said. \u201cAnyone else would have quit or\nwalked up their bike. As I watched him climb that final hundred feet with\nsuffering all over his face, I thought, That\u2019s Elon. Do or die but don\u2019t give\nup.\u201d\nMusk continued to be a ball of energy around the office as well. Ahead\nof visits by venture capitalists and other investors, Musk would rally the\ntroops and instruct them all to get on the phone to create a buzzy\natmosphere. He also formed a video-game team to participate in\ncompetitions around Quake, a first-person-shooter game. \u201cWe competed in\none of the first nationwide tournaments,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe came in second,\nand we would have come in first, but one of our top players\u2019 machine\ncrashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard. We won a few\nthousand dollars.\u201d", "Zip2 had remarkable success courting newspapers. The New York Times,\nKnight Ridder, Hearst Corporation, and other media properties signed up to\nits service. Some of these companies contributed $50 million in additional\nfunding for Zip2. Services like Craigslist with its free online classifieds had\njust started to appear, and the newspapers needed some course of action.\n\u201cThe newspapers knew they were in trouble with the Internet, and the idea\nwas to sign up as many of them as possible,\u201d Ambras said. \u201cThey wanted\nclassifieds and listings for real estate, automotive, and entertainment and\ncould use us as a platform for all these online services.\u201d Zip2 acquired a\ntrademark for its \u201cWe Power the Press\u201d slogan and the influx of cash kept\nZip2 growing fast. Company headquarters were soon so crowded that one\ndesk ended up directly in front of the women\u2019s bathroom. In 1997, Zip2\nmoved into flashier, more spacious digs at 444 Castro Street in Mountain\nView.\nIt irritated Musk that Zip2 had become a behind-the-scenes player to the\nnewspapers. He believed the company could offer interesting services\ndirectly to consumers and encouraged the purchase of the domain name\ncity.com with the hopes of turning it into a consumer destination. But the\nlure of the media companies\u2019 money kept Sorkin and the board on a\nconservative path, and they decided to worry about a consumer push down\nthe road.\nIn April 1998, Zip2 announced a blockbuster move to double down on\nits strategy. It would merge with its main competitor CitySearch in a deal\nvalued at around $300 million. The new company would retain the\nCitySearch name, while Sorkin would head up the venture. On paper, the\nunion looked very much like a merger of equals. CitySearch had built up an\nextensive set of directories for cities around the country. It also appeared to\nhave strong sales and marketing teams that would complement the talented\nengineers at Zip2. The merger had been announced in the press and seemed\ninevitable.\nThe opinions on what happened next vary greatly. The logistics of the\nsituation required the two companies to go over each other\u2019s books and to\nfigure out which employees would be fired to avoid a duplication of roles.\nThis process raised some questions about how frank CitySearch had been\nwith its financials and rankled some executives at Zip2 who could see their\npositions being diminished or erased altogether at the new company. One\nfaction inside Zip2 argued that the deal should be abandoned, while Sorkin", "demanded that it go through. Musk, who had been an early advocate of the\ndeal, turned against it. In May 1998, the two companies canceled the\nmerger, and the press pounced, making a big deal of the chaotic bust-up.\nMusk urged Zip2\u2019s board to oust Sorkin and reinstate him as CEO of Zip2.\nThe board declined. Instead, Musk lost his chairman title, and Sorkin was\nreplaced by Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow.\nSorkin considered Musk\u2019s behavior through the whole affair atrocious and\nlater pointed to the board\u2019s reaction and Musk\u2019s demotion as evidence that\nthey felt the same way. \u201cThere was a lot of backlash and finger-pointing,\u201d\nProudian said. \u201cElon wanted to be CEO, but I said, \u2018This is your first\ncompany. Let\u2019s find an acquirer and make some money, so you can do your\nsecond, third, and fourth company.\u2019\u201d\nWith the deal busted, Zip2 found itself in a predicament. It was losing\nmoney. Musk still wanted to go the consumer route, but Proudian feared\nthat would take too much capital. Microsoft had mounted a charge into the\nsame market, and start-ups with mapping, real estate, and automotive ideas\nmultiplied. The Zip2 engineers were deflated and worried that they might\nnot be able to outrun the competition. Then, in February 1999, the PC\nmaker Compaq Computer suddenly offered to pay $307 million in cash for\nZip2. \u201cIt was like pennies from heaven,\u201d said Ed Ho, a former Zip2\nexecutive. Zip2\u2019s board accepted the offer, and the company rented out a\nrestaurant in Palo Alto and threw a huge party. Mohr Davidow had made\nback twenty times its original investment, and Musk and Kimbal had come\naway with $22 million and $15 million, respectively. Musk never\nentertained the idea of sticking around at Compaq. \u201cAs soon as it was clear\nthe company would be sold, Elon was on to his next project,\u201d Proudian said.\nFrom that point on, Musk would fight to maintain control of his companies\nand stay CEO. \u201cWe were overwhelmed and just thought these guys must\nknow what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Kimbal said. \u201cBut they\u2019 didn\u2019t. There was no\nvision once they took over. They were investors, and we got on well with\nthem, but the vision had just disappeared from the company.\u201d\nYears later, after he had time to reflect on the Zip2 situation, Musk\nrealized that he could have handled some of the situations with employees\nbetter. \u201cI had never really run a team of any sort before,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI\u2019d\nnever been a sports captain or a captain of anything or managed a single\nperson. I had to think, Okay, what are the things that affect how a team\nfunctions. The first obvious assumption would be that other people will", "behave like you. But that\u2019s not true. Even if they would like to behave like\nyou, they don\u2019t necessarily have all the assumptions or information that you\nhave in your mind. So, if I know a certain set of things, and I talk to a\nreplica of myself but only communicate half the information, you can\u2019t\nexpect that the replica would come to the same conclusion. You have to put\nyourself in a position where you say, \u2018Well, how would this sound to them,\nknowing what they know?\u2019\u201d\nEmployees at Zip2 would go home at night, come back, and find that\nMusk had changed their work without talking to them, and Musk\u2019s\nconfrontational style did more harm than good. \u201cYeah, we had some very\ngood software engineers at Zip2, but I mean, I could code way better than\nthem. And I\u2019d just go in and fix their fucking code,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI would be\nfrustrated waiting for their stuff, so I\u2019m going to go and fix your code and\nnow it runs five times faster, you idiot. There was one guy who wrote a\nquantum mechanics equation, a quantum probability on the board, and he\ngot it wrong. I\u2019m like, \u2018How can you write that?\u2019 Then I corrected it for\nhim. He hated me after that. Eventually, I realized, Okay, I might have fixed\nthat thing but now I\u2019ve made the person unproductive. It just wasn\u2019t a good\nway to go about things.\u201d\nMusk, the dot-com striver, had been both lucky and good. He had a\ndecent idea, turned it into a real service, and came out of the dot-com tumult\nwith cash in his pockets, which was better than what many of his\ncompatriots could say. The process had been painful. Musk had yearned to\nbe a leader, but the people around him struggled to see how Musk as the\nCEO could work. As far as Musk was concerned, they were all wrong, and\nhe set out to prove his point with what would end up being even more\ndramatic results.", "5", "PAYPAL MAFIA BOSS\nT\nHE SALE OF ZIP2 INFUSED ELON MUSK WITH A NEW BRAND\nOF CONFIDENCE. Much like the video-game characters he adored, Musk\nhad leveled up. He had solved Silicon Valley and become what everyone at\nthe time wanted to be\u2014a dot-com millionaire. His next venture would need\nto live up to his rapidly inflating ambition. This left Musk searching for an\nindustry that had tons of money and inefficiencies that he and the Internet\ncould exploit. Musk began thinking back to his time as an intern at the Bank\nof Nova Scotia. His big takeaway from that job, that bankers are rich and\ndumb, now had the feel of a massive opportunity.\nDuring his time working for the head of strategy at the bank in the early\n1990s, Musk had been asked to take a look at the company\u2019s third-world\ndebt portfolio. This pool of money went by the depressing name of \u201cless-\ndeveloped country debt,\u201d and Bank of Nova Scotia had billions of dollars of\nit. Countries throughout South America and elsewhere had defaulted in the\nyears prior, forcing the bank to write down some of its debt value. Musk\u2019s\nboss wanted him to dig into the bank\u2019s holdings as a learning experiment\nand try to determine how much the debt was actually worth.\nWhile pursuing this project, Musk stumbled upon what seemed like an\nobvious business opportunity. The United States had tried to help reduce the\ndebt burden of a number of developing countries through so-called Brady\nbonds, in which the U.S. government basically backstopped the debt of\ncountries like Brazil and Argentina. Musk noticed an arbitrage play. \u201cI\ncalculated the backstop value, and it was something like fifty cents on the\ndollar, while the actual debt was trading at twenty-five cents,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cThis was like the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize\nit.\u201d Musk tried to remain cool and calm as he rang Goldman Sachs, one of\nthe main traders in this market, and probed around about what he had seen.\nHe inquired as to how much Brazilian debt might be available at the 25-\ncents price. \u201cThe guy said, \u2018How much do you want?\u2019 and I came up with\nsome ridiculous number like ten billion dollars,\u201d Musk said. When the", "trader confirmed that was doable, Musk hung up the phone. \u201cI was thinking\nthat they had to be fucking crazy because you could double your money.\nEverything was backed by Uncle Sam. It was a no-brainer.\u201d\nMusk had spent the summer earning about fourteen dollars an hour and\ngetting chewed out for using the executive coffee machine, among other\nstatus infractions, and figured his moment to shine and make a big bonus\nhad arrived. He sprinted up to his boss\u2019s office and pitched the opportunity\nof a lifetime. \u201cYou can make billions of dollars for free,\u201d he said. His boss\ntold Musk to write up a report, which soon got passed up to the bank\u2019s\nCEO, who promptly rejected the proposal, saying the bank had been burned\non Brazilian and Argentinian debt before and didn\u2019t want to mess with it\nagain. \u201cI tried to tell them that\u2019s not the point,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe point is\nthat it\u2019s fucking backed by Uncle Sam. It doesn\u2019t matter what the South\nAmericans do. You cannot lose unless you think the U.S. Treasury is going\nto default. But they still didn\u2019t do it, and I was stunned. Later in life, as I\ncompeted against the banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave\nme confidence. All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did. If\neveryone else ran off a bloody cliff, they\u2019d run right off a cliff with them. If\nthere was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody\nwas picking it up, they wouldn\u2019t pick it up, either.\u201d\nIn the years that followed, Musk considered starting an Internet bank\nand discussed it openly during his internship at Pinnacle Research in 1995.\nThe youthful Musk lectured the scientists about the inevitable transition\ncoming in finance toward online systems, but they tried to talk him down,\nsaying that it would takes ages for Web security to be good enough to win\nover consumers. Musk, though, remained convinced that the finance\nindustry could do with a major upgrade and that he could have a big\ninfluence on banking with a relatively small investment. \u201cMoney is low\nbandwidth,\u201d he said, during a speech at Stanford University in 2003, to\ndescribe his thinking. \u201cYou don\u2019t need some sort of big infrastructure\nimprovement to do things with it. It\u2019s really just an entry in a database.\u201d\nThe actual plan that Musk concocted was beyond grandiose. As the\nresearchers at Pinnacle had pointed out, people were barely comfortable\nbuying books online. They might take their chances entering a credit card\nnumber but exposing just their bank accounts to the Web was out of the\nquestion to many. Pah. So what? Musk wanted to build a full-service\nfinancial institution online: a company that would have savings and", "checking accounts as well as brokerage services and insurance. The\ntechnology to build such a service was possible, but navigating the\nregulatory hell of creating an online bank from scratch looked like an\nintractable problem to optimists and an impossibility to more level heads.\nThis was not dishing out directions to a pizzeria or putting up a house\nlisting. It was dealing with people\u2019s finances, and there would be real\nrepercussions if the service did not work as billed.\nUndaunted, Musk kicked this new plan into action before Zip2 had even\nbeen sold. He chatted up some of the best engineers at the company to get a\nfeel for who might be willing to join him in another venture. Musk also\nbounced his ideas off some contacts he\u2019d made at the bank in Canada. In\nJanuary 1999, with Zip2\u2019s board seeking a buyer, Musk began to formalize\nhis banking plan. The deal with Compaq was announced the next month.\nAnd in March, Musk incorporated X.com, a finance start-up with a\npornographic-sounding name.\nIt had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian\nbackpacker to becoming a multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With\nhis $22 million, he moved from sharing an apartment with three roommates\nto buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also bought a\n$1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly.\nMusk embraced the newfound celebrity that he\u2019d earned as part of the dot-\ncom millionaire set. He let CNN show up at his apartment at 7 A.M. to film\nthe delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of\nMusk\u2019s place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street,\nwhile Musk stood slack-jawed with his arms folded. \u201cThere are sixty-two\nMcLarens in the world, and I will own one of them,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWow, I\ncan\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually here. That\u2019s pretty wild, man.\u201d\nCNN interspersed video of the car delivery with interviews with Musk.\nThe whole time he looked like a caricature of an engineer who had made it\nbig. Musk\u2019s hair had started thinning, and he had a closely cropped cut that\naccentuated his boyish face. He wore an all-too-big brown sport coat and\nchecked his cell phone from his lavish car, sitting next to his gorgeous\ngirlfriend, Justine, and he seemed spellbound by his life. Musk rolled out\none laughable rich-guy line after another, talking first about the Zip2 deal\n\u2014\u201cReceiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a large number of Ben\nFranklins\u201d\u2014next about the awesomeness of his life\u2014\u201cThere it is,\ngentlemen, the fastest car in the world\u201d\u2014and then about his prodigious", "ambition\u2014\u201cI could go and buy one of the islands in the Bahamas and turn it\ninto my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build\nand create a new company.\u201d The camera crew followed Musk to the X.com\noffices, where his cocksure delivery led to another round of cringe-worthy\nstatements: \u201cI do not fit the picture of a banker,\u201d \u201cRaising fifty million\ndollars is a matter of making a series of phone calls, and the money is\nthere,\u201d \u201cI think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.\u201d\nMusk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car\naway from Ralph Lauren, who had also inquired about buying it. Even very\nwealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve something like a\nMcLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He\ndrove it all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com\noffices. His friends were horrified to see such a work of art covered with\nbird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway. One day, Musk e-mailed\nfellow McLaren owner Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of the\nsoftware maker Oracle, out of the blue to see if he wanted to go race cars\naround a track for fun. Jim Clark, another billionaire who liked fast things,\ncaught wind of the proposal and told a friend that he needed to rush over to\nthe local Ferrari dealership to buy something that could compete. Musk had\njoined the big boys\u2019 club. \u201cElon was super-excited about all of this,\u201d said\nGeorge Zachary, a venture capitalist and close friend of Musk\u2019s. \u201cHe\nshowed me the correspondence with Larry.\u201d The next year, while driving\ndown Sand Hill Road to meet with an investor, Musk turned to a friend in\nthe car and said, \u201cWatch this.\u201d He floored the car, did a lane change, spun\nout, and hit an embankment, which started the car spinning in midair like a\nFrisbee. The windows and wheels were blown to smithereens, and the body\nof the car damaged. Musk again turned to his companion and said, \u201cThe\nfunny part is it wasn\u2019t insured.\u201d The two of them then thumbed a ride to the\nventure capitalist\u2019s office.\nTo his credit, Musk did not fully buy in to this playboy persona. He\nactually plowed the majority of the money he made from Zip2 into X.com.\nThere were practical reasons for this decision. Investors catch a break under\nthe tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of\nmonths. But even by Silicon Valley\u2019s high-risk standards, it was shocking to\nput so much of one\u2019s newfound wealth into something as iffy as an online\nbank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into X.com, leaving him,\nafter taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what", "separates Elon from mere mortals,\u201d said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive,\nwho went on to cofound X.com. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to take an insane amount of\npersonal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up\nin a bus shelter somewhere.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s decision to invest so much money in X.com looks even more\nunusual in hindsight. Much of the point of being a dot-com success in 1999\nwas to prove yourself once, stash away your millions, and then use your\ncredentials to talk other people into betting their money on your next\nventure. Musk would certainly go on to rely on outside investors, but he put\nmajor skin in the game as well. So while Musk could be found on television\ntalking like the rest of the self-absorbed dot-com schmucks, he behaved\nmore like a throwback to Silicon Valley\u2019s earlier days, when the founders of\ncompanies like Intel were willing to take huge gambles on themselves.\nWhere Zip2 had been a neat, useful idea, X.com held the promise of\nfomenting a major revolution. Musk, for the first time, would be\nconfronting a deep-pocketed, entrenched industry head-on with the hopes of\nupending all of the incumbents. Musk also began to hone his trademark\nstyle of entering an ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he\nknew very little about the industry\u2019s nuances bother him in the slightest. He\nhad an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he\ncould run the business better than everyone else. Musk\u2019s ego and\nconfidence had started heading toward the levels that would inspire some\nand leave others thinking of him as pompous and unscrupulous. The\ncreation of X.com would ultimately reveal a great deal about Musk\u2019s\ncreativity, relentless drive, confrontational style, and foibles as a leader.\nMusk would also get another taste of being pushed aside at his own\ncompany and the pain that accompanies a grand vision left unfulfilled.\nMusk assembled what looked like an all-star crew to start X.com. Ho\nhad worked at SGI and Zip2 as an engineer, and his peers marveled at his\ncoding and team-management skills. They were joined by a pair of\nCanadians with finance experience\u2014Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne.\nMusk had met Fricker during his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova\nScotia, and the two really hit it off. A Rhodes scholar, Fricker brought the\nknowledge of the banking world\u2019s mechanics that X.com would need.\nPayne was Fricker\u2019s friend from the Canadian finance community. All four\nmen were considered cofounders of the company, while Musk emerged as\nthe largest shareholder thanks to his hefty up-front investment. X.com", "began, like so many Silicon Valley operations, at a house where the\ncofounders began brainstorming, and then moved to more formal offices at\n394 University Avenue in Palo Alto.\nThe cofounders were aligned philosophically around the idea that the\nbanking industry had fallen behind the times. Visiting a branch bank to\nspeak with a teller seemed pretty archaic now that the Internet had arrived.\nThe rhetoric sounded good, and the four men were enthused. The only thing\nstopping them was reality. Musk had a modicum of banking experience and\nhad resorted to buying a book on the industry to help understand its inner\nworkings. The more the cofounders thought about their plan of attack, the\nmore they realized the regulatory issues blocking the creation of an online\nbank were insurmountable. \u201cAs four and five months went by, the onion\njust kept unwrapping,\u201d said Ho.*\nFrom the outset, there were personality clashes as well. Musk had\nbecome a budding superstar in Silicon Valley and had the press fawning\nover him. This didn\u2019t sit that well with Fricker, who\u2019d moved from Canada\nand pegged X.com as his chance to make a mark on the world as a banking\nwhiz. Fricker, according to numerous people, wanted to run X.com and do\nso in a more conventional manner. He found Musk\u2019s visionary statements to\nthe press about rethinking the entire banking industry silly since the\ncompany was struggling to build much of anything. \u201cWe were out\npromising the sun, moon, and the stars to the media,\u201d Fricker said. \u201cElon\nwould say that this is not a normal business environment, and you have to\nsuspend normal business thinking. He said, \u2018There is a happy-gas factory up\non the hill, and it\u2019s pumping stuff into the Valley.\u2019\u201d Fricker would not be the\nlast person to accuse Musk of overhyping products and playing the public,\nalthough whether this is a flaw or one of Musk\u2019s great talents as a\nbusinessman is up for debate.\nThe squabble between Fricker and Musk came to a quick, nasty end.\nJust five months after X.com had started, Fricker initiated a coup. \u201cHe said\neither he takes over as CEO or he\u2019s just going to take everyone from the\ncompany and create his own company,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI don\u2019t do well with\nblackmail. I said, \u2018You should go do that.\u2019 So he did.\u201d Musk tried to talk Ho\nand some of the other key engineers into staying, but they sided with\nFricker and left. Musk ended up with a shell of a company and a handful of\nloyal employees. \u201cAfter all that went down, I remember sitting with Elon in\nhis office,\u201d said Julie Ankenbrandt, an early X.com employee who stayed.", "\u201cThere were a million laws in place to block something like X.com from\nhappening, but Elon didn\u2019t care. He just looked at me and said, \u2018I guess we\nshould hire some more people.\u2019\u201d*\nMusk had been trying to raise funding for X.com and had been forced to\ngo to venture capitalists and confess that there wasn\u2019t much in the way of a\ncompany left. Mike Moritz, a famed investor from Sequoia Capital, backed\nthe company nonetheless, making a bet on Musk and little else. Musk hit\nthe streets of Silicon Valley once again and managed to attract engineers\nwith his rah-rah speeches about the future of Internet banking. Scott\nAnderson, a young computer scientist, started on August 1, 1999, just a few\ndays after the exodus, and bought right into the vision. \u201cYou look back, and\nit was total insanity,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe had what amounted to a\nHollywood movie set of a website. It barely got past the VCs.\u201d\nWeek by week, more engineers arrived and the vision became more real.\nThe company secured a banking license and a mutual fund license and\nformed a partnership with Barclays. By November, X.com\u2019s small software\nteam had created one of the world\u2019s first online banks complete with FDIC\ninsurance to back the bank accounts and three mutual funds for investors to\nchoose. Musk gave the engineers $100,000 of his own money to conduct\ntheir testing. On the night before Thanksgiving in 1999, X.com went live to\nthe public. \u201cI was there until two A.M.,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThen, I went home\nto cook Thanksgiving dinner. Elon called me a few hours later and asked\nme to come into the office to relieve some of the other engineers. Elon\nstayed there forty-eight straight hours, making sure things worked.\u201d\nUnder Musk\u2019s direction, X.com tried out some radical banking\nconcepts. Customers received a $20 cash card just for signing up to use the\nservice and a $10 card for every person they referred. Musk did away with\nniggling fees and overdraft penalties. In a very modern twist, X.com also\nbuilt a person-to-person payment system in which you could send someone\nmoney just by plugging their e-mail address into the site. The whole idea\nwas to shift away from slow-moving banks with their mainframes taking\ndays to process payments and to create a kind of agile bank account where\nyou could move money around with a couple of clicks on a mouse or an e-\nmail. This was revolutionary stuff, and more than 200,000 people bought\ninto it and signed up for X.com within the first couple of months of\noperation.", "Soon enough, X.com had a major competitor. A couple of brainy kids\nnamed Max Levchin and Peter Thiel had been working on a payment\nsystem of their own at their start-up called Confinity. The duo actually\nrented their office space\u2014a glorified broom closet\u2014from X.com and were\ntrying to make it possible for owners of Palm Pilot handhelds to swap\nmoney via the infrared ports on the devices. Between X.com and Confinity,\nthe small office on University Avenue had turned into the frenzied epicenter\nof the Internet finance revolution. \u201cIt was this mass of adolescent men that\nworked so hard,\u201d Ankenbrandt said. \u201cIt stunk so badly in there. I can still\nsmell it\u2014leftover pizza, body odor, and sweat.\u201d\nThe pleasantries between X.com and Confinity came to an abrupt end.\nThe Confinity founders moved to an office down the street and, like X.com,\nbegan focusing their attention on Web and e-mail-based payments with their\nservice known as PayPal. The companies became locked in a heated battle\nto match each other\u2019s features and attract more users, knowing that whoever\ngot bigger faster would win. Tens of millions of dollars were spent on\npromotions, while millions more were lost battling hackers who had seized\nupon the services as new playgrounds for fraud. \u201cIt was like the Internet\nversion of making it rain at a strip club,\u201d said Jeremy Stoppelman, an\nX.com engineer who went on to become the CEO of Yelp. \u201cYou gave away\nmoney as fast as you could.\u201d\nThe race to win Internet payments gave Musk a chance to show off his\nquick thinking and work ethic. He kept devising plans to counter the\nadvantage PayPal had established on auction sites like eBay. And he rallied\nthe X.com employees to implement the tactics as fast as possible using\nbrute-force appeals to their competitive natures. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t\nanything suave about him,\u201d Ankenbrandt said. \u201cWe all worked twenty hours\na day, and he worked twenty-three hours.\u201d\nIn March 2000, X.com and Confinity finally decided to stop trying to\nspend each other into oblivion and to join forces. Confinity had what looked\nlike the hottest product in PayPal but was paying out $100,000 a day in\nawards to new customers and didn\u2019t have the cash reserves to keep going.\nX.com, by contrast, still had plenty of cash reserves and the more\nsophisticated banking products. It took the lead in setting the merger terms,\nleaving Musk as the largest shareholder of the combined company, which\nwould be called X.com. Shortly after the deal closed, X.com raised $100", "million from backers including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs and\nboasted that it had more than one million customers.*\nThe two companies tried hard to mesh their cultures, with modest\nsuccess. Groups of employees from X.com tied their computer monitors to\ntheir desk chairs with power cords and rolled them down the street to the\nConfinity offices to work alongside their new colleagues. But the teams\ncould never quite see eye to eye. Musk kept championing the X.com brand,\nwhile most everyone else favored PayPal. More fights broke out over the\ndesign of the company\u2019s technology infrastructure. The Confinity team led\nby Levchin favored moving toward open-source software like Linux, while\nMusk championed Microsoft\u2019s data-center software as being more likely to\nkeep productivity high. This squabble may sound silly to outsiders, but it\nwas the equivalent of a religious war to the engineers, many of whom\nviewed Microsoft as a dated evil empire and Linux as the modern software\nof the people. Two months after the merger, Thiel resigned and Levchin\nthreatened to walk out over the technology rift. Musk was left to run a\nfractured company.\nThe technology issues X.com had been facing worsened as the\ncomputing systems failed to keep up with an exploding customer base.\nOnce a week, the company\u2019s website collapsed. Most of the engineers were\nordered to start work designing a new system, which distracted key\ntechnical personnel and left X.com vulnerable to fraud. \u201cWe were losing\nmoney hand over fist,\u201d said Stoppelman. As X.com became more popular\nand its transaction volume exploded, all of its problems worsened. There\nwas more fraud. There were more fees from banks and credit card\ncompanies. There was more competition from start-ups. X.com lacked a\ncohesive business model to offset the losses and turn a profit from the\nmoney it managed. Roelof Botha, the start-up\u2019s chief financial officer and\nnow a prominent venture capitalist at Sequoia, did not think Musk provided\nthe board with a true picture of X.com\u2019s issues. A growing number of other\npeople at the company questioned Musk\u2019s decision-making in the face of all\nthe crises.\nWhat followed was one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley\u2019s long,\nillustrious history of nasty coups. A small group of X.com employees\ngathered one night at Fanny & Alexander, a now-defunct bar in Palo Alto,\nand brainstormed about how to push out Musk. They decided to sell the\nboard on the idea of Thiel returning as CEO. Instead of confronting Musk", "directly with this plan, the conspirators decided to take action behind\nMusk\u2019s back.\nMusk and Justine had been married in January 2000 but had been too\nbusy for a honeymoon. Nine months later, in September, they planned to\nmix business and pleasure by going on a fund-raising trip and ending it with\na honeymoon in Sydney to catch the Olympics. As they boarded their flight\none night, X.com executives delivered letters of no confidence to X.com\u2019s\nboard. Some of the people loyal to Musk had sensed something was wrong,\nbut it was too late. \u201cI went to the office at ten thirty that night, and everyone\nwas there,\u201d Ankenbrandt said. \u201cI could not believe it. I am frantically trying\nto call Elon, but he\u2019s on a plane.\u201d By the time he landed, Musk had been\nreplaced by Thiel.\nWhen Musk finally heard what had happened, he hopped on the next\nplane back to Palo Alto. \u201cIt was shocking, but I will give Elon this\u2014I\nthought he handled it pretty well,\u201d Justine said. For a brief period, Musk\ntried to fight back. He urged the board to reconsider its decision. But when\nit became clear that the company had already moved on, Musk relented. \u201cI\ntalked to Moritz and a few others,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much that I\nwanted to be CEO but more like, \u2018Hey, I think there are some pretty\nimportant things that need to happen, and if I\u2019m not CEO, I\u2019m not sure they\nare going to happen.\u2019 But then I talked to Max and Peter, and it seemed like\nthey would make these things happen. So then, I mean, it\u2019s not the end of\nthe world.\u201d\nMany of the X.com employees who had been with Musk since early on\nwere less than impressed by what had happened. \u201cI was floored by it and\nangry,\u201d said Stoppelman. \u201cElon was sort of a rock star in my view. I was\nvery vocal about how I thought it was bullshit. But I knew fundamentally\nthat the company was doing well. It was a rocket ship, and I wasn\u2019t going to\nleave.\u201d Stoppelman, then twenty-three, went into a conference room and\ntore into Thiel and Levchin. \u201cThey let me vent it all out, and their reaction\nwas part of the reason I stayed.\u201d Others remained embittered. \u201cIt was\nbackhanded and cowardly,\u201d said Branden Spikes, a Zip2 and X.com\nengineer. \u201cI would have been more behind it if Elon had been in the room.\u201d\nBy June 2001, Musk\u2019s influence on the company was fading quickly.\nThat month, Thiel rebranded X.com as PayPal. Musk rarely lets a slight go\nunpunished. Throughout this ordeal, however, he showed incredible\nrestraint. He embraced the role of being an advisor to the company and kept", "investing in it, increasing his stake as PayPal\u2019s largest shareholder. \u201cYou\nwould expect someone in Elon\u2019s position to be bitter and vindictive, but he\nwasn\u2019t,\u201d said Botha. \u201cHe supported Peter. He was a prince.\u201d\nThe next few months would end up being key for Musk\u2019s future. The\ndot-com joyride was coming to a quick end, and people wanted to try to\ncash out in any way possible. When executives from eBay began\napproaching PayPal about an acquisition, the inclination for most people\nwas to sell and sell fast. Musk and Moritz, though, urged the board to reject\na number of offers and hold out for more money. PayPal had revenue of\nabout $240 million per year, and looked like it might make it as an\nindependent company and go public. Musk and Moritz\u2019s resistance paid off\nand then some. In July 2002, eBay offered $1.5 billion for PayPal, and\nMusk and the rest of the board accepted the deal. Musk netted about $250\nmillion from the sale to eBay, or $180 million after taxes\u2014enough to make\nwhat would turn out to be his very wild dreams possible.\nThe PayPal episode was a mixed bag for Musk. His reputation as a\nleader suffered in the aftermath of the deal, and the media turned on him in\nearnest for the first time. Eric Jackson, an early Confinity employee, wrote\nThe PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest of\nPlanet Earth in 2004 and recounted the company\u2019s tumultuous journey. The\nbook painted Musk as an egomaniacal, stubborn jerk, making wrong\ndecisions at every turn, and portrayed Thiel and Levchin as heroic geniuses.\nValleywag, the technology industry gossip site, piled on as well and turned\nbashing Musk into one of its pet projects. The criticisms grew to the point\nthat people started wondering aloud whether or not Musk counted as a true\ncofounder of PayPal or had just ridden Thiel\u2019s coattails to a magical payday.\nThe tone of the book along with the blog posts goaded Musk in 2007 into\nwriting a 2,200-word e-mail to Valleywag meant to set the record straight\nwith his version of events.\nIn the e-mail, Musk let his literary flair loose and gave the public a\ndirect look at his combative side. He described Jackson as \u201ca sycophantic\njackass\u201d and \u201cone notch above an intern,\u201d who had little insight into the\nhigh-level goings-on at the company. \u201cSince Eric worships Peter, the\noutcome was obvious\u2014Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my\nrole is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed,\u201d Musk wrote. Musk\nthen detailed seven reasons why he deserved cofounder status of PayPal,\nincluding his role as its largest shareholder, the hiring of a lot of the top", "talent, the creation of a number of the company\u2019s most successful business\nideas, and his time as CEO when the company went from sixty to several\nhundred employees.\nAlmost everyone I interviewed from the PayPal days leaned toward\nagreeing with Musk\u2019s overall assessment. They said that Jackson\u2019s account\nbordered on fantasy when it came to celebrating the Confinity team over\nMusk and the X.com team. \u201cThere are a lot of PayPal people that suffer\nfrom warped memories,\u201d said Botha.\nBut these same people reached another consensus, saying that Musk had\nmishandled the branding, technology infrastructure, and fraud situations. \u201cI\nthink it would have killed the company if Elon had stayed on as CEO for\nsix more months,\u201d said Botha. \u201cThe mistakes Elon was making at the time\nwere amplifying the risk of the business.\u201d (For more on Musk\u2019s take on the\nPayPal years, see Appendix 2.)\nThe suggestions that Musk did not count as a \u201ctrue\u201d cofounder of\nPayPal seem asinine in retrospect. Thiel, Levchin, and other PayPal\nexecutives have said as much in the years since the eBay deal closed. The\nonly useful thing such criticisms produced were the bombastic\ncounteroffensives from Musk, which revealed touches of insecurity and the\nseriousness with which Musk insists that the historical record reflect his\ntake on events. \u201cHe comes from the school of thought in the public relations\nworld that you let no inaccuracy go uncorrected,\u201d said Vince Sollitto, the\nformer communications chief at PayPal. \u201cIt sets a precedent, and you\nshould fight every out-of-place comma tooth and nail. He takes things very\npersonally and usually seeks war.\u201d\nThe stronger critique of Musk during this period of his life was that he\nhad succeeded to a large degree despite himself. Musk\u2019s traits as a\nconfrontational know-it-all and his abundant ego created deep, lasting\nfractures within his companies. While Musk consciously tried to temper his\nbehavior, these efforts were not enough to win over investors and more\nexperienced executives. At both Zip2 and PayPal, the companies\u2019 boards\ncame to the conclusion that Musk was not yet CEO material. It can also be\nargued that Musk had become a hyperbolic huckster, who overreached and\noversold his companies\u2019 technology. Musk\u2019s biggest detractors have made\nall of these arguments either in public or private and a half dozen or so of\nthem said far worse things to me about his character and actions, describing\nMusk as unethical in business and vicious with his personal attacks. Almost", "universally, these people were unwilling to go on the record with their\ncomments, claiming to be afraid Musk would pursue litigation against them\nor ruin their ability to do business.\nThese criticisms must be weighed against Musk\u2019s track record. He\ndemonstrated an innate ability to read people and technology trends at the\ninception of the consumer Web. While others tried to wrap their heads\naround the Internet\u2019s implications, Musk had already set off on a purposeful\nplan of attack. He envisioned many of the early pieces of technology\u2014\ndirectories, maps, sites that focused on vertical markets\u2014that would\nbecome mainstays on the Web. Then, just as people became comfortable\nwith buying things from Amazon.com and eBay, Musk made the great leap\nforward to full-fledged Internet banking. He would bring standard financial\ninstruments online and then modernize the industry with a host of new\nconcepts. He exhibited a deep insight into human nature that helped his\ncompanies pull off exceptional marketing, technology, and financial feats.\nMusk was already playing the entrepreneur game at the highest level and\nworking the press and investors like few others could. Did he hype things\nup and rub people the wrong way? Absolutely\u2014and with spectacular\nresults.\nBased in large part on Musk\u2019s guidance, PayPal survived the bursting of\nthe dot-com bubble, became the first blockbuster IPO after the 9/11 attacks,\nand then sold to eBay for an astronomical sum while the rest of the\ntechnology industry was mired in a dramatic downturn. It was nearly\nimpossible to survive let alone emerge as a winner in the midst of such a\nmess.\nPayPal also came to represent one of the greatest assemblages of\nbusiness and engineering talent in Silicon Valley history. Both Musk and\nThiel had a keen eye for young, brilliant engineers. The founders of start-\nups as varied as YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp all worked at\nPayPal. Another set of people\u2014including Reid Hoffman, Thiel, and Botha\n\u2014emerged as some of the technology industry\u2019s top investors. PayPal staff\npioneered techniques in fighting online fraud that have formed the basis of\nsoftware used by the CIA and FBI to track terrorists and of software used\nby the world\u2019s largest banks to combat crime. This collection of super-\nbright employees has become known as the PayPal Mafia\u2014more or less the\ncurrent ruling class of Silicon Valley\u2014and Musk is its most famous and\nsuccessful member.", "Hindsight also continues to favor Musk\u2019s unbridled vision over the more\ncautious pragmatism of executives at Zip2 and PayPal. Had it chased\nconsumers as Musk urged, Zip2 may have ended up as a blockbuster\nmapping and review service. As for PayPal, an argument can still be made\nthat the investors sold out too early and should have listened more to\nMusk\u2019s demands to remain independent. By 2014, PayPal had amassed 153\nmillion users and was valued at close to $32 billion as a stand-alone\ncompany. A flood of payment and banking start-ups have appeared as well\n\u2014Square, Stripe, and Simple, to name three among the S\u2019s\u2014that have\nlooked to fulfill much of the original X.com vision.\nIf X.com\u2019s board had been a bit more patient with Musk, there\u2019s good\nreason to believe he would have succeeded with delivery of the \u201conline\nbank to rule them all\u201d that he had set out to create. History has\ndemonstrated that while Musk\u2019s goals can sound absurd in the moment, he\ncertainly believes in them and, when given enough time, tends to achieve\nthem. \u201cHe always works from a different understanding of reality than the\nrest of us,\u201d Ankenbrandt said. \u201cHe is just different than the rest of us.\u201d\nWhile navigating the business tumult of Zip2 and PayPal, Musk found a\nmoment of peace in his personal life. He\u2019d spent years courting Justine\nWilson from afar, flying her out for visits on the weekends. For a long time,\nhis oppressive hours and his roommates put a crimp on the relationship. But\nthe Zip2 sale let Musk buy a place of his own and pay a bit more attention\nto Justine. Like any couple, they had their ups and downs, but that passion\nof young love remained. \u201cWe fought a lot, but when we weren\u2019t fighting,\nthere was a deep sense of compassion\u2014a bond,\u201d Justine said. The couple\nhad been sparring for a few days about phone calls Justine kept getting from\nan ex-boyfriend\u2014\u201cElon didn\u2019t like that\u201d\u2014and had a major spat while\nwalking near the X.com offices. \u201cI remember thinking it was a lot of drama,\nand that if I was going to put up with it, we might as well be married. I told\nhim he should just propose to me,\u201d Justine said. It took Musk a few minutes\nto cool down and then he did just that, proposing on the spot. A few days\nlater, a more chivalrous Musk returned to the sidewalk, got down on bended\nknee, and presented Justine with a ring.\nJustine knew all about Musk\u2019s grim childhood and the intense range of\nemotions he could exhibit. Her romantic sensibilities overrode any\ntrepidation she might have had about these parts of Musk\u2019s history and\ncharacter and centered instead on his strength. Musk often talked fondly", "about Alexander the Great, and Justine saw him as her own conquering\nhero. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid of responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t run from\nthings. He wanted to get married and have kids early on.\u201d Musk also\nexuded a confidence and passion that made Justine think life with him\nwould always be okay. \u201cMoney is not his motivation, and, quite frankly, I\nthink it just happens for him,\u201d Justine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just there. He knows he can\ngenerate it.\u201d\nAt their wedding reception, Justine encountered the other side of the\nconquering hero. Musk pulled Justine close while they danced, and\ninformed her, \u201cI am the alpha in this relationship.\u201d3 Two months later,\nJustine signed a postnuptial financial agreement that would come back to\nhaunt her and entered into an enduring power struggle. She described the\nsituation years later in an article for Marie Claire, writing, \u201cHe was\nconstantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. \u2018I am your wife,\u2019 I\ntold him repeatedly, \u2018not your employee.\u2019 \u2018If you were my employee,\u2019 he\nsaid just as often, \u2018I would fire you.\u2019\u201d\nThe newlyweds were not helped by the drama at X.com. They\u2019d put off\ntheir honeymoon and then had it derailed by the coup. It took until late\nDecember 2000 for things to calm down enough for Musk to take his first\nvacation in years. He arranged a two-week trip, with the first part taking\nplace in Brazil and the second in South Africa at a game reserve near the\nMozambique border. While in Africa, Musk contracted the most virulent\nversion of malaria\u2014falciparum malaria\u2014which accounts for the vast\nmajority of malaria deaths.\nMusk returned to California in January, which is when the illness took\nhold. He started to get sick and was bedridden for a few days before Justine\ntook him to a doctor who then ordered that Musk be rushed in an ambulance\nto Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City.* Doctors there misdiagnosed and\nmistreated his condition to the point that Musk was near death. \u201cThen, there\nhappened to be a guy visiting from another hospital who had seen a lot\nmore malaria cases,\u201d Musk said. He spied Musk\u2019s blood work in the lab and\nordered an immediate maximum dosage of doxycycline, an antibiotic. The\ndoctor told Musk that if he had turned up a day later, the medicine likely\nwould no longer have been effective.\nMusk spent ten agonizing days in the intensive care unit. The\nexperience shocked Justine. \u201cHe\u2019s built like a tank,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a\nlevel of stamina and an ability to deal with levels of stress that I\u2019ve never", "seen in anyone else. To see him laid low like that in total misery was like a\nvisit to an alternate universe.\u201d It took Musk six months to recover. He lost\nforty-five pounds over the course of the illness and had a closet full of\nclothes that no longer fit. \u201cI came very close to dying,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nmy lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.\u201d", "6", "MICE IN SPACE\nE\nLON MUSK TURNED THIRTY IN JUNE 2001, and the birthday hit\nhim hard. \u201cI\u2019m no longer a child prodigy,\u201d he told Justine, only half joking.\nThat same month X.com officially changed its name to PayPal, providing a\nharsh reminder that the company had been ripped away from Musk and\ngiven to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as\nakin to \u201ceating glass and staring into the abyss,\u201d4 had gotten old and so had\nSilicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade show where\neveryone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about\nfunding, IPOs, and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the\ncrazy hours they worked, and Justine would just laugh, knowing Musk had\nlived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they could\nimagine. \u201cI had friends who complained that their husbands came home at\nseven or eight,\u201d she said. \u201cElon would come home at eleven and work some\nmore. People didn\u2019t always get the sacrifice he made in order to be where\nhe was.\u201d\nThe idea of escaping this incredibly lucrative rat race started to grow\nmore and more appealing. Musk\u2019s entire life had been about chasing a\nbigger stage, and Palo Alto seemed more like a stepping-stone than a final\ndestination. The couple decided to move south and begin their family and\nthe next chapter of their lives in Los Angeles.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an element to him that likes the style and the excitement and\ncolor of a place like L.A.,\u201d said Justine. \u201cElon likes to be where the action\nis.\u201d A small group of Musk\u2019s friends who felt similarly had also decamped\nto Los Angeles for what would be a wild couple of years.\nIt wasn\u2019t just Los Angeles\u2019s glitz and grandeur that attracted Musk. It\nwas also the call of space. After being pushed out of PayPal, Musk had\nstarted to revisit his childhood fantasies around rocket ships and space\ntravel and to think that he might have a greater calling than creating Internet\nservices. The changes in his attitude and thinking soon became obvious to\nhis friends, including a group of PayPal executives who had gathered in Las", "Vegas one weekend to celebrate the company\u2019s success. \u201cWe\u2019re all hanging\nout in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some\nobscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been\nbought on eBay,\u201d said Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor. \u201cHe was\nstudying it and talking openly about space travel and changing the world.\u201d\nMusk had picked Los Angeles with intent. It gave him access to space\nor at least the space industry. Southern California\u2019s mild, consistent weather\nhad made it a favored city of the aeronautics industry since the 1920s, when\nthe Lockheed Aircraft Company set up shop in Hollywood. Howard\nHughes, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, Boeing, and myriad other people and\norganizations have performed much of their manufacturing and cutting-\nedge experimentation in and around Los Angeles. Today the city remains a\nmajor hub for the military\u2019s aeronautics work and commercial activity.\nWhile Musk didn\u2019t know exactly what he wanted to do in space, he realized\nthat just by being in Los Angeles he would be surrounded by the world\u2019s\ntop aeronautics thinkers. They could help him refine any ideas, and there\nwould be plenty of recruits to join his next venture.\nMusk\u2019s first interactions with the aeronautics community were with an\neclectic collection of space enthusiasts, members of a nonprofit group\ncalled the Mars Society. Dedicated to exploring and settling the Red Planet,\nthe Mars Society planned to hold a fund-raiser in mid-2001. The $500-per-\nplate event was to take place at the house of one of the well-off Mars\nSociety members, and invitations to the usual characters had been mailed\nout. What stunned Robert Zubrin, the head of the group, was the reply from\nsomeone named Elon Musk, whom no one could remember inviting. \u201cHe\ngave us a check for five thousand dollars,\u201d Zubrin said. \u201cThat made\neveryone take notice.\u201d Zubrin began researching Musk, determined he was\nrich, and invited him for coffee ahead of the dinner. \u201cI wanted to make sure\nhe knew the projects we had under way,\u201d Zubrin said. He proceeded to\nregale Musk with tales of the research center the society had built in the\nArctic to mimic the tough conditions of Mars and the experiments they had\nbeen running for something called the Translife Mission, in which there\nwould be a spinning capsule orbiting Earth that was piloted by a crew of\nmice. \u201cIt would spin to give them one-third gravity\u2014the same you would\nhave on Mars\u2014and they would live there and reproduce,\u201d Zubrin told\nMusk.", "When it was time for dinner, Zubrin placed Musk at the VIP table next\nto himself, the director and space buff James Cameron, and Carol Stoker, a\nplanetary scientist for NASA with a deep interest in Mars. \u201cElon is so\nyouthful-looking and at that time he looked like a little boy,\u201d Stoker said.\n\u201cCameron was chatting him up right away to invest in his next movie, and\nZubrin was trying to get him to make a big donation to the Mars Society.\u201d\nIn return for being hounded for cash, Musk probed about for ideas and\ncontacts. Stoker\u2019s husband was an aerospace engineer at NASA working on\na concept for an airplane that would glide over Mars looking for water.\nMusk loved that. \u201cHe was much more intense than some of the other\nmillionaires,\u201d Zubrin said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know a lot about space, but he had a\nscientific mind. He wanted to know exactly what was being planned in\nregards to Mars and what the significance would be.\u201d Musk took to the\nMars Society right away and joined its board of directors. He donated\nanother $100,000 to fund a research station in the desert as well.\nMusk\u2019s friends were not entirely sure what to make of his mental state.\nHe\u2019d lost a tremendous amount of weight fighting off malaria and looked\nalmost skeletal. With little prompting, Musk would start expounding on his\ndesire to do something meaningful with his life\u2014something lasting. His\nnext move had to be either in solar or in space. \u201cHe said, \u2018The logical thing\nto happen next is solar, but I can\u2019t figure out how to make any money out of\nit,\u2019\u201d said George Zachary, the investor and close friend of Musk\u2019s, recalling\na lunch date at the time. \u201cThen he started talking about space, and I thought\nhe meant office space like a real estate play.\u201d Musk had actually started\nthinking bigger than the Mars Society. Rather than send a few mice into\nEarth\u2019s orbit, Musk wanted to send them to Mars. Some very rough\ncalculations done at the time suggested that the journey would cost $15\nmillion. \u201cHe asked if I thought that was crazy,\u201d Zachary said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Do\nthe mice come back? Because, if they don\u2019t, yeah, most people will think\nthat\u2019s crazy.\u2019\u201d As it turned out, the mice were not only meant to go to Mars\nand come back but were also meant to procreate along the way, during a\njourney that would take months. Jeff Skoll, another one of Musk\u2019s friends\nwho made a fortune at eBay, pointed out that the fornicating mice would\nneed a hell of a lot of cheese and bought Musk a giant wheel of Le Brou\u00e8re,\na type of Gruy\u00e8re.\nMusk did not mind becoming the butt of cheese jokes. The more he\nthought about space, the more important its exploration seemed to him. He", "felt as if the public had lost some of its ambition and hope for the future.\nThe average person might see space exploration as a waste of time and\neffort and rib him for talking about the subject, but Musk thought about\ninterplanetary travel in a very earnest way. He wanted to inspire the masses\nand reinvigorate their passion for science, conquest, and the promise of\ntechnology.\nHis fears that mankind had lost much of its will to push the boundaries\nwere reinforced one day when Musk went to the NASA website. He\u2019d\nexpected to find a detailed plan for exploring Mars and instead found\nbupkis. \u201cAt first I thought, jeez, maybe I\u2019m just looking in the wrong\nplace,\u201d Musk once told Wired. \u201cWhy was there no plan, no schedule? There\nwas nothing. It seemed crazy.\u201d Musk believed that the very idea of America\nwas intertwined with humanity\u2019s desire to explore. He found it sad that the\nAmerican agency tasked with doing audacious things in space and\nexploring new frontiers as its mission seemed to have no serious interest in\ninvestigating Mars at all. The spirit of Manifest Destiny had been deflated\nor maybe even come to a depressing end, and hardly anyone seemed to\ncare.\nLike so many quests to revitalize America\u2019s soul and bring hope to all\nof mankind, Musk\u2019s journey began in a hotel conference room. By this\ntime, Musk had built up a decent network of contacts in the space industry,\nand he brought the best of them together at a series of salons\u2014sometimes at\nthe Renaissance hotel at the Los Angeles airport and sometimes at the\nSheraton hotel in Palo Alto. Musk had no formal business plan for these\npeople to debate. He mostly wanted them to help him develop the mice-to-\nMars idea or at least to come up with something comparable. Musk hoped\nto hit on a grand gesture for mankind\u2014some type of event that would\ncapture the world\u2019s attention, get people thinking about Mars again, and\nhave them reflect on man\u2019s potential. The scientists and luminaries at the\nmeetings were to figure out a spectacle that would be technically feasible at\na price tag of approximately $20 million. Musk resigned from his position\nas a director of the Mars Society and announced his own organization\u2014the\nLife to Mars Foundation.\nThe collection of talent attending these sessions in 2001 was impressive.\nScientists showed up from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL.\nJames Cameron appeared, lending some celebrity to the affair. Also\nattending was Michael Griffin, whose academic credentials were", "spectacular and included degrees in aerospace engineering, electrical\nengineering, civil engineering, and applied physics. Griffin had worked for\nthe CIA\u2019s venture capital arm called In-Q-Tel, at NASA, and at JPL and was\njust in the process of leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of\nsatellites and spacecraft, where he had been chief technical officer and the\ngeneral manager of the space systems group. It could be argued that no one\non the planet knew more about the realities of getting things into space than\nGriffin, and he was working for Musk as space thinker in chief. (Four years\nlater, in 2005, Griffin took over as head of NASA.)\nThe experts were thrilled to have another rich guy appear who was\nwilling to fund something interesting in space. They happily debated the\nmerits and feasibility of sending up rodents and watching them hump. But,\nas the discussion wore on, a consensus started to build around pursuing a\ndifferent project\u2014something called \u201cMars Oasis.\u201d Under this plan, Musk\nwould buy a rocket and use it to shoot what amounted to a robotic\ngreenhouse to Mars. A group of researchers had already been working on a\nspace-ready growth chamber for plants. The idea was to modify their\nstructure, so that it could open up briefly and suck in some of the Martian\nregolith, or soil, and then use it to grow a plant, which would in turn\nproduce the first oxygen on Mars. Much to Musk\u2019s liking, this new plan\nseemed both ostentatious and feasible.\nMusk wanted the structure to have a window and a way to send a video\nfeedback to Earth, so that people could watch the plant grow. The group\nalso talked about sending out kits to students around the country who would\ngrow their own plants simultaneously and take notice, for example, that the\nMartian plant could grow twice as high as its Earth-bound counterpart in the\nsame amount of time. \u201cThis concept had been floating around in various\nforms for a while,\u201d said Dave Bearden, a space industry veteran who\nattended the meetings. \u201cIt would be, yes, there is life on Mars, and we put it\nthere. The hope was that it might turn on a light for thousands of kids that\nthis place is not that hostile. Then they might start thinking, Maybe we\nshould go there.\u201d Musk\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea started to inspire the\ngroup, many of whom had grown cynical about anything novel happening\nin space again. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart, very driven guy with a huge ego,\u201d\nBearden said. \u201cAt one point someone mentioned that he might become Time\nmagazine\u2019s Man of the Year, and you could see him light up. He has this\nbelief that he is the guy who can change the world.\u201d", "The main thing troubling the space experts was Musk\u2019s budget.\nFollowing the salons, it seemed like Musk wanted to spend somewhere\nbetween $20 million and $30 million on the stunt, and everyone knew that\nthe cost of a rocket launch alone would eat up that money and then some.\n\u201cIn my mind, you needed two hundred million dollars to do it right,\u201d\nBearden said. \u201cBut people were reluctant to bring too much reality into the\nsituation too early and just get the whole idea killed.\u201d Then there were the\nimmense engineering challenges that would need solving. \u201cTo have a big\nwindow on this thing was a real thermal problem,\u201d Bearden said. \u201cYou\ncould not keep the container warm enough to keep anything alive.\u201d\nScooping Martian soil into the structure seemed not only hard to do\nphysically but also like a flat-out bad idea since the regolith would be toxic.\nFor a while, the scientists debated growing the plant in a nutrient-rich gel\ninstead, but that felt like cheating and like it might undermine the whole\npoint of the endeavor. Even the optimistic moments were awash in\nunknowns. One scientist found some very resilient mustard seeds and\nthought they could possibly survive a treated version of the Martian soil.\n\u201cThere was a pretty big downside if the plant didn\u2019t survive,\u201d Bearden said.\n\u201cYou have this dead garden on Mars that ends up giving off the opposite of\nthe intended effect.\u201d*\nMusk never flinched. He turned some of the volunteer thinkers into\nconsultants, and put them to work on the plant machine\u2019s design. He also\nplotted a trip to Russia to find out exactly how much a launch would cost.\nMusk intended to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or\nICBM, from the Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help with\nthis, Musk reached out to Jim Cantrell, an unusual fellow who had done a\nmix of classified and unclassified work for the United States and other\ngovernments. Among other claims to fame, Cantrell had been accused of\nespionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians after a\nsatellite deal went awry. \u201cAfter a couple of weeks, Al Gore made some\ncalls, and it got worked out,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do\nwith the Russians again\u2014ever.\u201d Musk had other ideas.\nCantrell was driving his convertible on a hot July evening in Utah when\na call came in. \u201cThis guy in a funny accent said, \u2018I really need to talk to\nyou. I am a billionaire. I am going to start a space program.\u2019\u201d Cantrell could\nnot hear Musk well\u2014he thought his name was Ian Musk\u2014and said he\nwould call back once he got home. The two men didn\u2019t exactly trust each", "other at the outset. Musk refused to give Cantrell his cell phone number and\nmade the call from his fax machine. Cantrell found Musk both intriguing\nand all too eager. \u201cHe asked if there was an airport near me and if I could\nmeet the next day,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cMy red flags started going off.\u201d Fearing\none of his enemies was trying to orchestrate an elaborate setup, Cantrell\ntold Musk to meet him at the Salt Lake City airport, where he would rent a\nconference room near the Delta lounge. \u201cI wanted him to meet me behind\nsecurity so he couldn\u2019t pack a gun,\u201d Cantrell said. When the meeting finally\ntook place, Musk and Cantrell hit it off. Musk rolled out his \u201chumans need\nto become a multiplanetary species\u201d speech, and Cantrell said that if Musk\nwas really serious, he\u2019d be willing to go to Russia\u2014again\u2014and help buy a\nrocket.\nIn late October 2001, Musk, Cantrell, and Adeo Ressi, Musk\u2019s friend\nfrom college, boarded a commercial flight to Moscow. Ressi had been\nplaying the role of Musk\u2019s guardian and trying to ascertain whether his best\nfriend had started to lose his mind. Compilation videos of rockets exploding\nwere made, and interventions were held with Musk\u2019s friends trying to talk\nhim out of wasting his money. While these measures failed, Adeo went\nalong to Russia to try to contain Musk as best as he could. \u201cAdeo would call\nme to the side and say, \u2018What Elon is doing is insane. A philanthropic\ngesture? That\u2019s crazy,\u2019\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cHe was seriously worried but was\ndown with the trip.\u201d And why not? The men were heading to Russia at the\nheight of its freewheeling post-Soviet days when rich guys could apparently\nbuy space missiles on the open market.\nTeam Musk would grow to include Mike Griffin, and meet with the\nRussians three times over a period of four months.* The group set up a few\nmeetings with companies like NPO Lavochkin, which had made probes\nintended for Mars and Venus for the Russian Federal Space Agency, and\nKosmotras, a commercial rocket launcher. The appointments all seemed to\ngo the same way, following Russian decorum. The Russians, who often skip\nbreakfast, would ask to meet around 11 A.M. at their offices for an early\nlunch. Then there would be small talk for an hour or more as the meeting\nattendees picked over a spread of sandwiches, sausages, and, of course,\nvodka. At some point during this process, Griffin usually started to lose his\npatience. \u201cHe suffers fools very poorly,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking\naround and wondering when we\u2019re going to get down to fucking business.\u201d\nThe answer was not soon. After lunch came a lengthy smoking and coffee-", "drinking period. Once all of the tables were cleared, the Russian in charge\nwould turn to Musk and ask, \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re interested in buying?\u201d The\nbig windup may not have bothered Musk as much if the Russians had taken\nhim more seriously. \u201cThey looked at us like we were not credible people,\u201d\nCantrell said. \u201cOne of their chief designers spit on me and Elon because he\nthought we were full of shit.\u201d\nThe most intense meeting occurred in an ornate, neglected,\nprerevolutionary building near downtown Moscow. The vodka shots started\n\u2014\u201cTo space!\u201d \u201cTo America!\u201d\u2014while Musk sat on $20 million, which he\nhoped would be enough to buy three ICBMs that could be retooled to go to\nspace. Buzzed from the vodka, Musk asked point-blank how much a missile\nwould cost. The reply: $8 million each. Musk countered, offering $8 million\nfor two. \u201cThey sat there and looked at him,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cAnd said\nsomething like, \u2018Young boy. No.\u2019 They also intimated that he didn\u2019t have\nthe money.\u201d At this point, Musk had decided the Russians were either not\nserious about doing business or determined to part a dot-com millionaire\nfrom as much of his money as possible. He stormed out of the meeting.\nThe Team Musk mood could not have been worse. It was near the end\nof February 2002, and they went outside to hail a cab and drove straight to\nthe airport surrounded by the snow and dreck of the Moscow winter. Inside\nthe cab, no one talked. Musk had come to Russia filled with optimism about\nputting on a great show for mankind and was now leaving exasperated and\ndisappointed by human nature. The Russians were the only ones with\nrockets that could possibly fit within Musk\u2019s budget. \u201cIt was a long drive,\u201d\nCantrell said. \u201cWe sat there in silence looking at the Russian peasants\nshopping in the snow.\u201d The somber mood lingered all the way to the plane,\nuntil the drink cart arrived. \u201cYou always feel particularly good when the\nwheels lift off in Moscow,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018My God. I made it.\u2019\nSo, Griffin and I got drinks and clinked our glasses.\u201d Musk sat in the row in\nfront of them, typing on his computer. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, Fucking nerd. What\ncan he be doing now?\u201d At which point Musk wheeled around and flashed a\nspreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this\nrocket ourselves.\u201d\nGriffin and Cantrell had downed a couple of drinks by this time and\nwere too deflated to entertain a fantasy. They knew all too well the stories\nof gung-ho millionaires who thought they could conquer space only to lose\ntheir fortunes. Just the year before, Andrew Beal, a real estate and finance", "whiz in Texas, folded his aerospace company after having poured millions\ninto a massive test site. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, Yeah, you and whose fucking\narmy,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cBut, Elon says, \u2018No, I\u2019m serious. I have this\nspreadsheet.\u2019\u201d Musk passed his laptop over to Griffin and Cantrell, and they\nwere dumbfounded. The document detailed the costs of the materials\nneeded to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s\ncalculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a\nmodest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized\nin carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. The\nspreadsheet also laid out the hypothetical performance characteristics of the\nrocket in fairly impressive detail. \u201cI said, \u2018Elon, where did you get this?\u2019\u201d\nCantrell said.\nMusk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics\nbehind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed Rocket Propulsion\nElements, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, and Aerothermodynamics of\nGas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion, along with several more seminal texts.\nMusk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and\nhad emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets\ncould and should be made much cheaper than what the Russians were\noffering. Forget the mice. Forget the plant with its own video feed growing\n\u2014or possibly dying\u2014on Mars. Musk would inspire people to think about\nexploring space again by making it cheaper to explore space.\nAs word traveled around the space community about Musk\u2019s plans,\nthere was a collective ho-hum. People like Zubrin had seen this show many\ntimes before. \u201cThere was a string of zillionaires that got sold a good story\nby an engineer,\u201d Zubrin said. \u201cCombine my brains and your money, and we\ncan build a rocket ship that will be profitable and open up the space frontier.\nThe techies usually ended up spending the rich guy\u2019s money for two years,\nand then the rich guy gets bored and shuts the thing down. With Elon,\neveryone gave a sigh and said, \u2018Oh well. He could have spent ten million\ndollars to send up the mice, but instead he\u2019ll spend hundreds of millions and\nprobably fail like all the others that proceeded him.\u2019\u201d\nWhile well aware of the risks tied to starting a rocket company, Musk\nhad at least one reason to think he might succeed where others had failed.\nThat reason\u2019s name was Tom Mueller.\nMueller grew up the son of a logger in the tidy Idaho town of St.\nMaries, where he developed a reputation as an oddball. While the rest of the", "kids were outside exploring the woods in winter, Mueller stayed warm in\nthe library reading books or watching Star Trek at his house. He also\ntinkered. Walking to grade school one day, Mueller discovered a smashed\nclock in an alley and turned it into a pet project. Each day, he fixed some\npart of the clock\u2014a gear, a spring\u2014until he got it working. A similar thing\nhappened with the family\u2019s lawn mower, which Mueller disassembled one\nafternoon on the front lawn for fun. \u201cMy dad came home and was so mad\nbecause he thought he\u2019d have to buy a new mower,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cBut I\nput it back together, and it ran.\u201d Mueller then got stuck on rockets. He\nstarted buying mail order kits and following the instructions to build small\nrockets. Rather quickly, Mueller graduated to constructing his own devices.\nAt the age of twelve, he crafted a mock-up space shuttle that could be\nattached to a rocket, sent up into the air, and then glide back to the ground.\nFor a science project a couple of years later, Mueller borrowed his dad\u2019s\noxyacetylene welding equipment to make a rocket engine prototype.\nMueller cooled the device by placing it upside down in a coffee can full of\nwater\u2014\u201cI could run it like that all day long\u201d\u2014and invented equally creative\nways to measure its performance. The machine was good enough for\nMueller to win a couple of regional science fair competitions and end up at\nan international event. \u201cThat\u2019s where I promptly got my ass kicked,\u201d\nMueller said.\nTall, lanky, and with a rectangular face, Mueller is an easygoing sort\nwho muddled through college for a bit, teaching his friends how to make\nsmoke bombs, and then eventually settled down and did well as a\nmechanical engineering student. Fresh out of college, he worked for Hughes\nAircraft on satellites\u2014\u201cIt wasn\u2019t rockets, but it was close\u201d\u2014and then went\nto TRW Space & Electronics. It was the latter half of the 1980s, and Ronald\nReagan\u2019s Star Wars program had the space gearheads dreaming about\nkinetic weapons and all sorts of mayhem. At TRW, Mueller experimented\nwith crazy types of propellants and oversaw the development of the\ncompany\u2019s TR-106 engine, a giant machine fueled by liquid oxygen and\nhydrogen. As a hobby, Mueller hung out with a couple hundred amateur\nrocketry buffs in the Reaction Research Society, a group formed in 1943 to\nencourage the building and firing of rockets. On the weekends, Mueller\ntraveled out to the Mojave Desert with the other RRS members to push the\nlimits of amateur machines. Mueller was one of the club\u2019s standouts, able to\nbuild things that actually worked, and could experiment with some of the", "more radical concepts that were quashed by his conservative bosses at\nTRW. His crowning achievement was an eighty-pound engine that could\nproduce thirteen thousand pounds of thrust and earned accolades as the\nworld\u2019s largest liquid-fuel rocket engine built by an amateur. \u201cI still keep\nthe rockets hanging in my garage,\u201d Mueller said.\nIn January 2002, Mueller was hanging out in the workshop of John\nGarvey, who had left a job at the aerospace company McDonnell Douglas\nto start building his own rockets. Garvey\u2019s facility was in Huntington\nBeach, where he rented an industrial space about the size of a six-car\ngarage. The two men were fiddling around with the eighty-pound engine\nwhen Garvey mentioned that a guy named Elon Musk might be stopping by.\nThe amateur rocketry scene is tight, and it was Cantrell who recommended\nthat Musk check out Garvey\u2019s workshop and see Mueller\u2019s designs. On a\nSunday, Musk arrived with a pregnant Justine, wearing a stylish black\nleather trench coat and looking like a high-paid assassin. Mueller had the\neighty-pound engine on his shoulder and was trying to bolt it to a support\nstructure when Musk began peppering him with questions. \u201cHe asked me\nhow much thrust it had,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cHe wanted to know if I had ever\nworked on anything bigger. I told him that yeah, I\u2019d worked on a 650,000-\npound thrust engine at TRW and knew every part of it.\u201d Mueller set the\nengine down and tried to keep up with Musk\u2019s interrogation. \u201cHow much\nwould that big engine cost?\u201d Musk asked. Mueller told him TRW built it for\nabout $12 million. Musk shot back, \u201cYeah, but how much could you really\ndo it for?\u201d\nMueller ended up chatting with Musk for hours. The next weekend,\nMueller invited Musk to his house to continue their discussion. Musk knew\nhe had found someone who really knew the ins and outs of making rockets.\nAfter that, Musk introduced Mueller to the rest of his roundtable of space\nexperts and their stealthy meetings. The caliber of the people impressed\nMueller, who had turned down past job offers from Beal and other budding\nspace magnates because of their borderline insane ideas. Musk, by contrast,\nseemed to know what he was doing, weeding out the naysayers meeting by\nmeeting and forming a crew of bright, committed engineers.\nMueller had helped Musk fill out that spreadsheet around the\nperformance and cost metrics of a new, low-cost rocket, and, along with the\nrest of Team Musk, had subsequently refined the idea. The rocket would not\ncarry truck-sized satellites like some of the monster rockets flown by", "Boeing, Lockheed, the Russians, and others countries. Instead, Musk\u2019s\nrocket would be aimed at the lower end of the satellite market, and it could\nend up as ideal for an emerging class of smaller payloads that capitalized on\nthe massive advances that had taken place in recent years in computing and\nelectronics technology. The rocket would cater directly to a theory in the\nspace industry that a whole new market might open for both commercial\nand research payloads if a company could drastically lower the price per\nlaunch and perform launches on a regular schedule. Musk relished the idea\nof being at the forefront of this trend and developing the workhorse of a\nnew era in space. Of course, all of this was theoretical\u2014and then, suddenly,\nit wasn\u2019t. PayPal had gone public in February with its shares shooting up 55\npercent, and Musk knew that eBay wanted to buy the company as well.\nWhile noodling on the rocket idea, Musk\u2019s net worth had increased from\ntens of millions to hundreds of millions. In April 2002, Musk fully\nabandoned the publicity-stunt idea and committed to building a commercial\nspace venture. He pulled aside Cantrell, Griffin, Mueller, and Chris\nThompson, an aerospace engineer at Boeing, and told the group, \u201cI want to\ndo this company. If you guys are in, let\u2019s do it.\u201d (Griffin wanted to join but\nended up declining when Musk rebuffed his request to live on the East\nCoast, and Cantrell only stuck around for a few months after this meeting,\nseeing the venture as too risky.)\nFounded in June 2002, Space Exploration Technologies came to life in\nhumble settings. Musk acquired an old warehouse at 1310 East Grand\nAvenue in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles humming with the activity\nof the aerospace industry. The previous tenant of the 75,000-square-foot\nbuilding had done lots of shipping and had used the south side of the facility\nas a logistics depot, outfitting it with several receiving bays for delivery\ntrucks. This allowed Musk to drive his silver McLaren right into the\nbuilding. Beyond that the surroundings were sparse\u2014just a dusty floor and\na forty-foot-high ceiling with its wooden beams and insulation exposed and\nwhich curved at the top to give the place a hangarlike feel. The north side of\nthe building was an office space with cubicles and room for about fifty\npeople. During the first week of SpaceX\u2019s operations, delivery trucks\nshowed up packed full of Dell laptops and printers and folding tables that\nwould serve as the first desks. Musk walked over to one of the loading\ndocks, rolled up the door, and off-loaded the equipment himself.", "Musk had soon transformed the SpaceX office with what has become\nhis signature factory aesthetic: a glossy epoxy coating applied over concrete\non the floors, and a fresh coat of white paint slathered onto the walls. The\nwhite color scheme was intended to make the factory look clean and feel\ncheerful. Desks were interspersed around the factory so that Ivy League\ncomputer scientists and engineers designing the machines could sit with the\nwelders and machinists building the hardware. This approach stood as\nSpaceX\u2019s first major break with traditional aerospace companies that prefer\nto cordon different engineering groups off from each other and typically\nseparate engineers and machinists by thousands of miles by placing their\nfactories in locations where real estate and labor run cheap.\nAs the first dozen or so employees came to the offices, they were told\nthat SpaceX\u2019s mission would be to emerge as the \u201cSouthwest Airlines of\nSpace.\u201d SpaceX would build its own engines and then contract with\nsuppliers for the other components of the rocket. The company would gain\nan edge over the competition by building a better, cheaper engine and by\nfine-tuning the assembly process to make rockets faster and cheaper than\nanyone else. This vision included the construction of a type of mobile\nlaunch vehicle that could travel to various sites, take the rocket from a\nhorizontal to vertical position, and send it off to space\u2014no muss, no fuss.\nSpaceX was meant to get so good at this process that it could do multiple\nlaunches a month, make money off each one, and never need to become a\nhuge contractor dependent on government funds.\nSpaceX was to be America\u2019s attempt at a clean slate in the rocket\nbusiness, a modernized reset. Musk felt that the space industry had not\nreally evolved in about fifty years. The aerospace companies had little\ncompetition and tended to make supremely expensive products that\nachieved maximum performance. They were building a Ferrari for every\nlaunch, when it was possible that a Honda Accord might do the trick. Musk,\nby contrast, would apply some of the start-up techniques he\u2019d learned in\nSilicon Valley to run SpaceX lean and fast and capitalize on the huge\nadvances in computing power and materials that had taken place over the\npast couple of decades. As a private company, SpaceX would also avoid the\nwaste and cost overruns associated with government contractors. Musk\ndeclared that SpaceX\u2019s first rocket would be called the Falcon 1, a nod to\nStar Wars\u2019 Millennium Falcon and his role as the architect of an exciting\nfuture. At a time when the cost of sending a 550-pound payload started at", "$30 million, he promised that the Falcon 1 would be able to carry a 1,400-\npound payload for $6.9 million.\nBowing to his nature, Musk set an insanely ambitious timeline for all of\nthis. One of the earliest SpaceX presentations suggested that the company\nwould complete its first engine in May 2003, a second engine in June, the\nbody of the rocket in July, and have everything assembled in August. A\nlaunchpad would then be prepared by September, and the first launch would\ntake place in November 2003, or about fifteen months after the company\nstarted. A trip to Mars was naturally slated for somewhere near the end of\nthe decade. This was Musk the logical, na\u00efve optimist tabulating how long it\nshould take people physically to perform all of this work. It\u2019s the baseline\nhe expects of himself and one that his employees, with their human foibles,\nare in a never-ending struggle to match.\nAs space enthusiasts started to learn about the new company, they didn\u2019t\nreally obsess over whether Musk\u2019s delivery schedule sounded realistic or\nnot. They were just thrilled that someone had decided to take the cheap and\nfast approach. Some members of the military had already been promoting\nthe idea of giving the armed forces more aggressive space capabilities, or\nwhat they called \u201cresponsive space.\u201d If a conflict broke out, the military\nwanted the ability to respond with purpose-built satellites for that mission.\nThis would mean moving away from a model where it takes ten years to\nbuild and deploy a satellite for a specific job. Instead, the military desired\ncheaper, smaller satellites that could be reconfigured through software and\nsent up on short notice, almost like disposable satellites. \u201cIf we could pull\nthat off, it would be really game-changing,\u201d said Pete Worden, a retired air\nforce general, who met with Musk while serving as a consultant to the\nDefense Department. \u201cIt could make our response in space similar to what\nwe do on land, sea and in the air.\u201d Worden\u2019s job required him to look at\nradical technologies. While many of the people he encountered came off as\neccentric dreamers, Musk seemed grounded, knowledgeable, and capable.\n\u201cI talked to people building ray guns and things in their garages. It was\nclear that Elon was different. He was a visionary who really understood the\nrocket technology, and I was impressed with him.\u201d\nLike the military, scientists wanted cheap, quick access to space and the\nability to send up experiments and get data back on a regular basis. Some\ncompanies in the medical and consumer-goods industries were also", "interested in rides to space to study how a lack of gravity affected the\nproperties of their products.\nAs good as a cheap launch vehicle sounded, the odds of a private citizen\nbuilding one that worked were beyond remote. A quick search on YouTube\nfor \u201crocket explosions\u201d turns up thousands of compilation videos\ndocumenting U.S. and Soviet launch disasters that have occurred over the\ndecades. From 1957 to 1966, the United States alone tried to blast more\nthan 400 rockets into orbit and about 100 of them crashed and burned.5 The\nrockets used to transport things to space are mostly modified missiles\ndeveloped through all of this trial and error and funded by billions upon\nbillions of government dollars. SpaceX had the advantage of being able to\nlearn from this past work and having a few people on staff that had\noverseen rocket projects at companies like Boeing and TRW. That said, the\nstart-up did not have a budget that could support a string of explosions. At\nbest, SpaceX would have three or four shots at making the Falcon 1 work.\n\u201cPeople thought we were just crazy,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cAt TRW, I had an army\nof people and government funding. Now we were going to make a low-cost\nrocket from scratch with a small team. People just didn\u2019t think it could be\ndone.\u201d\nIn July 2002, Musk was gripped by the excitement of this daring\nenterprise, and eBay made its aggressive move to buy PayPal for $1.5\nbillion. This deal gave Musk some liquidity and supplied him with more\nthan $100 million to throw at SpaceX. With such a massive up-front\ninvestment, no one would be able to wrestle control of SpaceX away from\nMusk as they had done at Zip2 and PayPal. For the employees who had\nagreed to accompany Musk on this seemingly impossible journey, the\nwindfall provided at least a couple of years of job security. The acquisition\nalso upped Musk\u2019s profile and celebrity, which he could leverage to score\nmeetings with top government officials and to sway suppliers.\nAnd then all of a sudden none of this seemed to matter. Justine had\ngiven birth to a son\u2014Nevada Alexander Musk. He was ten weeks old\nwhen, just as the eBay deal was announced, he died. The Musks had tucked\nNevada in for a nap and placed the boy on his back as parents are taught to\ndo. When they returned to check on him, he was no longer breathing and\nhad suffered from what the doctors would term a sudden infant death\nsyndrome\u2013related incident. \u201cBy the time the paramedics resuscitated him,\nhe had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead,\u201d Justine", "wrote in her article for Marie Claire. \u201cHe spent three days on life support in\na hospital in Orange County before we made the decision to take him off it.\nI held him in my arms when he died. Elon made it clear that he did not want\nto talk about Nevada\u2019s death. I didn\u2019t understand this, just as he didn\u2019t\nunderstand why I grieved openly, which he regarded as \u2018emotionally\nmanipulative.\u2019 I buried my feelings instead, coping with Nevada\u2019s death by\nmaking my first visit to an IVF clinic less than two months later. Elon and I\nplanned to get pregnant again as swiftly as possible. Within the next five\nyears, I gave birth to twins, then triplets.\u201d Later, Justine chalked up Musk\u2019s\nreaction to a defense mechanism that he\u2019d learned from years of suffering\nas a kid. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do well in dark places,\u201d she told Esquire magazine.\n\u201cHe\u2019s forward-moving, and I think it\u2019s a survival thing with him.\u201d\nMusk did open up to a couple of close friends and expressed the depth\nof his misery. But for the most part, Justine read her husband right. He\ndidn\u2019t see the value in grieving publicly. \u201cIt made me extremely sad to talk\nabout it,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019d want to talk about extremely\nsad events. It does no good for the future. If you\u2019ve got other kids and\nobligations, then wallowing in sadness does no good for anyone around\nyou. I\u2019m not sure what should be done in such situations.\u201d\nFollowing Nevada\u2019s death, Musk threw himself at SpaceX and rapidly\nexpanded the company\u2019s goals. His conversations with aerospace\ncontractors around possible work for SpaceX left Musk disenchanted. It\nsounded like they all charged a lot of money and worked slowly. The plan\nto integrate components made by these types of companies gave way to the\ndecision to make as much as practical right at SpaceX. \u201cWhile drawing\nupon the ideas of many prior launch vehicle programs from Apollo to the\nX-34/Fastrac, SpaceX is privately developing the entire Falcon rocket from\nthe ground up, including both engines, the turbo-pump, the cryogenic tank\nstructure and the guidance system,\u201d the company announced on its website.\n\u201cA ground up internal development increases difficulty and the required\ninvestment, but no other path will achieve the needed improvement in the\ncost of access to space.\u201d\nThe SpaceX executives Musk hired were an all-star crew. Mueller set to\nwork right away building the two engines\u2014Merlin and Kestrel, named after\ntwo types of falcons. Chris Thompson, a onetime marine who had managed\nthe production of the Delta and Titan rockets at Boeing, joined as the vice\npresident of operations. Tim Buzza also came from Boeing, where he\u2019d", "earned a reputation as one of the world\u2019s leading rocket testers. Steve\nJohnson, who had worked at JPL and at two commercial space companies,\nwas tapped as the senior mechanical engineer. The aerospace engineer Hans\nKoenigsmann came on to develop the avionics, guidance, and control\nsystems. Musk also recruited Gwynne Shotwell, an aerospace veteran who\nstarted as SpaceX\u2019s first salesperson and rose in the years that followed to\nbe president and Musk\u2019s right-hand woman.\nThese early days also marked the arrival of Mary Beth Brown, a now-\nlegendary character in the lore of both SpaceX and Tesla. Brown\u2014or MB,\nas everyone called her\u2014became Musk\u2019s loyal assistant, establishing a real-\nlife version of the relationship between Iron Man\u2019s Tony Stark and Pepper\nPotts. If Musk worked a twenty-hour day, so too did Brown. Over the years,\nshe brought Musk meals, set up his business appointments, arranged time\nwith his children, picked out his clothes, dealt with press requests, and\nwhen necessary yanked Musk out of meetings to keep him on schedule. She\nwould emerge as the only bridge between Musk and all of his interests and\nwas an invaluable asset to the companies\u2019 employees.\nBrown played a key role in developing SpaceX\u2019s early culture. She paid\nattention to small details like the office\u2019s red spaceship trash cans and\nhelped balance the vibe around the office. When it came to matters related\ndirectly to Musk, Brown put on her firm countenance and no-nonsense\nattitude. The rest of the time she usually had a warm, broad smile and a\ndisarming charm. \u201cIt was always, \u2018Oh, dear. How are you, dear?\u2019\u201d recalled\na SpaceX technician. Brown collected the weird e-mails that arrived for\nMusk and sent them out as \u201cKook of the Week\u201d missives to make people\nlaugh. One of the better entries included a pencil sketch of a lunar\nspacecraft that had a red spot on the page. The person who sent in the letter\nhad circled the spot on his own drawing and then written \u201cWhat is that?\nBlood?\u201d next to it. In other letters there were plans for a perpetual motion\nmachine and a proposal for a giant inflatable rabbit that could be used to\nplug oil spills. For a short time, Brown\u2019s duties extended to managing\nSpaceX\u2019s books and handling the flow of business in Musk\u2019s absence. \u201cShe\npretty much called the shots,\u201d the technician said. \u201cShe would say, \u2018This is\nwhat Elon would want.\u2019\u201d\nHer greatest gift, though, may have been reading Musk\u2019s moods. At\nboth SpaceX and Tesla, Brown placed her desk a few feet in front of\nMusk\u2019s, so that people had to pass her before having a meeting with him. If", "someone needed to request permission to buy a big-ticket item, they would\nstop for a moment in front of Brown and wait for a nod to go see Musk or\nthe shake-off to go away because Musk was having a bad day. This system\nof nods and shakes became particularly important during periods of\nromantic strife for Musk, when his nerves were on edge more than usual.\nThe rank-and-file engineers at SpaceX tended to be young, male\noverachievers. Musk would personally reach out to the aerospace\ndepartments of top colleges and inquire about the students who had finished\nwith the best marks on their exams. It was not unusual for him to call the\nstudents in their dorm rooms and recruit them over the phone. \u201cI thought it\nwas a prank call,\u201d said Michael Colonno, who heard from Musk while\nattending Stanford. \u201cI did not believe for a minute that he had a rocket\ncompany.\u201d Once the students looked Musk up on the Internet, selling them\non SpaceX was easy. For the first time in years if not decades, young\naeronautics whizzes who pined to explore space had a really exciting\ncompany to latch on to and a path toward designing a rocket or even\nbecoming an astronaut that did not require them to join a bureaucratic\ngovernment contractor. As word of SpaceX\u2019s ambitions spread, top\nengineers from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital Sciences with a high\ntolerance for risk fled to the upstart, too.\nThroughout the first year at SpaceX, one or two new employees joined\nalmost every week. Kevin Brogan was employee No. 23 and came from\nTRW, where he\u2019d been used to various internal policies blocking him from\ndoing work. \u201cI called it the country club,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody did anything.\u201d\nBrogan started at SpaceX the day after his interview and was told to go\nhunting in the office for a computer to use. \u201cIt was go to Fry\u2019s and get\nwhatever you need and go to Staples and get a chair,\u201d Brogan said. He\nimmediately felt in over his head and would work for twelve hours, drive\nhome, sleep for ten hours, and then head right back to the factory. \u201cI was\nexhausted and out of shape mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cBut soon I loved it and got\ntotally hooked.\u201d\nOne of the first projects SpaceX decided to tackle was the construction\nof a gas generator, a machine not unlike a small rocket engine that produces\nhot gas. Mueller, Buzza, and a couple of young engineers assembled the\ngenerator in Los Angeles and then packed it into the back of a pickup truck\nand drove it out to Mojave, California, to test it. A desert town about one\nhundred miles from Los Angeles, Mojave had become a hub for aerospace", "companies like Scaled Composites and XCOR. A lot of the aerospace\nprojects were based out of the Mojave airport, where companies had their\nworkshops and sent up all manner of cutting-edge airplanes and rockets.\nThe SpaceX team fit right into this environment and borrowed a test stand\nfrom XCOR that was just about the perfect size to hold the gas generator.\nThe first ignition run took place at 11 A.M. and lasted ninety seconds. The\ngas generator worked, but it had let out a billowing black smoke cloud that\non this windless day parked right over the airport tower. The airport\nmanager came down to the test area and lit into Mueller and Buzza. The\nairport official and some of the guys from XCOR who had been helping out\nurged the SpaceX engineers to take it easy and wait until the next day to run\nanother test. Instead, Buzza a strong leader ready to put SpaceX\u2019s relentless\nethos into play, coordinated a couple of trucks to pick up more fuel, talked\nthe airport manager down, and got the test stand ready for another fire. In\nthe days that followed, SpaceX\u2019s engineers perfected a routine that let them\ndo multiple tests a day\u2014an unheard-of practice at the airport\u2014and had the\ngas generator tuned to their liking after two weeks of work.\nThey made a few more trips to Mojave and some other spots, including\na test stand at Edwards Air Force Base and another in Mississippi. While on\nthis countrywide rocketry tour, the SpaceX engineers came across a three-\nhundred-acre test site in McGregor, Texas, a small city near the center of\nthe state. They really liked this spot, and talked Musk into buying it. The\nnavy had tested rockets on the land years before and so too had Andrew\nBeal before his aerospace company collapsed. \u201cAfter Beal saw it was going\nto cost him $300 million to develop a rocket capable of sending sizeable\nsatellites into orbit, he called it quits, leaving behind a lot of useful\ninfrastructure for SpaceX, including a three-story concrete tripod with legs\nas big around as redwood tree trunks,\u201d wrote journalist Michael Belfiore in\nRocketeers, a book that captured the rise of a handful of private space\ncompanies.\nJeremy Hollman was one of the young engineers who soon found\nhimself living in Texas and customizing the test site to SpaceX\u2019s needs.\nHollman exemplified the kind of recruit Musk wanted: he\u2019d earned an\naerospace engineering degree from Iowa State University and a master\u2019s in\nastronautical engineering from the University of Southern California. He\u2019d\nspent a couple of years working as a test engineer at Boeing dealing with\njets, rockets, and spacecraft.*", "The stint at Boeing had left Hollman unimpressed with big aerospace.\nHis first day on the job came right as Boeing completed its merger with\nMcDonnell Douglas. The resultant mammoth government contractor held a\npicnic to boost morale but ended up failing at even this simple exercise.\n\u201cThe head of one of the departments gave a speech about it being one\ncompany with one vision and then added that the company was very cost\nconstrained,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cHe asked that everyone limit themselves to\none piece of chicken.\u201d Things didn\u2019t improve much from there. Every\nproject at Boeing felt large, cumbersome, and costly. So, when Musk came\nalong selling radical change, Hollman bit. \u201cI thought it was an opportunity I\ncould not pass up,\u201d he said. At twenty-three, Hollman was young, single,\nand willing to give up any semblance of having a life in favor of working at\nSpaceX nonstop, and he became Mueller\u2019s second in command.\nMueller had developed a pair of three-dimensional computer models of\nthe two engines he wanted to build. Merlin would be the engine for the first\nstage of the Falcon 1, which lifted it off the ground, and Kestrel would be\nthe smaller engine used to power the upper, second stage of the rocket and\nguide it in space. Together, Hollman and Mueller figured out which parts of\nthe engines SpaceX would build at the factory and which parts it would try\nto buy. For the purchased parts, Hollman had to head out to various\nmachine shops and get quotes and delivery dates for the hardware. Quite\noften, the machinists told Hollman that SpaceX\u2019s timelines were nuts.\nOthers were more accommodating and would try to bend an existing\nproduct to SpaceX\u2019s needs instead of building something from scratch.\nHollman also found that creativity got him a long way. He discovered, for\nexample, that changing the seals on some readily available car wash valves\nmade them good enough to be used with rocket fuel.\nAfter SpaceX completed its first engine at the factory in California,\nHollman loaded it and mounds of other equipment into a U-Haul trailer. He\nhitched the U-Haul to the back of a white Hummer H2 and drove four\nthousand pounds of gear* across Interstate 10 from Los Angeles to Texas\nand the test site. The arrival of the engine in Texas kicked off one of the\ngreat bonding exercises in SpaceX\u2019s history. Amid rattlesnakes, fire ants,\nisolation, and searing heat, the group led by Buzza and Mueller began the\nprocess of exploring every intricacy of the engines. It was a high-pressure\nslog full of explosions\u2014or what the engineers politely called \u201crapid\nunscheduled disassemblies\u201d\u2014that would determine whether a small band of", "engineers really could match the effort and skill of nation-states. The\nSpaceX employees christened the site in fitting fashion, downing a $1,200\nbottle of R\u00e9my Martin cognac out of paper cups and passing a sobriety test\non the drive back to the company apartments in the Hummer. From that\npoint on, the trek from California to the test site became known as the Texas\nCattle Haul. The SpaceX engineers would work for ten days straight, come\nback to California for a weekend, and then head back. To ease the burden of\ntravel, Musk sometimes let them use his private jet. \u201cIt carried six people,\u201d\nMueller said. \u201cWell, seven if someone sat in the toilet, which happened all\nthe time.\u201d\nWhile the navy and Beal had left some testing apparatus, SpaceX had to\nbuild a large amount of custom gear. One of the largest of these structures\nwas a horizontal test stand about 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 15 feet tall.\nThen there was the complementary vertical test stand that stood two stories\nhigh. When an engine needed to be fired, it would be fastened to one of the\ntest stands, outfitted with sensors to collect data, and monitored via several\ncameras. The engineers took shelter in a bunker protected on one side by a\ndirt embankment. If something went wrong, they would look at feeds from\nthe webcams or slowly lift one of the bunker\u2019s hatches to listen for any\nclues. The locals in town rarely complained about the noise, although the\nanimals on nearby farms seemed less impressed. \u201cCows have this natural\ndefense mechanism where they gather and start running in a circle,\u201d\nHollman said. \u201cEvery time we fired an engine, the cows scattered and then\ngot in that circle with the younger ones placed in the middle. We set up a\ncow cam to watch them.\u201d\nBoth Kestrel and Merlin came with challenges, and they were treated as\nalternating engineering exercises. \u201cWe would run Merlin until we ran out of\nhardware or did something bad,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cThen we\u2019d run Kestrel and\nthere was never a shortage of things to do.\u201d For months, the SpaceX\nengineers arrived at the site at 8 A.M. and spent twelve hours there working\non the engines before retiring to the Outback Steakhouse for dinner. Mueller\nhad a particular knack for looking over test data and spotting some place\nwhere the engine ran hot or cold or had another flaw. He would call\nCalifornia and prescribe hardware changes, and engineers would refashion\nparts and send them off to Texas. Often the workers in Texas modified parts\nthemselves using a mill and lathe that Mueller had brought out. \u201cKestrel\nstarted out as a real dog, and one of my proudest moments was taking it", "from terrible to great performance with stuff we bought online and did in\nthe machine shop,\u201d Mueller said. Some members of the Texas crew honed\ntheir skills to the point that they could build a test-worthy engine in three\ndays. These same people were required to be adept at software. They\u2019d pull\nan all-nighter building a turbo pump for the engine and then dig in the next\nnight to retool a suite of applications used to control the engines. Hollman\ndid this type of work all the time and was an all-star, but he was not alone\namong this group of young, nimble engineers who crossed disciplines out of\nnecessity and the spirit of adventure. \u201cThere was an almost addictive quality\nto the experience,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cYou\u2019re twenty-four or twenty-five, and\nthey\u2019re trusting you with so much. It was very empowering.\u201d\nTo get to space, the Merlin engine would need to burn for 180 seconds.\nThat seemed like an eternity for the engineers at the outset of their stint in\nTexas, when the engine would burn for only a half second before it conked\nout. Sometimes Merlin vibrated too much during the tests. Sometimes it\nresponded badly to a new material. Sometimes it cracked and needed major\npart upgrades, like moving from an aluminum manifold to a manifold made\nout of the more exotic Inconel, an alloy suited to extreme temperatures. On\none occasion, a fuel valve refused to open properly and caused the whole\nengine to blow up. Another test gone wrong ended up with the whole test\nstand burning down. It usually came to Buzza and Mueller to make the\nunpleasant call back to Musk and recap the day\u2019s foibles. \u201cElon had pretty\ngood patience,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cI remember one time we had two test stands\nrunning and blew up two things in one day. I told Elon we could put another\nengine on there, but I was really, really frustrated and just tired and mad and\nwas kinda short with Elon. I said, \u2018We can put another fucking thing on\nthere, but I\u2019ve blown up enough shit today.\u2019 He said, \u2018Okay, all right, that\u2019s\nfine. Just calm down. We\u2019ll do it again tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Coworkers in El\nSegundo later reported that Musk had been near tears during this call after\nhearing the frustration and agony in Mueller\u2019s voice.\nWhat Musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan\nof attack. Hollman was one of many engineers who arrived at this\nrealization after facing one of Musk\u2019s trademark grillings. \u201cThe worst call\nwas the first one,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cSomething had gone wrong, and Elon\nasked me how long it would take to be operational again, and I didn\u2019t have\nan immediate answer. He said, \u2018You need to. This is important to the\ncompany. Everything is riding on this. Why don\u2019t you have an answer?\u2019 He", "kept hitting me with pointed, direct questions. I thought it was more\nimportant to let him know quickly what happened, but I learned it was more\nimportant to have all the information.\u201d\nFrom time to time, Musk participated in the testing process firsthand.\nOne of the more memorable examples of this came as SpaceX tried to\nperfect a cooling chamber for its engines. The company had bought several\nof these chambers at $75,000 a pop and needed to put them under pressure\nwith water to gauge their ability to handle stress. During the initial test, one\nof the pricey chambers cracked. Then the second one broke in the same\nplace. Musk ordered a third test, as the engineers looked on in horror. They\nthought the test might be putting the chamber under undue stress and that\nMusk was burning through essential equipment. When the third chamber\ncracked, Musk flew the hardware back to California, took it to the factory\nfloor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the chambers with\nan epoxy to see if it would seal them. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to get his hands\ndirty,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cHe\u2019s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes\nand has epoxy all over him. They were there all night and tested it again and\nit broke anyway.\u201d Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the hardware was\nflawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly, asking the engineers to\ncome up with a new solution.\nThese incidents were all part of a trying but productive process. SpaceX\nhad developed the feeling of a small, tight-knit family up against the world.\nIn late 2002, the company had an empty warehouse. One year later, the\nfacility looked like a real rocket factory. Working Merlin engines were\narriving back from Texas, and being fed into an assembly line where\nmachinists could connect them to the main body, or first stage, of the\nrocket. More stations were set up to link the first stage with the upper stage\nof the rocket. Cranes were placed on the floor to handle the heavy lifting of\ncomponents, and blue metal transport tracks were positioned to guide the\nrocket\u2019s body through the factory from station to station. SpaceX had also\nstarted to build the fairing, or case, that protects payloads atop the rocket\nduring launch and then opens up like a clam in space to let out the cargo.\nSpaceX had picked up a customer as well. According to Musk, its first\nrocket would launch in \u201cearly 2004\u201d from Vandenberg Air Force Base,\ncarrying a satellite called TacSat-1 for the Department of Defense. With this\ngoal looming, twelve-hour days, six days a week were considered the norm,\nalthough many people worked longer than that for extended periods of time.", "Respites, as far as they existed, came around 8 P.M. on some weeknights\nwhen Musk would allow everyone to use their work computers to play first-\nperson-shooter video games like Quake III Arena and Counter-Strike\nagainst each other. At the appointed hour, the sound of guns loading would\ncascade throughout the office as close to twenty people armed themselves\nfor battle. Musk\u2014playing under the handle Random9\u2014often won the\ngames, talking trash and blasting away his employees without mercy. \u201cThe\nCEO is there shooting at us with rockets and plasma guns,\u201d said Colonno.\n\u201cWorse, he\u2019s almost alarmingly good at these games and has insanely fast\nreactions. He knew all the tricks and how to sneak up on people.\u201d\nThe pending launch ignited Musk\u2019s salesman instincts. He wanted to\nshow the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up\nsome excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to unveil a prototype of\nFalcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the\nseven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and\nleave it\u2014and the SpaceX mobile launch system\u2014outside of the Federal\nAviation Administration\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C. An\naccompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a\nmodern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.\nThis marketing song and dance didn\u2019t sound sensible to SpaceX\u2019s\nengineers. They were working more than one hundred hours per week to\nmake the actual rocket that SpaceX would need to be in business. Musk\nwanted them to do that and build a slick-looking mock-up. Engineers were\ncalled back from Texas and assigned another ulcer-inducing deadline to\ncraft this prop. \u201cIn my mind, it was a boondoggle,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nadvancing anything. In Elon\u2019s mind, it would get us a lot of backing from\nimportant people in the government.\u201d\nWhile making the prototype for the event, Hollman experienced the full\nspectrum of highs and lows that came with working for Musk. The engineer\nhad lost his regular glasses weeks earlier when they slipped off his face and\nfell down a flame duct at the Texas test site. Hollman had since made do by\nwearing an old pair of prescription safety glasses,* but they too were ruined\nwhen he scratched the lenses while trying to duck under an engine at the\nSpaceX factory. Without a spare moment to visit an optometrist, Hollman\nstarted to feel his sanity fray. The long hours, the scratch, the publicity stunt\n\u2014they were all too much.", "He vented about this in the factory one night, unaware that Musk stood\nnearby and could hear everything. Two hours later, Mary Beth Brown\nappeared with an appointment card to see a Lasik eye surgery specialist.\nWhen Hollman visited the doctor, he discovered that Musk had already\nagreed to pay for the surgery. \u201cElon can be very demanding, but he\u2019ll make\nsure the obstacles in your way are removed,\u201d Hollman said. Upon\nreflection, he also warmed to the long-term thinking behind Musk\u2019s\nWashington plan. \u201cI think he wanted to add an element of realism to\nSpaceX, and if you park a rocket in someone\u2019s front yard, it\u2019s hard to deny\nit,\u201d Hollman said.\nThe event in Washington ended up being well received, and just a few\nweeks after it took place, SpaceX made another astonishing announcement.\nDespite not having even flown a rocket yet, SpaceX revealed plans for a\nsecond rocket. Along with the Falcon 1, it would build the Falcon 5. Per the\nname, this rocket would have five engines and could carry more weight\u2014\n9,200 pounds\u2014to low orbit around Earth. Crucially, the Falcon 5 could also\ntheoretically reach the International Space Station for resupply missions\u2014a\ncapability that would open up SpaceX for some large NASA contracts. And,\nin a nod to Musk\u2019s obsession with safety, the rocket was said to be able to\ncomplete its missions even if three of the five engines failed, which was a\nlevel of added reliability that had not been seen in the market in decades.\nThe only way to keep up with all of this work was to do what SpaceX\nhad promised from the beginning: operate in the spirit of a Silicon Valley\nstart-up. Musk was always looking for brainy engineers who had not just\ndone well at school but had done something exceptional with their talents.\nWhen he found someone good, Musk was relentless in courting him or her\nto come to SpaceX. Bryan Gardner, for example, first met Musk at a space\nrave in the hangars at the Mojave airport and a short while later started\ntalking about a job. Gardner was having some of his academic work\nsponsored by Northrop Grumman. \u201cElon said, \u2018We\u2019ll buy them out,\u2019\u201d\nGardner said. \u201cSo, I e-mailed him my resume at two thirty A.M., and he\nreplied back in thirty minutes addressing everything I put in there point by\npoint. He said, \u2018When you interview make sure you can talk concretely\nabout what you do rather than use buzzwords.\u2019 It floored me that he would\ntake the time to do this.\u201d After being hired, Gardner was tasked with\nimproving the system for testing the valves on the Merlin engine. There\nwere dozens of valves, and it took three to five hours to manually test each", "one. Six months later, Gardner had built an automated system for testing the\nvalves in minutes. The testing machine tracked the valves individually, so\nthat an engineer in Texas could request what the metrics had been on a\nspecific part. \u201cI had been handed this redheaded stepchild that no one else\nwanted to deal with and established my engineering credibility,\u201d Gardner\nsaid.\nAs the new hires arrived, SpaceX moved beyond its original building to\nfill up several buildings in the El Segundo complex. The engineers were\nrunning demanding software and rendering large graphics files and needed\nhigh-speed connections between all of these offices. But SpaceX had\nneighbors who were blocking an initiative to connect all of its buildings via\nfiber optic lines. Instead of taking the time to haggle with the other\ncompanies for right of way, the IT chief Branden Spikes, who had worked\nwith Musk at Zip2 and PayPal, came up with a quicker, more devious\nsolution. A friend of his worked for the phone company and drew a diagram\nthat demonstrated a way to squeeze a networking cable safely between the\nelectricity, cable, and phone wires on a telephone pole. At 2 A.M., an off-the-\nbooks crew showed up with a cherry picker and ran fiber to the telephone\npoles and then ran cables straight to the SpaceX buildings. \u201cWe did that\nover a weekend instead of taking months to get permits,\u201d Spikes said.\n\u201cThere was always this feeling that we were facing a sort of insurmountable\nchallenge and that we had to band together to fight the good fight.\u201d\nSpaceX\u2019s landlord, Alex Lidow, chuckled when thinking back to all of the\nantics of Musk\u2019s team. \u201cI know they did a lot of hanky stuff at night,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThey were smart, needed to get things done, and didn\u2019t always have\ntime to wait for things like city permits.\u201d\nMusk never relented in asking his employees to do more and be better,\nwhether it was at the office or during extracurricular activities. Part of\nSpikes\u2019s duties included building custom gaming PCs for Musk\u2019s home that\npushed their computational power to the limits and needed to be cooled\nwith water running through a series of tubes inside the machines. When one\nof these gaming rigs kept breaking, Spikes figured out that Musk\u2019s mansion\nhad dirty power lines and had a second, dedicated power circuit built for the\ngaming room to correct the problem. Doing this favor bought Spikes no\nspecial treatment. \u201cSpaceX\u2019s mail server crashed one time, and Elon word\nfor word said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever fucking let that happen again,\u2019\u201d Spikes said. \u201cHe", "had a way of looking at you\u2014a glare\u2014and would keep looking at you until\nyou understood him.\u201d\nMusk had tried to find contractors that could keep up with SpaceX\u2019s\ncreativity and pace. Instead of always hitting up aerospace guys, for\nexample, he located suppliers with similar experience from different fields.\nEarly on, SpaceX needed someone to build the fuel tanks, essentially the\nmain body of the rocket, and Musk ended up in the Midwest talking to\ncompanies that had made large, metal agricultural tanks used in the dairy\nand food processing businesses. These suppliers also struggled to keep up\nwith SpaceX\u2019s schedule, and Musk found himself flying across the country\nto pay visits\u2014sometimes surprise ones\u2014on the contractors to check on\ntheir progress. One such inspection took place at a company in Wisconsin\ncalled Spincraft. Musk and a couple of SpaceX employees flew his jet\nacross the country and arrived late at night expecting to see a shift of\nworkers doing extra duty to get the fuel tanks completed. When Musk\ndiscovered that Spincraft was well behind schedule, he turned to a Spincraft\nemployee and informed him, \u201cYou\u2019re fucking us up the ass, and it doesn\u2019t\nfeel good.\u201d David Schmitz was a general manager at Spincraft and said\nMusk earned a reputation as a fearsome negotiator who did indeed follow\nup on things personally. \u201cIf Elon was not happy, you knew it,\u201d Schmitz said.\n\u201cThings could get nasty.\u201d In the months that followed that meeting, SpaceX\nincreased its internal welding capabilities so that it could make the fuel\ntanks in El Segundo and ditch Spincraft.\nAnother salesman flew down to SpaceX to sell the company on some\ntechnology infrastructure equipment. He was doing the standard\nrelationship-building exercise practiced by salespeople for centuries. Show\nup. Speak for a while. Feel each other out. Then, start doing business down\nthe road. Musk was having none of it. \u201cThe guy comes in, and Elon asks\nhim why they\u2019re meeting,\u201d Spikes said. \u201cHe said, \u2018To develop a\nrelationship.\u2019 Elon replied, \u2018Okay. Nice to meet you,\u2019 which basically\nmeant, \u2018Get the fuck out of my office.\u2019 This guy had spent four hours\ntraveling for what ended up as a two-minute meeting. Elon just has no\ntolerance for that kind of stuff.\u201d Musk could be equally brisk with\nemployees who were not hitting his standards. \u201cHe would often say, \u2018The\nlonger you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should\nhave fired them,\u2019\u201d Spikes said.", "Most of the SpaceX employees were thrilled to be part of the company\u2019s\nadventure and tried not to let Musk\u2019s grueling demands and harsh behavior\nget to them. But there were some moments where Musk went too far. The\nengineering corps flew into a collective rage every time they caught Musk\nin the press claiming to have designed the Falcon rocket more or less by\nhimself. Musk also hired a documentary crew to follow him around for a\nwhile. This audacious gesture really grated on the people toiling away in the\nSpaceX factory. They felt like Musk\u2019s ego had gotten the best of him and\nthat he was presenting SpaceX as the conqueror of the aerospace industry\nwhen the company had yet to launch successfully. Employees who made\ndetailed cases around what they saw as flaws in the Falcon 5 design or\npresented practical suggestions to get the Falcon 1 out the door more\nquickly were often ignored or worse. \u201cThe treatment of staff was not good\nfor long stretches of this era,\u201d said one engineer. \u201cMany good engineers,\nwho everyone beside \u2018management\u2019 felt were assets to the company, were\nforced out or simply fired outright after being blamed for things they hadn\u2019t\ndone. The kiss of death was proving Elon wrong about something.\u201d\nEarly 2004, when SpaceX had hoped to launch its rocket, came and\nwent. The Merlin engine that Mueller and his team had built appeared to be\namong the most efficient rocket engines ever made. It was just taking longer\nthan Musk had expected to pass tests needed to clear the engine for a\nlaunch. Finally, in the fall of 2004, the engines were burning consistently\nand meeting all their requirements. This meant that Mueller and his team\ncould breathe easy and that everyone else at SpaceX should prepare to\nsuffer. Mueller had spent SpaceX\u2019s entire existence as the \u201ccritical path\u201d\u2014\nthe person holding up the company from achieving its next steps\u2014working\nunder Musk\u2019s scrutiny. \u201cWith the engine ready, it was time for mass panic,\u201d\nMueller said. \u201cNo one else knew what it was like to be on critical path.\u201d\nLots of people soon found out, as major problems abounded. The\navionics, which included the electronics for the navigation, communication,\nand overall management of the rocket, turned into a nightmare. Seemingly\ntrivial things like getting a flash storage drive to talk to the rocket\u2019s main\ncomputer failed for undetectable reasons. The software needed to manage\nthe rocket also became a major burden. \u201cIt\u2019s like anything else where you\nfind out that the last ten percent is where all the integration happens and\nthings don\u2019t play together,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cThis process went on for six\nmonths.\u201d Finally, in May 2005, SpaceX transported the rocket 180 miles", "north to Vandenberg Air Force Base for a test fire and completed a five-\nsecond burn on the launchpad.\nLaunching from Vandenberg would have been very convenient for\nSpaceX. The site is close to Los Angeles and has several launchpads to pick\nfrom. SpaceX, though, became an unwelcome guest. The air force gave the\nnewcomer a cool welcome, and the people assigned to manage the launch\nsites did not go out of their way help SpaceX. Lockheed and Boeing, which\nfly $1 billion spy satellites for the military from Vandenberg, didn\u2019t care for\nSpaceX\u2019s presence, either\u2014in part because SpaceX represented a threat to\ntheir business and in part because this startup was mucking around near\ntheir precious cargo. As SpaceX started to move from the testing phase to\nthe launch, it was told to get in line. They would have to wait months to\nlaunch. \u201cEven though they said we could fly, it was clear that we would\nnot,\u201d said Gwynne Shotwell.\nSearching for a new site, Shotwell and Hans Koenigsmann put a\nMercator projection of the world up on the wall and looked for a name they\nrecognized along the equator, where the planet spins faster and gives\nrockets an added boost. The first name that jumped out was Kwajalein\nIsland\u2014or Kwaj\u2014the largest island in an atoll between Guam and Hawaii\nin the Pacific Ocean and part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. This\nspot registered with Shotwell because the U.S. Army had used it for\ndecades as a missile test site. Shotwell looked up the name of a colonel at\nthe test site and sent him an e-mail, and three weeks later got a call back\nwith the army saying they would love to have SpaceX fly from the islands.\nIn June 2005, SpaceX\u2019s engineers began to fill containers with their\nequipment to ship them to Kwaj.\nAbout one hundred islands make up the Kwajalein Atoll. Many of them\nstretch for just a few hundred yards and are much longer than they are wide.\n\u201cFrom the air, the place looks like these beautiful beads on a string,\u201d said\nPete Worden, who visited the site in his capacity as a Defense Department\nconsultant. Most of the people in the area live on an island called Ebeye,\nwhile the U.S. military has taken over Kwajalein, the southernmost island,\nand turned it into part tropical paradise and part Dr. Evil\u2019s secret lair. The\nUnited States spent years lobbing its ICBMs from California at Kwaj and\nused the island to run experiments on its space weapons during the \u201cStar\nWars\u201d period. Laser beams would be aimed at Kwaj from space in a bid to\nsee if they were accurate and responsive enough to take out an ICBM", "hurtling toward the islands. The military presence resulted in a weird array\nof buildings including hulking, windowless trapezoidal concrete structures\nclearly conceived by someone who deals with death for a living.\nTo get to Kwaj, the SpaceX employees either flew on Musk\u2019s jet or took\ncommercial flights through Hawaii. The main accommodations were two-\nbedroom affairs on Kwajalein Island that looked more like dormitories than\nhotel rooms, with their military-issued dressers and desks. Any materials\nthat the engineers needed had to be flown in on Musk\u2019s plane or were more\noften brought by boat from Hawaii or the mainland United States. Each day,\nthe SpaceX crew gathered their gear and took a forty-five-minute boat ride\nto Omelek, a seven-acre, palm-tree-and vegetation-covered island that\nwould be transformed into their launchpad. Over the course of several\nmonths, a small team of people cleared the brush, poured concrete to\nsupport the launchpad, and converted a double-wide trailer into offices. The\nwork was grueling and took place in soul-sapping humidity under a sun\npowerful enough to burn the skin through a T-shirt. Eventually, some of the\nworkers preferred to spend the night on Omelek rather than make the\njourney through rough waters back to the main island. \u201cSome of the offices\nwere turned into bedrooms with mattresses and cots,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cThen\nwe shipped over a very nice refrigerator and a good grill and plumbed in a\nshower. We tried to make it less like camping and more like living.\u201d\nThe sun rose at 7 A.M. each day, and that\u2019s when the SpaceX team got to\nwork. A series of meetings would take place with people listing what\nneeded to get done, and debating solutions to lingering problems. As the\nlarge structures arrived, the workers placed the body of the rocket\nhorizontally in a makeshift hangar and spent hours melding together all of\nits parts. \u201cThere was always something to do,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cIf the engine\nwasn\u2019t a problem, then there was an avionics problem or a software\nproblem.\u201d By 7 P.M., the engineers wound down their work. \u201cOne or two\npeople would decide it was their night to cook, and they would make steak\nand potatoes and pasta,\u201d Hollman said. \u201cWe had a bunch of movies and a\nDVD player, and some of us did a lot of fishing off the docks.\u201d For many of\nthe engineers, this was both a torturous and magical experience. \u201cAt Boeing\nyou could be comfortable, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen at SpaceX,\u201d said\nWalter Sims, a SpaceX tech expert who found time to get certified to dive\nwhile on Kwaj. \u201cEvery person on that island was a fucking star, and they", "were always holding seminars on radios or the engine. It was such an\ninvigorating place.\u201d\nThe engineers were constantly baffled by what Musk would fund and\nwhat he wouldn\u2019t. Back at headquarters, someone would ask to buy a\n$200,000 machine or a pricey part that they deemed essential to Falcon 1\u2019s\nsuccess, and Musk would deny the request. And yet he was totally\ncomfortable paying a similar amount to put a shiny surface on the factory\nfloor to make it look nice. On Omelek, the workers wanted to pave a two-\nhundred-yard pathway between the hangar and the launchpad to make it\neasier to transport the rocket. Musk refused. This left the engineers moving\nthe rocket and its wheeled support structure in the fashion of the ancient\nEgyptians. They laid down a series of wooden planks and rolled the rocket\nacross them, grabbing the last piece of wood from the back and running it\nforward in a continuous cycle.\nThe whole situation was ludicrous. A start-up rocket company had\nended up in the middle of nowhere trying to pull off one of the most\ndifficult feats known to man, and, truth be told, only a handful of the\nSpaceX team had any idea how to make a launch happen. Time and again,\nthe rocket would get marched out to the launchpad and hoisted vertical for a\ncouple of days, while technical and safety checks would reveal a litany of\nnew problems. The engineers worked on the rocket for as long as they could\nbefore laying it horizontal and marching it back to the hangar to avoid\ndamage from the salty air. Teams that had worked separately for months\nback at the SpaceX factory\u2014propulsion, avionics, software\u2014were thrust\ntogether on the island and forced to become an interdisciplinary whole. The\nsum total was an extreme learning and bonding exercise that played like a\ncomedy of errors. \u201cIt was like Gilligan\u2019s Island except with rockets,\u201d\nHollman said.\nIn November 2005, about six months after they had first gotten to the\nisland, the SpaceX team felt ready to give launching a shot. Musk flew in\nwith his brother, Kimbal, and joined the majority of the SpaceX team in the\nbarracks on Kwaj. On November 26, a handful of people woke up at 3 A.M.\nand filled the rocket with liquid oxygen. They then scampered off to an\nisland about three miles away for protection, while the rest of the SpaceX\nteam monitored the launch systems from a control room twenty-six miles\naway on Kwaj. The military gave SpaceX a six-hour launch window.\nEveryone was hoping to see the first stage take off and reach about 6,850", "miles per hour before giving way to the second stage, which would ignite\nup in the air and reach 17,000 miles per hour. But, while going through the\npre-launch checks, the engineers detected a major problem: a valve on a\nliquid oxygen tank would not close, and the LOX was boiling off into the\nair at 500 gallons per hour. SpaceX scrambled to fix the issue but lost too\nmuch of its fuel to launch before the window closed.\nWith that mission aborted, SpaceX ordered major LOX reinforcements\nfrom Hawaii and prepared for another attempt in mid-December. High\nwinds, faulty valves, and other errors thwarted that launch attempt. Before\nanother attempt could be made, SpaceX discovered on a Saturday night that\nthe rocket\u2019s power distribution systems had started malfunctioning and\nwould need new capacitors. On Sunday morning, the rocket was lowered\nand split into its two stages so that a technician could slide in and remove\nthe electrical boards. Someone found an electronics supplier that was open\non Sunday in Minnesota, and off a SpaceX employee flew to get some fresh\ncapacitors. By Monday he was in California and testing the parts at\nSpaceX\u2019s headquarters to make sure they passed various heat and vibration\nchecks, then on a plane again back to the islands. In under eighty hours, the\nelectronics had been returned in working order and installed in the rocket.\nThe dash to the United States and back showed that SpaceX\u2019s thirty-person\nteam had real pluck in the face of adversity and inspired everyone on the\nisland. A traditional three-hundred-person-strong aerospace launch crew\nwould never have tried to fix a rocket like that on the fly. But the energy,\nsmarts, and resourcefulness of the SpaceX team still could not overcome\ntheir inexperience or the difficult conditions. More problems arose and\nblocked any thoughts of a launch.\nFinally, on March 24, 2006, it was all systems go. The Falcon 1 stood\non its square launchpad and ignited. It soared into the sky, turning the island\nbelow it into a green spec amid a vast, blue expanse. In the control room,\nMusk paced as he watched the action, wearing shorts, flip-flops, and a T-\nshirt. Then, about twenty-five seconds in, it became clear that all was not\nwell. A fire broke out above the Merlin engine and suddenly this machine\nthat had been flying straight and true started to spin and then tumble\nuncontrollably back to Earth. The Falcon 1 ended up falling directly down\nonto the launch site. Most of the debris went into a reef 250 feet from the\nlaunchpad, and the satellite cargo smashed through SpaceX\u2019s machine shop\nroof and landed more or less intact on the floor. Some of the engineers put", "on their snorkeling and scuba gear and recovered the pieces, fitting all of\nthe rocket\u2019s remnants into two refrigerator-sized crates. \u201cIt is perhaps worth\nnoting that those launch companies that succeeded also took their lumps\nalong the way,\u201d Musk wrote in a postmortem. \u201cA friend of mine wrote to\nremind me that only 5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches succeeded; 3 of 5 for\nAriane; 9 of 20 for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz; and 9 of 18 for Proton. Having\nexperienced firsthand how hard it is to reach orbit, I have a lot of respect for\nthose that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays of space\nlaunch today.\u201d Musk closed the letter writing, \u201cSpaceX is in this for the\nlong haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.\u201d\nMusk and other SpaceX executives blamed the crash on an unnamed\ntechnician. They said this technician had done some work on the rocket one\nday before the launch and failed to properly tighten a fitting on a fuel pipe,\nwhich caused the fitting to crack. The fitting in question was something\nbasic\u2014an aluminum b-nut that\u2019s often used to connect a pair of tubes. The\ntechnician was Hollman. In the aftermath of the rocket crash, Hollman flew\nto Los Angeles to confront Musk directly. He\u2019d spent years working day\nand night on the Falcon 1 and felt enraged that Musk had called out him and\nhis team in public. Hollman knew that he\u2019d fastened the b-nut correctly and\nthat observers from NASA had been looking over his shoulder to check the\nwork. When Hollman charged into SpaceX\u2019s headquarters with a head full\nof fury, Mary Beth Brown tried to calm him and stop him from seeing\nMusk. Hollman kept going anyway, and the two of them proceeded to have\na shouting match at Musk\u2019s cubicle.\nAfter all the debris was analyzed, it turned out that the b-nut had almost\ncertainly cracked due to corrosion from the months in Kwaj\u2019s salty\natmosphere. \u201cThe rocket was literally crusted with salt on one side, and you\nhad to scrape it off,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cBut we had done a static fire three days\nearlier, and everything was fine.\u201d SpaceX had tried to save about fifty\npounds of weight by using aluminum components instead of stainless steel.\nThompson, the former marine, had seen the aluminum parts work just fine\nin helicopters that sat on aircraft carriers, and Mueller had seen aircraft\nresting outside of Cape Canaveral for forty years with aluminum b-nuts in\nfine condition. Years later, a number of SpaceX\u2019s executives still agonize\nover the way Hollman and his team were treated. \u201cThey were our best guys,\nand they kind of got blamed to get an answer out to the world,\u201d Mueller\nsaid. \u201cThat was really bad. We found out later that it was dumb luck.\u201d*", "After the crash, there was a lot of drinking at a bar on the main island.\nMusk wanted to launch again within six months, but putting together a new\nmachine would again require an immense amount of work. SpaceX had\nsome pieces for the vehicle ready in El Segundo but certainly not a ready-\nto-fire rocket. As they downed drinks, the engineers vowed to take a more\ndisciplined approach with their next craft and to work better as a collective.\nWorden hoped the SpaceX engineers would raise their game as well. He\u2019d\nbeen observing them for the Defense Department and loved the energy of\nthe young engineers but not their methodology. \u201cIt was being done like a\nbunch of kids in Silicon Valley would do software,\u201d Worden said. \u201cThey\nwould stay up all night and try this and try that. I\u2019d seen hundreds of these\ntypes of operations, and it struck me that it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Leading up to\nthe first launch, Worden tried to caution Musk, sending a letter to him and\nthe director of DARPA, the research arm of the Defense Department, that\nmade his views clear. \u201cElon didn\u2019t react well. He said, \u2018What do you know?\nYou\u2019re just an astronomer,\u2019\u201d Worden said. But, after the rocket blew up,\nMusk recommended that Worden perform an investigation for the\ngovernment. \u201cI give Elon huge credit for that,\u201d Worden said.\nAlmost exactly a year later, SpaceX was ready to try another launch. On\nMarch 15, 2007, a successful test fire took place. Then, on March 21, the\nFalcon 1 finally behaved. From its launchpad surrounded by palm trees, the\nFalcon 1 surged up and toward space. It flew for a couple of minutes with\nengineers now and again reporting that the systems were \u201cnominal,\u201d or in\ngood shape. At three minutes into the flight, the first stage of the rocket\nseparated and fell back to Earth, and the Kestrel engine kicked in as planned\nto carry the second stage into orbit. Ecstatic cheers went out in the control\nroom. Next, at the four-minute mark, the fairing atop the rocket separated as\nplanned. \u201cIt was doing exactly what it was supposed to do,\u201d said Mueller. \u201cI\nwas sitting next to Elon and looked at him and said, \u2018We\u2019ve made it.\u2019 We\u2019re\nhugging and believe it\u2019s going to make it to orbit. Then, it starts to wiggle.\u201d\nFor more than five glorious minutes, the SpaceX engineers got to feel like\nthey had done everything right. A camera on board the Falcon 1 pointed\ndown and showed Earth getting smaller and smaller as the rocket made its\nway methodically into space. But then that wiggle that Mueller noticed\nturned into flailing, and the machine swooned, started to break apart, and\nthen blew up. This time the SpaceX engineers were quick to figure out what\nwent wrong. As the propellant was consumed, what was left started to move", "around the tank and slosh against the sides, much like wine spinning around\na glass. The sloshing propellant triggered the wobbling, and at one point it\nsloshed enough to leave an opening to the engine exposed. When the engine\nsucked in a big breath of air, it flamed out.\nThe failure was another crushing blow to SpaceX\u2019s engineers. Some of\nthem had spent close to two years shuffling back and forth between\nCalifornia, Hawaii, and Kwaj. By the time SpaceX could attempt another\nlaunch, it would be about four years after Musk\u2019s original target, and the\ncompany had been chewing through his Internet fortune at a worrying rate.\nMusk had vowed publicly that he would see this thing through to the end,\nbut people inside and outside the company were doing back-of-the-\nenvelope math and could tell that SpaceX likely could only afford one more\nattempt\u2014maybe two. To the extent that the financial situation unnerved\nMusk, he rarely if ever let it show to employees. \u201cElon did a great job of not\nburdening people with those worries,\u201d said Spikes. \u201cHe always\ncommunicated the importance of being lean and of success, but it was never\n\u2018if we fail, we\u2019re done for.\u2019 He was very optimistic.\u201d\nThe failures seemed to do little to curtail Musk\u2019s vision for the future or\nraise doubts about his capabilities. In the midst of the chaos, he took a tour\nof the islands with Worden. Musk began thinking aloud about how the\nislands could be unified into one landmass. He suggested that walls could\nbe built through the small channels between the islands, and the water could\nbe pumped out in the spirit of the manmade systems in the Netherlands.\nWorden, also known for his out-there ideas, was attracted to Musk\u2019s\nbravado. \u201cThat he is thinking of this stuff is kind of cool,\u201d Worden said.\n\u201cFrom that point on, he and I discussed settling Mars. It really impressed\nme that this is a guy that thinks big.\u201d", "PHOTOGRAPHIC INSERT\nThe Haldeman children had lots of downtime in the African bush while on wild adventures with their\nparents. \u00a9Maye Musk", "As a toddler, Musk would often drift off into his own world and ignore those around him.

STRAUBEL HAS A TWO-INCH-LONG SCAR that cuts across the\nmiddle of his left cheek. He earned it in high school, during a chemistry\nclass experiment. Straubel whipped up the wrong concoction of chemicals,\nand the beaker he was holding exploded, throwing off shards of glass, one\nof which sliced through his face.\nThe wound lingers as a tinkerer\u2019s badge of honor. It arrived near the end\nof a childhood full of experimentation with chemicals and machines. Born\nin Wisconsin, Straubel constructed a large chemistry lab in the basement of\nhis family\u2019s home that included fume hoods and chemicals ordered,\nborrowed, or pilfered. At thirteen, Straubel found an old golf cart at the\ndump. He brought it back home and restored it to working condition, which\nrequired him to rebuild the electric motor. It seemed that Straubel was\nalways taking something apart, sprucing it up, and putting it back together.\nAll of this fit into the Straubel family\u2019s do-it-yourself traditions. In the late\n1890s Straubel\u2019s great-grandfather started the Straubel Machine Company,\nwhich built one of the first internal combustion engines in the United States\nand used it to power boats.\nStraubel\u2019s inquisitive spirit carried him west to Stanford University,\nwhere he enrolled in 1994 intending to become a physicist. After flying\nthrough the hardest courses he could take, Straubel concluded that majoring\nin physics would not be for him. The advanced courses were too theoretical,\nand Straubel liked to get his hands dirty. He developed his own major called\nenergy systems and engineering. \u201cI wanted to take software and electricity\nand use it to control energy,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cIt was computing combined\nwith power electronics. I collected all the things I love doing in one place.\u201d\nThere was no clean-technology movement at this time, but there were\ncompanies dabbling with new uses for solar power and electric vehicles.\nStraubel ended up hunting down these startups, hanging out in their garages\nand pestering the engineers. He began tinkering once again on his own as\nwell in the garage of a house he shared with a half dozen friends. Straubel", "bought a \u201cpiece of shit Porsche\u201d for $1,600 and turned it into an electric car.\nThis meant that Straubel had to create a controller to manage the electric\nmotor, build a charger from scratch, and write the software that made the\nentire machine work. The car set the world record for electric vehicle (EV)\nacceleration, traveling a quarter mile in 17.28 seconds. \u201cThe thing I took\naway was that the electronics were great, and you could get acceleration on\na shoestring budget, but the batteries sucked,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cIt had a thirty-\nmile range, so I learned firsthand about some of the limitations of electric\nvehicles.\u201d Straubel gave his car a hybrid boost, building a gasoline-powered\ncontraption that could be towed behind the Porsche and used to recharge the\nbatteries. It was good enough for Straubel to drive the four hundred miles\ndown to Los Angeles and back.\nBy 2002, Straubel was living in Los Angeles. He\u2019d gotten a master\u2019s\ndegree from Stanford and bounced around a couple of companies looking\nfor something that called out to him. He decided on Rosen Motors, which\nhad built one of the world\u2019s first hybrid vehicles\u2014a car that ran off a\nflywheel and a gas turbine and had electric motors to drive the wheel. After\nit folded, Straubel followed Harold Rosen, an engineer famed for inventing\nthe geostationary satellite, to create an electric plane. \u201cI\u2019m a pilot and love\nto fly, so this was perfect for me,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cThe idea was that it would\nstay aloft for two weeks at a time and hover over a specific spot. This was\nway before drones and all that.\u201d To help make ends meet, Straubel also\nworked nights and on the weekend doing electronics consulting for a start-\nup.\nIt was in the midst of toiling away on all these projects that Straubel\u2019s\nold buddies from the Stanford solar car team came to pay him a visit. A\ngroup of rogue engineers at Stanford had been working on solar cars for\nyears, building them in a World War II\u2013era Quonset hut full of toxic\nchemicals and black widows. Unlike today, when the university would jump\nat the chance to support such a project, Stanford tried to shut down this\ngroup of fringe freaks and geeks. The students proved very capable of doing\nthe work on their own and competed in cross-country solar-powered car\nraces. Straubel helped build the vehicles during his time at university and\neven after, forming relationships with the incoming crop of engineers. The\nteam had just raced 2,300 miles from Chicago to Los Angeles, and Straubel\noffered the strapped, exhausted kids a place to stay. About a half dozen\nstudents showed up at Straubel\u2019s place, took their first showers in many", "days, and then spread across his floor. As they chatted late into the night,\nStraubel and the solar team kept fixating on one topic. They realized that\nlithium ion batteries\u2014such as the ones in their car being fed by the sun\u2014\nhad gotten much better than most people realized. Many consumer\nelectronics devices like laptops were running on so-called 18650 lithium ion\nbatteries, which looked a lot like AA batteries and could be strung together.\n\u201cWe wondered what would happen if you put ten thousand of the battery\ncells together,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cWe did the math and figured you could go\nalmost one thousand miles. It was totally nerdy shit, and eventually\neveryone fell asleep, but the idea really stuck with me.\u201d\nSoon enough, Straubel was stalking the solar car crew, trying to talk\nthem into building an electric car based on the lithium ion batteries. He\nwould fly up to Palo Alto, spend the night sleeping in his plane, and then\nride a bicycle to the Stanford campus to make his sales pitch while helping\nwith their current projects. The design Straubel had come up with was a\nsuper-aerodynamic vehicle with 80 percent of its mass made up of the\nbatteries. It looked quite a bit like a torpedo on wheels. No one knew the\nexact details of Straubel\u2019s long-term vision for this thing, including\nStraubel. The plan seemed to be less about forming a car company than\nabout building a proof-of-concept vehicle just to get people thinking about\nthe power of the lithium ion batteries. With any luck, they would find a race\nto compete in.\nThe Stanford students agreed to join Straubel, if he could raise some\nmoney. He began going to trade shows handing out brochures about his idea\nand e-mailing just about anyone he could think of. \u201cI was shameless,\u201d he\nsaid. The only problem was that no one had any interest in what Straubel\nwas selling. Investors dealt him one rejection after another for months on\nend. Then, in the fall of 2003, Straubel met Elon Musk.\nHarold Rosen had set up a lunch with Musk at a seafood restaurant near\nthe SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles and brought Straubel along to help\ntalk up the electric plane idea. When Musk didn\u2019t bite on that, Straubel\nannounced his electric car side project. The crazy idea struck an immediate\nchord with Musk, who had been thinking about electric vehicles for years.\nWhile Musk had mostly focused on using ultracapacitors for the vehicles,\nhe was thrilled and surprised to hear how far the lithium ion battery\ntechnology had progressed. \u201cEveryone else had told me I was nuts, but Elon\nloved the idea,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sure, I will give you some", "money.\u2019\u201d Musk promised Straubel $10,000 of the $100,000 he was seeking.\nOn the spot, Musk and Straubel formed a kinship that would survive more\nthan a decade of extreme highs and lows as they set out to do nothing less\nthan change the world.\nAfter the meeting with Musk, Straubel reached out to his friends at AC\nPropulsion. The Los Angeles\u2013based company started in 1992 and was the\nbleeding edge of electric vehicles, building everything from zippy midsize\npassenger jobs right on up to sports cars. Straubel really wanted to show\nMusk the tzero (from \u201ct-zero\u201d)\u2014the highest-end vehicle in AC Propulsion\u2019s\nstable. It was a type of kit car that had a fiberglass body sitting on top of a\nsteel frame and went from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds when\nfirst unveiled in 1997. Straubel had spent years hanging out with the AC\nPropulsion crew and asked Tom Gage, the company\u2019s president, to bring a\ntzero over for Musk to drive. Musk fell for the car. He saw its potential as a\nscreaming-fast machine that could shift the perception of electric cars from\nboring and plodding to something aspirational. For months Musk offered to\nfund an effort to transform the kit car into a commercial vehicle but got\nrebuffed time and again. \u201cIt was a proof of concept and needed to be made\nreal,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cI love the hell out of the AC Propulsion guys, but they\nwere sort of hopeless at business and refused to do it. They kept trying to\nsell Elon on this car called the eBox that looked like shit, didn\u2019t have good\nperformance, and was just uninspiring.\u201d While the meetings with AC\nPropulsion didn\u2019t result in a deal, they had solidified Musk\u2019s interest in\nbacking something well beyond Straubel\u2019s science project. In a late\nFebruary 2004 e-mail to Gage, Musk wrote, \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do is figure\nout the best choice of a high performance base car and electric powertrain\nand go in that direction.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to Straubel, at about the same time, a couple of business\npartners in Northern California had also fallen in love with the idea of\nmaking a lithium ion battery powered car. Martin Eberhard and Marc\nTarpenning had founded NuvoMedia in 1997 to create one of the earliest\nelectronic book readers, called the Rocket eBook. The work at NuvoMedia\nhad given the men insight into cutting-edge consumer electronics and the\nhugely improved lithium ion batteries used to power laptops and other\nportable devices. While the Rocket eBook was too far ahead of its time and\nnot a major commercial success, it was innovative enough to attract the\nattention of Gemstar International Group, which owned TV Guide and some", "electronic programming guide technology. Gemstar paid $187 million to\nacquire NuvoMedia in March 2000. Spoils in hand, the cofounders stayed\nin touch after the deal. They both lived in Woodside, one of the wealthiest\ntowns in Silicon Valley, and chatted from time to time about what they\nshould tackle next. \u201cWe thought up some goofball things,\u201d said Tarpenning.\n\u201cThere was one plan for these fancy irrigation systems for farms and the\nhome based on smart water-sensing networks. But nothing really resonated,\nand we wanted something more important.\u201d\nEberhard was a supremely talented engineer with a do-gooder\u2019s social\nconscience. The United States\u2019 repeated conflicts in the Middle East\nbothered him, and like many other science-minded folks around 2000 he\nhad started to accept global warming as a reality. Eberhard began looking\nfor alternatives to gas-guzzling cars. He investigated the potential of\nhydrogen fuel cells but found them lacking. He also didn\u2019t see much point\nin leasing something like the EV1 electric car from General Motors. What\ndid catch Eberhard\u2019s interest, however, were the all-electric cars from AC\nPropulsion that he spied on the Internet. Eberhard went down to Los\nAngeles around 2001 to visit the AC Propulsion shop. \u201cThe place looked\nlike a ghost town and like they were going out of business,\u201d Eberhard said.\n\u201cI bailed them out with five hundred thousand dollars so that they could\nbuild one of their cars for me with lithium ion instead of lead acid\nbatteries.\u201d Eberhard too tried to goad AC Propulsion into being a\ncommercial enterprise rather than a hobby shop. When they rejected his\novertures, Eberhard decided to form his own company and see what the\nlithium ion batteries could really do.\nEberhard\u2019s journey began with him building a technical model of the\nelectric car on a spreadsheet. This let him tweak various components and\nsee how they might affect the vehicle\u2019s shape and performance. He could\nadjust the weight, number of batteries, resistance of the tires and body, and\nthen get back answers on how many batteries it would take to power the\nvarious designs. The models made it clear that SUVs, which were very\npopular at the time, and things like delivery trucks were unlikely\ncandidates. The technology seemed instead to favor a lighter-weight, high-\nend sports car, which would be fast, fun to drive, and have far better range\nthan most people would expect. These technical specifications\ncomplemented the findings of Tarpenning, who had been doing research\ninto a financial model for the car. The Toyota Prius had started to take off in", "California, and it was being purchased by wealthy eco-crusaders. \u201cWe also\nlearned that the average income for EV1 owners was around two hundred\nthousand dollars per year,\u201d Tarpenning said. People who used to go after the\nLexus, BMW, and Cadillac brands saw electric and hybrid cars as a\ndifferent kind of status symbol. The men figured they could build\nsomething for the $3 billion per year luxury auto market in the United\nStates that would let rich people have fun and feel good about themselves\ntoo. \u201cPeople pay for cool and sexy and an amazing zero-to-sixty time,\u201d\nTarpenning said.\nOn July 1, 2003, Eberhard and Tarpenning incorporated their new\ncompany. While at Disneyland a few months earlier on a date with his wife,\nEberhard had come up with the name Tesla Motors, both to pay homage to\nthe inventor and electric motor pioneer Nikola Tesla and because it sounded\ncool. The cofounders rented an office that had three desks and two small\nrooms in a decrepit 1960s building located at 845 Oak Grove Avenue in\nMenlo Park. The third desk was occupied a few months later by Ian Wright,\nan engineer who grew up on a farm in New Zealand. He was a neighbor of\nthe Tesla cofounders in Woodside, and had been working with them to hone\nhis pitch for a networking startup. When the start-up failed to raise any\nmoney from venture capitalists, Wright joined Tesla. As the three men\nbegan to tell some of their confidants of their plans, they were confronted\nwith universal derision. \u201cWe met a friend at this Woodside pub to tell her\nwhat we had finally decided to do and that it was going to be an electric\ncar,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cShe said, \u2018You have to be kidding me.\u2019\u201d\nAnyone who tries to build a car company in the United States is quickly\nreminded that the last successful start-up in the industry was Chrysler,\nfounded in 1925. Designing and building a car from the ground up comes\nwith plenty of challenges, but it\u2019s really getting the money and know-how\nto build lots of cars that has thwarted past efforts to get a new company\ngoing. The Tesla founders were aware of these realities. They figured that\nNikola Tesla had built an electric motor a century earlier and that creating a\ndrivetrain to take the power from the motor and send it to the wheels was\ndoable. The really frightening part of their enterprise would be building the\nfactory to make the car and its associated parts. But the more the Tesla guys\nresearched the industry, the more they realized that the big automakers\ndon\u2019t even really build their cars anymore. The days of Henry Ford having\nraw materials delivered to one end of his Michigan factory and then sending", "cars out the other end had long passed. \u201cBMW didn\u2019t make its windshields\nor upholstery or rearview mirrors,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cThe only thing the big\ncar companies had kept was internal combustion research, sales and\nmarketing, and the final assembly. We thought na\u00efvely that we could access\nall the same suppliers for our parts.\u201d\nThe plan the Tesla cofounders came up with was to license some\ntechnology from AC Propulsion around the tzero vehicle and to use the\nLotus Elise chassis for the body of their car. Lotus, the English carmaker,\nhad released the two-door Elise in 1996, and it certainly had the sleek,\nground-hugging appeal to make a statement to high-end car buyers. After\ntalking to a number of people in the car dealership business, the Tesla team\ndecided to avoid selling their cars through partners and sell direct. With\nthese basics of a plan in place, the three men went hunting for some venture\ncapital funding in January 2004.\nTo make things feel more real for the investors, the Tesla founders\nborrowed a tzero from AC Propulsion and drove it to the venture capital\ncorridor of Sand Hill Road. The car accelerated faster than a Ferrari, and\nthis translated into visceral excitement for the investors. The downside,\nthough, was that venture capitalists are not a terribly imaginative bunch,\nand they struggled to see past the crappy plastic finish of this glorified kit\ncar. The only venture capitalists that bit were Compass Technology Partners\nand SDL Ventures, and they didn\u2019t sound altogether thrilled. The lead\npartner at Compass had made out well on NuvoMedia and felt some loyalty\nto Eberhard and Tarpenning. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is stupid, but I have invested in\nevery automotive start-up for the last forty years, so why not,\u2019\u201d Tarpenning\nrecalled. Tesla still needed a lead investor who would pony up the bulk of\nthe $7 million needed to make what\u2019s known as a mule or a prototype\nvehicle. That would be their first milestone and give them something\nphysical to show off, which could aid a second round of funding.\nEberhard and Tarpenning had Elon Musk\u2019s name in the back of their\nheads as a possible lead investor from the outset. They had both seen him\nspeak a couple of years earlier at a Mars Society conference held at\nStanford where Musk had laid out his vision of sending mice into space,\nand they got the impression that he thought a bit differently and would be\nopen to the idea of an electric car. The idea to pitch Musk on Tesla Motors\nsolidified when Tom Gage from AC Propulsion called Eberhard and told\nhim that Musk was looking to fund something in the electric car arena.", "Eberhard and Wright flew down to Los Angeles and met with Musk on a\nFriday. That weekend, Musk peppered Tarpenning, who had been away on a\ntrip, with questions about the financial model. \u201cI just remember responding,\nresponding, and responding,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cThe following Monday,\nMartin and I flew down to meet him again, and he said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d\nThe Tesla founders felt like they had lucked into the perfect investor.\nMusk had the engineering smarts to know what they were building. He also\nshared their larger goal of trying to end the United States\u2019 addiction to oil.\n\u201cYou need angel investors to have some belief, and it wasn\u2019t a purely\nfinancial transaction for him,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cHe wanted to change the\nenergy equation of the country.\u201d With an investment of $6.5 million, Musk\nhad become the largest shareholder of Tesla and the chairman of the\ncompany. Musk would later wield his position of strength well while\nbattling Eberhard for control of Tesla. \u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Eberhard said. \u201cI\nwanted more investors. But, if I had to do it again, I would take his money.\nA bird in the hand, you know. We needed it.\u201d\nNot long after this meeting took place, Musk called Straubel and urged\nhim to meet with the Tesla team. Straubel heard that their offices in Menlo\nPark were about a half a mile from his house, and he was intrigued but very\nskeptical of their story. No one on the planet was more dialed into the\nelectric vehicle scene than Straubel, and he found it hard to believe that a\ncouple of guys had gotten this far along without word of their project\nreaching him. Nonetheless, Straubel stopped by the office for a meeting,\nand was hired right away in May 2004 at a salary of $95,000 per year. \u201cI\ntold them that I had been building the battery pack they need down the\nstreet with funding from Elon,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cWe agreed to join forces and\nformed this ragtag group.\u201d\nHad anyone from Detroit stopped by Tesla Motors at this point, they\nwould have ended up in hysterics. The sum total of the company\u2019s\nautomotive expertise was that a couple of the guys at Tesla really liked cars\nand another one had created a series of science fair projects based on\ntechnology that the automotive industry considered ridiculous. What\u2019s\nmore, the founding team had no intention of turning to Detroit for advice on\nhow to build a car company. No, Tesla would do what every other Silicon\nValley start-up had done before it, which was hire a bunch of young, hungry\nengineers and figure things out as they went along. Never mind that the Bay\nArea had no real history of this model ever having worked for something", "like a car and that building a complex, physical object had little in common\nwith writing a software application. What Tesla did have, ahead of anyone\nelse, was the realization that 18650 lithium ion batteries had gotten really\ngood and were going to keep getting better. Hopefully that coupled with\nsome effort and smarts would be enough.\nStraubel had a direct pipeline into the smart, energetic engineers at\nStanford and told them about Tesla. Gene Berdichevsky, one of the\nmembers of the solar-powered-car team, lit up the second he heard from\nStraubel. An undergraduate, Berdichevsky volunteered to quit school, work\nfor free, and sweep the floors at Tesla if that\u2019s what it took to get a job. The\nfounders were impressed with his spirit and hired Berdichevsky after one\nmeeting. This left Berdichevsky in the uncomfortable position of calling his\nRussian immigrant parents, a pair of nuclear submarine engineers, to tell\nthem that he was giving up on Stanford to join an electric car start-up. As\nemployee No. 7, he spent part of the workday in the Menlo Park office and\nthe rest in Straubel\u2019s living room designing three-dimensional models of the\ncar\u2019s powertrain on a computer and building battery pack prototypes in the\ngarage. \u201cOnly now do I realize how insane it was,\u201d Berdichevsky said.\nTesla soon needed to expand to accommodate its budding engineer army\nand to create a workshop that would help bring the Roadster, as they were\nnow calling the car, to life. They found a two-story industrial building in\nSan Carlos at 1050 Commercial Street. The 10,000-square-foot facility\nwasn\u2019t much, but it had room to build a research and development shop\ncapable of knocking out some prototype cars. There were a couple of large\nassembly bays on the ride side of the building and two large rollup doors\nbig enough for cars to drive in and out. Wright divided the open floor space\ninto segments\u2014motors, batteries, power electronics, and final assembly.\nThe left half of the building was an office space that had been modified in\nweird ways by the previous tenant, a plumbing supply company. The main\nconference room had a wet bar and a sink where the faucet was a swan\u2019s\nmouth, and the hot and cold knobs were wings. Berdichevsky painted the\noffice white on a Sunday night, and the next week the employees made a\nfield trip to IKEA to buy desks and hopped online to order their computers\nfrom Dell. As for tools, Tesla had a single Craftsman toolbox loaded with\nhammers, nails, and other carpentry basics. Musk would visit now and\nagain from Los Angeles and was unfazed by the conditions, having seen\nSpaceX grow up in similar surroundings.", "The original plan for producing a prototype vehicle sounded simple.\nTesla would take the AC Propulsion tzero powertrain and fit it into the\nLotus Elise body. The company had acquired a schematic for an electric\nmotor design and figured it could buy a transmission from a company in the\nUnited States or Europe and outsource any other parts from Asia. Tesla\u2019s\nengineers mostly needed to focus on developing the battery pack systems,\nwiring the car, and cutting and welding metal as needed to bring everything\ntogether. Engineers love to muck around with hardware, and the Tesla team\nthought of the Roadster as something akin to a car conversion project that\ncould be done with two or three mechanical engineers, and a few assembly\npeople.\nThe main team of prototype builders consisted of Straubel,\nBerdichevsky, and David Lyons, a very clever mechanical engineer and\nemployee No. 12. Lyons had about a decade of experience working for\nSilicon Valley companies and had met Straubel a few years before when the\ntwo men struck up a conversation at a 7-Eleven about an electric bike\nStraubel was riding. Lyons had helped Straubel pay bills by hiring him as a\nconsultant for a company building a device to measure people\u2019s core body\ntemperature. Straubel thought he could return the favor by bringing Lyons\non early to such an exciting project. Tesla would benefit in a big way as\nwell. As Berdichevsky put it, \u201cDave Lyons knew how to get shit done.\u201d\nThe engineers bought a blue lift for the car and set it up inside the\nbuilding. They also purchased some machine tools, hand tools, and\nfloodlights to work at night and started to turn the facility into a hotbed of\nR&D activity. Electrical engineers studied the Lotus\u2019s base-level software\nto figure out how it tied together the pedals, mechanical apparatus, and the\ndashboard gauges. The really advanced work took place with the battery\npack design. No one had ever tried to combine hundreds of lithium ion\nbatteries in parallel, so Tesla ended up at the cutting edge of the technology.\nThe engineers started trying to understand how heat would dissipate and\ncurrent flow would behave across seventy batteries by supergluing them\ntogether into groups called bricks. Then ten bricks would be placed\ntogether, and the engineers would test various types of air and liquid\ncooling mechanisms. When the Tesla team had developed a workable\nbattery pack, they stretched the yellow Lotus Elise chassis five inches and\nlowered the pack with a crane into the back of the car, where its engine\nwould normally be. These efforts began in earnest on October 18, 2004,", "and, rather remarkably, four months later, on January 27, 2005, an entirely\nnew kind of car had been built by eighteen people. It could even be driven\naround. Tesla had a board meeting that day, and Musk zipped about in the\ncar. He came away happy enough to keep investing. Musk put in $9 million\nmore as Tesla raised a $13 million funding round. The company now\nplanned to deliver the Roadster to consumers in early 2006.\nOnce they\u2019d finished building a second car a few months later, the\nengineers at Tesla decided they needed to face up to a massive potential\nflaw in their electric vehicle. On July 4, 2005, they were at Eberhard\u2019s\nhouse in Woodside celebrating Independence Day and figured it was as\ngood a moment as any to see what happened when the Roadster\u2019s batteries\ncaught on fire. Someone taped twenty of the batteries together, put a heating\nstrip wire into the bundle, and set it off. \u201cIt went up like a cluster of bottle\nrockets,\u201d Lyons said. Instead of twenty batteries, the Roadster would have\nclose to 7,000, and the thought of what an explosion at that scale would be\nlike horrified the engineers. One of the perks of an electric car was meant to\nbe that it moved people away from a flammable liquid like gasoline and the\nendless explosions that take place in an engine. Rich people were unlikely\nto pay a high price for something even more dangerous, and the early\nnightmare scenario for the employees at Tesla was that a rich, famous\nperson would get caught in a fire caused by the car. \u201cIt was one of those \u2018oh\nshit\u2019 moments,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThat is when we really sobered up.\u201d\nTesla formed a six-person task force to deal with the battery issue. They\nwere pulled off all other work and given money to begin running\nexperiments. The first explosions started taking place at the Tesla\nheadquarters, where the engineers filmed them in slow motion. Once saner\nminds prevailed, Tesla moved its explosion research to a blast area behind\nan electrical substation maintained by the fire department. Blast by blast,\nthe engineers learned a great deal about the inner workings of the batteries.\nThey developed methods for arranging them in ways that would prevent\nfires spreading from one battery to the next and other techniques for\nstopping explosions altogether. Thousands of batteries exploded along the\nway, and the effort was worth it. It was still early days, for sure, but Tesla\nwas on the verge of inventing battery technology that would set it apart\nfrom rivals for years to come and would become one of the company\u2019s great\nadvantages.", "The early success at building two prototype cars, coupled with Tesla\u2019s\nengineering breakthroughs around the batteries and other technological\npieces, boosted the company\u2019s confidence. It was time to put Tesla\u2019s stamp\non the vehicle. \u201cThe original plan had been to do the bare minimum we\ncould get away with as far as making the car stylistically different from a\nLotus but electric,\u201d said Tarpenning. \u201cAlong the way, Elon and the rest of\nthe board said, \u2018You only get to do this once. It has to delight the customer,\nand the Lotus just isn\u2019t good enough to do that.\u2019\u201d\nThe Elise\u2019s chassis, or base frame, worked fine for Tesla\u2019s engineering\npurposes. But the body of the car had serious issues in both form and\nfunction. The door on the Elise was all of a foot tall, and you were meant to\neither jump into the car or fall into it, depending on your flexibility and/or\ndignity. The body also needed to be longer to accommodate Tesla\u2019s battery\npack and a trunk. And Tesla preferred to make the Roadster out of carbon\nfiber instead of fiberglass. On these design points, Musk had a lot of\nopinion and influence. He wanted a car that Justine could feel comfortable\ngetting into and that had some measure of practicality. Musk made these\nopinions clear when he visited Tesla for board meetings and design reviews.\nTesla hired a handful of designers to mock up new looks for the\nRoadster. After settling on a favorite, the company paid to build a quarter-\nscale model of the vehicle in January 2005 and then a full-scale model in\nApril. This process provided the Tesla executives with yet another\nrevelation of everything that went into making a car. \u201cThey wrap this shiny\nMylar material around the model and vacuum it, so that you can really see\nthe contours and shine and shadows,\u201d Tarpenning said. The silver model\nwas then turned into a digital rendering that the engineers could manipulate\non their computers. A British company took the digital file and used it to\ncreate a plastic version of the car called an \u201caero buck\u201d for aerodynamics\ntesting. \u201cThey put it on a boat and shipped it to us, and then we took it to\nBurning Man,\u201d Tarpenning said, referring to the annual drug-infused art\nfestival held in the Nevada desert.\nAbout a year later, after many tweaks and much work, Tesla had a\npencils-down moment. It was May 2006, and the company had grown to a\nhundred employees. This team built a black version of the Roadster known\nas EP1, or engineering prototype one. \u201cIt was saying, \u2018We now think we\nknow what we will build,\u2019\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cYou can feel it. It\u2019s a real car,\nand it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d The arrival of the EP1 provided a great excuse to", "show existing investors what their money had bought and to ask for more\nfunds from a wider audience. The venture capitalists were impressed\nenough to overlook the fact that engineers sometimes had to manually fan\nthe car to cool it down in between test drives and were now starting to grasp\nTesla\u2019s long-term potential. Musk once again put money into Tesla\u2014$12\nmillion\u2014and a handful of other investors, including the venture capital firm\nDraper Fisher Jurvetson, VantagePoint Capital Partners, J.P. Morgan,\nCompass Technology Partners, Nick Pritzker, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin,\njoined the $40 million round.*\nIn July 2006, Tesla decided to tell the world what it had been up to. The\ncompany\u2019s engineers had built a red prototype\u2014EP2\u2014to complement the\nblack one, and they both went on display at an event in Santa Clara. The\npress flocked to the announcement and were quite taken with what they\nsaw. The Roadsters were gorgeous, two-seater convertibles that could go\nfrom zero to 60 in about four seconds. \u201cUntil today,\u201d Musk said at the\nevent, \u201call electric cars have sucked.\u201d6\nCelebrities like then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former\nDisney CEO Michael Eisner showed up at the event, and many of them\ntook test rides in the Roadsters. The vehicles were so fragile that only\nStraubel and a couple of other trusted hands knew how to run them, and\nthey were swapped out every five minutes to avoid overheating. Tesla\nrevealed that each car would cost about $90,000 and had a range of 250\nmiles per charge. Thirty people, the company said, had committed to buying\na Roadster, including the Google cofounders Brin and Page and a handful of\nother technology billionaires. Musk promised that a cheaper car\u2014a four-\nseat, four-door model under $50,000, would arrive in about three years.\nAround the time of this event, Tesla made its debut in the New York\nTimes via a mini-profile on the company. Eberhard vowed\u2014optimistically\n\u2014to begin shipments of the Roadster in the middle of 2007, instead of early\n2006 as once planned, and laid out Tesla\u2019s strategy of starting with a high-\npriced, low-volume product and moving down to more affordable products\nover time, as underlying technology and manufacturing capabilities\nadvanced. Musk and Eberhard were big believers in this strategy, having\nseen it play out with a number of electronic devices. \u201cCellphones,\nrefrigerators, color TV\u2019s, they didn\u2019t start off by making a low-end product\nfor masses,\u201d Eberhard told the paper.7 \u201cThey were relatively expensive, for\npeople who could afford it.\u201d While the story was a coup for Tesla, Musk", "didn\u2019t appreciate being left out of the article entirely. \u201cWe tried to\nemphasize him, and told the reporter about him over and over again, but\nthey weren\u2019t interested in the board of the company,\u201d Tarpenning said.\n\u201cElon was furious. He was livid.\u201d\nYou could understand why Musk might want some of the shine of Tesla\nto rub off on him. The car had turned into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the automotive\nworld. Electric vehicles tended to invoke religious overreactions from both\nthe pro and con camps, and the appearance of a good-looking, fast electric\ncar stoked everyone\u2019s passions. Tesla had also turned Silicon Valley into a\nreal threat, at least conceptually, to Detroit for the first time. The month\nafter the Santa Monica event was the Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019Elegance, a\nfamous showcase for exotic cars. Tesla had become such a topic of\nconversation that the organizers of the event begged to have a Roadster and\nwaived the usual display fees. Tesla set up a booth, and people showed up\nby the dozens writing $100,000 checks on the spot to pre-order their cars.\n\u201cThis was long before Kickstarter, and we just had not thought of trying to\ndo that,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cBut then we started getting millions of dollars at\nthese types of events.\u201d Venture capitalists, celebrities, and friends of Tesla\nemployees began trying to buy their way onto the waiting list. Some of\nSilicon Valley\u2019s wealthy elite went so far as to show up at the Tesla office\nand knock on the door, looking to buy a car. The entrepreneurs Konstantin\nOthmer and Bruce Leak, who had known Musk from his internship days at\nRocket Science Games, did just that one weekday and ended up getting a\npersonal tour of the car from Musk and Eberhard that stretched over a\ncouple of hours. \u201cAt the end we said, \u2018We\u2019ll take one,\u2019\u201d Othmer said. \u201cThey\nweren\u2019t actually allowed to sell cars yet, though, so we joined their club. It\ncost one hundred thousand dollars, but one of the benefits of membership\nwas that you\u2019d get a free car.\u201d\nAs Tesla switched from marketing back into R&D mode, it had some\ntrends working in its favor. Advances in computing had made it so that\nsmall car companies could sometimes punch at the same weight as the\ngiants of the industry. Years ago, automakers would have needed to make a\nfleet of cars for crash testing. Tesla could not afford to do that, and it didn\u2019t\nhave to. The third Roadster engineering prototype went to the same\ncollision testing facility used by large automakers, giving Tesla access to\ntop-of-the-line high-speed cameras and other imaging technology.\nThousands of other tests, though, were done by a third party that specialized", "in computer simulations and saved Tesla from building a fleet of crash\nvehicles. Tesla also had equal access to the big guys\u2019 durability tracks made\nout of cobblestones and concrete embedded with metal objects. It could\nreplicate 100,000 miles and ten years of wear at these facilities.\nQuite often, the Tesla engineers brought their Silicon Valley attitude to\nthe automakers\u2019 traditional stomping grounds. There\u2019s a break and traction\ntesting track in northern Sweden near the Arctic Circle where cars get tuned\non large plains of ice. It would be standard to run the car for three days or\nso, get the data, and return to company headquarters for many weeks of\nmeetings about how to adjust the car. The whole process of tuning a car can\ntake the entire winter. Tesla, by contrast, sent its engineers along with the\nRoadsters being tested and had them analyze the data on the spot. When\nsomething needed to be tweaked, the engineers would rewrite some code\nand send the car back on the ice. \u201cBMW would need to have a confab\nbetween three or four companies that would all blame each other for the\nproblem,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cWe just fixed it ourselves.\u201d Another testing\nprocedure required that the Roadsters go into a special cooling chamber to\ncheck how they would respond to frigid temperatures. Not wanting to pay\nthe exorbitant costs to use one of these chambers, the Tesla engineers opted\nto rent an ice cream delivery truck with a large refrigerated trailer. Someone\nwould drive a Roadster into the truck, and the engineers would don parkas\nand work on the car.\nEvery time Tesla interacted with Detroit it received a reminder of how\nthe once-great city had been separated from its own can-do culture. Tesla\ntried to lease a small office in Detroit. The costs were incredibly low\ncompared with space in Silicon Valley, but the city\u2019s bureaucracy made\ngetting just a basic office an ordeal. The building\u2019s owner wanted to see\nseven years of audited financials from Tesla, which was still a private\ncompany. Then the building owner wanted two years\u2019 worth of advanced\nrent. Tesla had about $50 million in the bank and could have bought the\nbuilding outright. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, you say you\u2019re backed by a venture\ncapitalist, and that\u2019s the end of the negotiation,\u201d Tarpenning said. \u201cBut\neverything was like that in Detroit. We\u2019d get FedEx boxes, and they\ncouldn\u2019t even decide who should sign for the package.\u201d\nThroughout these early years, the engineers credited Eberhard with\nmaking quick, crisp decisions. Rarely did Tesla get hung up overanalyzing a\nsituation. The company would pick a plan of attack, and when it failed at", "something, it failed fast and then tried a new approach. It was many of the\nchanges that Musk wanted that started to delay the Roadster. Musk kept\npushing for the car to be more comfortable, asking for alterations to the\nseats and the doors. He made the carbon-fiber body a priority, and he\npushed for electronic sensors on the doors so that the Roadster could be\nunlocked with the touch of a finger instead of a tug on a handle. Eberhard\ngroused that these features were slowing the company down, and many of\nthe engineers agreed. \u201cIt felt at times like Elon was this unreasonably\ndemanding overarching force,\u201d said Berdichevsky. \u201cThe company as a\nwhole was sympathetic to Martin because he was there all the time, and we\nall felt the car should ship sooner.\u201d\nBy the middle of 2007, Tesla had grown to 260 employees and seemed\nto be pulling off the impossible. It had produced the fastest, most beautiful\nelectric car the world had ever seen almost from thin air. All it had to do\nnext was build a lot of the cars\u2014a process that would end up almost\nbankrupting the company.\nThe greatest mistake Tesla\u2019s executives made in the early days were\nassumptions around the transmission system for the Roadster. The goal had\nalways been to get from zero to 60 mph as quickly as possible in the hopes\nthat the raw speed of the Roadster would attract a lot of attention and make\nit fun to drive. To do this, Tesla\u2019s engineers had decided on a two-speed\ntransmission, which is the underlying mechanism in the car for transferring\npower from the motor to the wheels. The first gear would take the car from\nzero to 60 mph in less than four seconds, and then the second gear would\ntake the car up to 130 mph. Tesla had hired Xtrac, a British company\nspecializing in transmission designs, to build this part and had every reason\nto believe that this would be one of the smoother bits of the Roadster\u2019s\njourney. \u201cPeople had been making transmissions since Robert Fulton built\nthe steam engine,\u201d said Bill Currie,8 a veteran Silicon Valley engineer and\nemployee No. 86 at Tesla. \u201cWe thought you would just order one. But the\nfirst one we had lasted forty seconds.\u201d The initial transmission could not\nhandle the big jump from the first to the second gear, and the fear was that\nthe second gear would engage at high speed and not be synchronized with\nthe motor properly, which would result in catastrophic damage to the car.\nLyons and the other engineers quickly set out to try to fix the issue.\nThey found a couple of other contractors to design replacements and again\nhoped that these longtime transmission experts would deliver something", "usable with relative ease. It soon became apparent, however, that the\ncontractors were not always putting their A team to work on this project for\na tiny start-up in Silicon Valley and that the new transmissions were no\nbetter than the first. During tests, Tesla found that the transmissions would\nsometimes break after 150 miles and that the mean time between failures\nwas about 2,000 miles. When a team from Detroit ran a root cause analysis\nof the transmission to find failures, they discovered fourteen separate issues\nthat could cause the system to break. Tesla had wanted to deliver the\nRoadster in November 2007, but the transmission issues lingered, and by\nthe time January 1, 2008, rolled around, the company had to once again\nstart from scratch, on a third transmission push.\nTesla also faced issues abroad. The company had decided to send a team\nof its youngest, most energetic engineers to Thailand to set up a battery\nfactory. Tesla partnered with an enthusiastic although not totally capable\nmanufacturing partner. The Tesla engineers had been told that they could fly\nover and manage the construction of a state-of-the-art battery factory.\nInstead of a factory, they found a concrete slab with posts holding up a roof.\nThe building was about a three-hour drive south from Bangkok, and had\nbeen left mostly open like many of the other factories because of the\nincredible heat. The other manufacturing operations dealt with making\nstoves, tires, and commodities that could withstand the elements. Tesla had\nsensitive batteries and electronics, and like parts of the Falcon 1, they\u2019d be\nchewed up by the salty, humid conditions. Eventually, Tesla\u2019s partner paid\nabout $75,000 to put in drywall, coat the floor, and create storage rooms\nwith temperature controls. Tesla\u2019s engineers ended up working maddening\nhours trying to train the Thai workers on how to handle the electronics\nproperly. The development of the battery technology, which had once\nmoved along at a rapid pace, slowed to a crawl.\nThe battery factory was one part of a supply chain that stretched across\nthe globe, adding cost and delays to the Roadster production. Body panels\nfor the car were to be made in France, while the motors were to come from\nTaiwan. Tesla planned on buying battery cells in China and shipping them\nto Thailand to turn the piece parts into battery packs. The battery packs,\nwhich had to be stored for a minimal amount of time to avoid degradation,\nwould then be taken to port and shipped to England, where they needed to\nclear customs. Tesla then planned for Lotus to build the body of the car,\nattach the battery packs, and ship the Roadsters by boat around Cape Horn", "to Los Angeles. In that scenario, Tesla would have paid for the bulk of the\ncar and had no chance to recognize revenue on the parts until six to nine\nmonths had passed. \u201cThe idea was to get to Asia, get things done fast and\ncheap, and make money on the car,\u201d said Forrest North, one of the\nengineers sent to Thailand. \u201cWhat we found out was that for really\ncomplicated things, you can do the work cheaper here and have less delays\nand less problems.\u201d When some new hires came on, they were horrified to\ndiscover just how haphazard Tesla\u2019s plan appeared. Ryan Popple, who had\nspent four years in the army and then gotten an MBA from Harvard, arrived\nat Tesla as a director of finance meant to prep the company to go public.\nAfter examining the company\u2019s books early in his tenure, Popple asked the\nmanufacturing and operations head exactly how he would get the car made.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Well, we will decide we\u2019re going into production and then a\nmiracle is going to happen,\u2019\u201d Popple said.\nAs word of the manufacturing issues reached Musk, he became very\nconcerned about the way Eberhard had run the company and called in a\nfixer to address the situation. One of Tesla\u2019s investors was Valor Equity, a\nChicago-based investment firm that specialized in fine-tuning\nmanufacturing operations. The company had been drawn to Tesla\u2019s battery\nand powertrain technology and calculated that even if Tesla failed to sell\nmany cars, the big automakers would end up wanting to buy its intellectual\nproperty. To protect its investment, Valor sent in Tim Watkins, its managing\ndirector of operations, and he soon reached some horrific conclusions.\nWatkins is a Brit with degrees in industrial robotics and electrical\nengineering. He\u2019s built up a reputation as an ingenious solver of problems.\nWhile doing work in Switzerland, for example, Watkins found a way to get\naround the country\u2019s rigid labor laws that limit the hours employees can\nwork, by automating a metal stamping factory so that it could run twenty-\nfour hours per day instead of sixteen hours like the factories or rivals.\nWatkins is also known for keeping his ponytail in place with a black\nscrunchie, wearing a black leather jacket, and toting a black fanny pack\neverywhere he goes. The fanny pack has his passport, checkbook, earplugs,\nsunscreen, food, and an assortment of other necessities. \u201cIt\u2019s full of the\neveryday things I need to survive,\u201d said Watkins. \u201cIf I walk ten feet away\nfrom this thing, I sense it.\u201d While a bit eccentric, Watkins was thorough and\nspent weeks talking to employees and analyzing every part of Tesla\u2019s\nsupply chain to figure out how much it cost to make the Roadster.", "Tesla had done a decent job of keeping its employee costs down. It hired\nthe kid fresh out of Stanford for $45,000 rather than the proven guy who\nprobably didn\u2019t want to work that hard anyway for $120,000. But when it\ncame to equipment and materials, Tesla was a spending horror show. No\none liked using the company\u2019s software that tracked the bill of materials. So\nsome people used it, and some people didn\u2019t. Those that did use it often\nmade huge errors. They would take the cost of a part from the prototype\ncars and then estimate how much of a discount they expected when buying\nthat part in bulk, rather than actually negotiating to find a viable price. At\none point, the software declared that each Roadster should cost about\n$68,000, which would leave Tesla making about $30,000 per vehicle.\nEveryone knew the figure was wrong, but it got reported to the board\nanyway.\nAround the middle of 2007, Watkins came to Musk with his findings.\nMusk was prepared for a high figure but felt confident that the price of the\ncar would come down significantly over time as Tesla ironed out its\nmanufacturing process and increased its sales. \u201cThat\u2019s when Tim told me it\nwas really bad news,\u201d Musk said. It looked like each Roadster could cost up\nto $200,000 to make, and Tesla planned to sell the car for only around\n$85,000. \u201cEven in full production, they would have been like $170,000 or\nsomething insane,\u201d Musk said. \u201cOf course, it didn\u2019t much matter because\nabout a third of the cars didn\u2019t flat-out fucking work.\u201d\nEberhard made attempts to pull his team out of this mess. He\u2019d gone to\nsee a speech in which the famous venture capitalist John Doerr, who\nbecame a major investor in green technology companies, declared that he\nwould devote his time and money to trying to save the Earth from global\nwarming because he owed such an effort to his children. Eberhard promptly\nreturned to the Tesla building and ginned up a similar speech. In front of\nabout a hundred people, Eberhard had a picture of his young daughter\nprojected onto the wall of the main workshop. He asked the Tesla engineers\nwhy he had put that picture up. One of them guessed that it was because\npeople like his daughter would drive the car. To which Eberhard replied,\n\u201cNo. We are building this because by the time she is old enough to drive she\nwill know a car as something completely different to how we know it today,\njust like you don\u2019t think of a phone as a thing on the wall with a cord on it.\nIt\u2019s this future that depends on you.\u201d Eberhard then thanked some of the key\nengineers and called out their efforts in public. Many of the engineers had", "been pulling all-nighters on a regular basis and Eberhard\u2019s show boosted\nmorale. \u201cWe were all working ourselves to the point of exhaustion,\u201d said\nDavid Vespremi, a former Tesla spokesman. \u201cThen came this profound\nmoment where we were reminded that building the car was not about\ngetting to an IPO or selling it to a bunch of rich dudes but because it might\nchange what a car is.\u201d\nThese victories, though, were not enough to overcome the feeling\nshared by many of the Tesla engineers that Eberhard had reached the end of\nhis abilities as a CEO. The company veterans had always admired\nEberhard\u2019s engineering smarts and continued to do so. Eberhard, in fact,\nhad turned Tesla into a cult of engineering. Regrettably, other parts of the\ncompany had been neglected, and people doubted Eberhard\u2019s ability to take\nthe company from the R&D stage to production. The ridiculous cost of the\ncar, the transmission, the ineffective suppliers were crippling Tesla. And, as\nthe company started to miss its delivery dates, many of the once-fanatical\nconsumers who had made their large up-front payments turned on Tesla and\nEberhard. \u201cWe saw the writing on the wall,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cEveryone knew\nthat the person who starts a company is not necessarily the right person to\nlead it in the long term, but whenever that is the case, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nEberhard and Musk had battled for years over some of the design points\non the car. But for the most part, they had gotten along well enough. Neither\nman suffered fools. And they certainly shared many of the same visions for\nthe battery technology and what it could mean to the world. What their\nrelationship could not survive were the cost figures for the Roadster\nunearthed by Watkins. It looked to Musk as if Eberhard had grossly\nmismanaged the company by allowing the parts costs to soar so high. Then,\nas Musk saw it, Eberhard failed to disclose the severity of the situation to\nthe board. While on his way to give a talk to the Motor Press Guild in Los\nAngeles, Eberhard received a call from Musk and in a brief, uncomfortable\nchat learned that he would be replaced as CEO.\nIn August 2007, Tesla\u2019s board demoted Eberhard and named him\npresident of technology, which only exacerbated the company\u2019s issues.\n\u201cMartin was so bitter and disruptive,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cI remember him\nrunning around the office and sowing discontent, as we\u2019re trying to finish\nthe car and are running out of money and everything is at knife\u2019s edge.\u201d As\nEberhard saw it, other people at Tesla had foisted a wonky finance software\napplication on him that made it tricky to accurately track costs. He", "contended that the delays and cost increases were partly due to the requests\nof other members of the management team and that he\u2019d been up front with\nthe board about the issues. Beyond that, he thought Watkins had made the\nsituation out to be worse than it really was. Start-ups in Silicon Valley view\nmayhem as standard operating procedure. \u201cValor was used to dealing with\nolder companies,\u201d Eberhard said. \u201cThey found chaos and weren\u2019t used to it.\nThis was the chaos of a start-up.\u201d Eberhard had also already been asking\nTesla\u2019s board to replace him as CEO and find someone with more\nmanufacturing experience.\nA few months passed, and Eberhard remained pissed-off. Many of the\nTesla employees felt like they were caught in the middle of a divorce and\nhad to pick their parent\u2014Eberhard or Musk. By the time December arrived,\nthe situation was untenable, and Eberhard left the company altogether. Tesla\nsaid in a statement that Eberhard had been offered a position on its advisory\nboard, although he denied that. \u201cI am no longer with Tesla Motors\u2014neither\non its board of directors nor an employee of any sort,\u201d Eberhard said in a\nstatement at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the way I was treated.\u201d Musk\nsent a note to a Silicon Valley newspaper saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it came to\nthis and wish it were not so. It was not a question of personality differences,\nas the decision to have Martin transition to an advisory role was unanimous\namong the board. Tesla has operational problems that need to be solved and\nif the board thought there was any way that Martin could be part of the\nsolution, then he would still be an employee of the company.\u201d9 These\nstatements were the start of a war that would drag on between the two men\nin public for years and that in many ways continues to the present day.\nAs 2007 played out, the problems mounted for Tesla. The carbon-fiber\nbody that looked so good turned out to be a huge pain to paint, and Tesla\nhad to cycle through a couple of companies to find one that could do the\nwork well. Sometimes there were faults in the battery pack. The motor\nshort-circuited now and again. The body panels had visible gaps. The\ncompany also had to face up to the reality that a two-speed transmission\nwas not going to happen. In order for the Roadster to achieve its flashy\nzero-to-60 times with a single-speed transmission, Tesla\u2019s engineers had to\nredesign the car\u2019s motor and inverter and shave off some weight. \u201cWe\nessentially had to do a complete reboot,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat was terrible.\u201d\nAfter Eberhard was removed as CEO, Tesla\u2019s board tapped Michael\nMarks as its interim chief. Marks had run Flextronics, an enormous", "electronics supplier, and had deep experience with complex manufacturing\noperations and logistics issues. Marks began interrogating various groups at\nthe company to try to figure out their problems and to prioritize the issues\nplaguing the Roadster. He also put in some basic rules like making sure that\npeople all showed up at work at the same time to establish a baseline of\nproductivity\u2014a tricky ask in Silicon Valley\u2019s work anywhere, anytime\nculture. All of these moves were part of the Marks List, a 10-point, 100-day\nplan that included eliminating all faults in the battery packs, getting gaps\nbetween body parts to less than 40 mm, and booking a specified number of\nreservations. \u201cMartin had been falling apart and lacked a lot of the\ndiscipline key for a manager,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cMichael came in and\nevaluated the mess and was a bullshit filter. He didn\u2019t really have a dog in\nthe fight and could say, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think or what you think. This\nis what we should do.\u2019\u201d For a while, Marks\u2019s strategy worked, and the\nengineers at Tesla could once again focus on building the Roadster rather\nthan on internal politics. But then Marks\u2019s vision for the company began to\ndiverge from Musk\u2019s.\nBy this time, Tesla had moved into a larger facility at 1050 Bing Street\nin San Carlos. The bigger building allowed Tesla to bring the battery work\nback in-house from Asia and for it to do some of the Roadster\nmanufacturing, alleviating the supply chain issues. Tesla was maturing as a\ncar company, although its wild-child start-up streak remained well intact.\nWhile strolling around the factory one day, Marks saw a Smart car from\nDaimler on a lift. Musk and Straubel had a small side project going on\naround the Smart car to see what it might be like as an electric vehicle.\n\u201cMichael didn\u2019t know about it, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Who is the CEO here?\u2019\u201d said\nLyons. (The work on the Smart car eventually led to Daimler buying a 10\npercent stake in Tesla.)\nMarks\u2019s inclination was to try to package Tesla as an asset that could be\nsold to a larger car company. It was a perfectly reasonable plan. While\nrunning Flextronics, Marks had overseen a vast, global supply chain and\nknew the difficulties of manufacturing intimately. Tesla must have looked\nborderline hopeless to him at this point. The company could not make its\none product well, was poised to hemorrhage money, and had missed a string\nof delivery deadlines and yet its engineers were still off doing side\nexperiments. Making Tesla look as pretty as possible for a suitor was the\nrational thing to do.", "In just about every other case, Marks would be thanked for his decisive\nplan of action and saving the company\u2019s investors from a big loss. But\nMusk had little interest in polishing up Tesla\u2019s assets for the highest bidder.\nHe\u2019d started the company to put a dent in the automotive industry and force\npeople to rethink electric cars. Instead of doing the fashionable Silicon\nValley thing of \u201cpivoting\u201d toward a new idea or plan, Musk would dig in\ndeeper. \u201cThe product was late and over budget and everything was wrong,\nbut Elon didn\u2019t want anything to do with those plans to either sell the whole\ncompany or lose control through a partnership,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cSo, Elon\ndecided to double down.\u201d\nOn December 3, 2007, Ze\u2019ev Drori replaced Marks as CEO. Drori had\nexperience in Silicon Valley starting a company that made computer\nmemory and selling it to the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Drori\nwas not Musk\u2019s first pick\u2014a top choice had turned down the job because he\ndidn\u2019t want to move from the East Coast\u2014and did not inspire much\nenthusiasm from the Tesla employees. Drori had about fifteen years on the\nyoungest Tesla worker and no connection to this group bonded by suffering\nand toil. He came to be seen more as an executor of Musk\u2019s wishes than as\na commanding, independent CEO.\nMusk began making more public gestures to mitigate the bad press\naround Tesla. He issued statements and did interviews, promising that the\nRoadster would ship to customers in early 2008. He began talking up a car\ncode-named WhiteStar\u2014the Roadster had been code-named DarkStar\u2014that\nwould be a sedan possibly priced around $50,000, and a new factory to\nbuild the machine. \u201cGiven the recent management changes, some\nreassurances are in order regarding Tesla Motors\u2019 future plans,\u201d Musk wrote\nin a blog post. \u201cThe near term message is simple and unequivocal\u2014we are\ngoing to deliver a great sports car next year that customers will love driving.\n. . . My car, production VIN 1, is already off the production line in the UK\nand final preparations are being made for importation.\u201d Tesla held a series\nof town hall meetings with customers where it tried to fess up to its\nproblems in the open, and it started building some showrooms for its car.\nVince Sollitto, the former PayPal executive, visited the Menlo Park\nshowroom and found Musk complaining about the public relations issues\nbut clearly inspired by the product Tesla was building. \u201cHis demeanor\nchanged the moment we got to this display of the motor,\u201d Sollitto said.\nDressed in a leather jacket and slacks, Musk started talking about the", "motor\u2019s properties and then put on a performance worthy of a carnival\nstrongman by lifting the hundred-or-so-pound hunk of metal. \u201cHe picks this\nthing up and wedges it between his two palms,\u201d Sollitto said. \u201cHe\u2019s holding\nit, and he\u2019s shaking and beads of sweat are forming on his forehead. It\nwasn\u2019t so much a display of strength as a physical demonstration of the\nbeauty of the product.\u201d While the customers complained a lot about the\ndelays, they seemed to sense this passion from Musk and share his\nenthusiasm for the product. Only a handful of customers asked for their\nprepayments back.\nTesla employees soon got to witness the same Musk that SpaceX\nemployees had seen for years. When an issue like the Roadster\u2019s faulty\ncarbon-fiber body panels cropped up, Musk dealt with it directly. He flew to\nEngland in his jet to pick up some new manufacturing tools for the body\npanels and personally delivered them to a factory in France to ensure that\nthe Roadster stayed on its production schedule. The days of people being\nambiguous about the Roadster\u2019s manufacturing costs were gone as well.\n\u201cElon got fired up and said we were going to do this intense cost-down\nprogram,\u201d said Popple. \u201cHe gave a speech, saying we would work on\nSaturdays and Sundays and sleep under desks until it got done. Someone\npushed back from the table and argued that everyone had been working so\nhard just to get the car done, and they were ready for a break and to see\ntheir families. Elon said, \u2018I would tell those people they will get to see their\nfamilies a lot when we go bankrupt.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 but I got it. I had\ncome out of a military culture, and you just have to make your objective\nhappen.\u201d Employees were required to meet at 7 A.M. every Thursday\nmorning for bill-of-materials updates. They had to know the price of every\npart and have a cogent plan for getting parts cheaper. If the motor cost\n$6,500 a pop at the end of December, Musk wanted it to cost $3,800 by\nApril. The costs were plotted and analyzed each month. \u201cIf you started\nfalling behind, there was hell to pay,\u201d Popple said. \u201cEveryone could see it,\nand people lost their jobs when they didn\u2019t deliver. Elon has a mind that\u2019s a\nbit like a calculator. If you put a number on the projector that does not make\nsense, he will spot it. He doesn\u2019t miss details.\u201d Popple found Musk\u2019s style\naggressive, but he liked that Musk would listen to a well-argued, analytical\npoint and often change his mind if given a good enough reason. \u201cSome\npeople thought Elon was too tough or hot-tempered or tyrannical,\u201d Popple\nsaid. \u201cBut these were hard times, and those of us close to the operational", "realities of the company knew it. I appreciated that he didn\u2019t sugarcoat\nthings.\u201d\nOn the marketing front, Musk would run daily Google searches for\nnews stories about Tesla. If he saw a bad story, he ordered someone to \u201cfix\nit\u201d even though the Tesla public relations people could do little to sway the\nreporters. One employee missed an event to witness the birth of his child.\nMusk fired off an e-mail saying, \u201cThat is no excuse. I am extremely\ndisappointed. You need to figure out where your priorities are. We\u2019re\nchanging the world and changing history, and you either commit or you\ndon\u2019t.\u201d*\nMarketing people who made grammatical mistakes in e-mails were let\ngo, as were other people who hadn\u2019t done anything \u201cawesome\u201d in recent\nmemory. \u201cHe can be incredibly intimidating at times but doesn\u2019t have a real\nsense for just how imposing he can be,\u201d said one former Tesla executive.\n\u201cWe\u2019d have these meetings and take bets on who was going to get bloodied\nand bruised. If you told him that you made a particular choice because \u2018it\nwas the standard way things had always been done,\u2019 he\u2019d kick you out of a\nmeeting fast. He\u2019d say, \u2018I never want to hear that phrase again. What we\nhave to do is fucking hard and half-assing things won\u2019t be tolerated.\u2019 He\njust destroys you and, if you survive, he determines if he can trust you. He\nhas to understand that you\u2019re as crazy as he is.\u201d This ethos filtered through\nthe entire company, and everyone quickly understood that Musk meant\nbusiness.\nStraubel, while sometimes on the bad end of the critiques, welcomed\nMusk\u2019s hard-charging presence. The five years to get to this point had been\nan enjoyable slog for him. Straubel had transformed from a quiet, capable\nengineer who shuffled around Tesla\u2019s factory floor with his head down into\nthe most crucial member of the technical team. He knew more about the\nbatteries and the electric drivetrain than just about anyone else at the\ncompany. He also began developing a role as a go-between for employees\nand Musk. Straubel\u2019s engineering smarts and work ethic had earned Musk\u2019s\nrespect, and Straubel found that he could deliver difficult messages to Musk\non behalf of other employees. As he would do for years to come, Straubel\nalso proved willing to check his ego at the door. All that mattered was\ngetting the Roadster and the follow-on sedan to market to popularize\nelectric cars, and Musk looked like the best person to make that happen.", "Other employees had enjoyed the thrill of the engineering challenge\nover the past five years but were burnt-out beyond repair. Wright didn\u2019t\nbelieve that an electric car for the masses would ever take off. He left and\nstarted his own company dedicated to making electric versions of delivery\ntrucks. Berdichevsky had been a crucial, do-anything young engineer for\nmuch of Tesla\u2019s existence. Now that the company employed about three\nhundred people, he felt less effective and didn\u2019t relish the idea of suffering\nfor another five years to bring the sedan to market. He would leave Tesla,\nget a couple of degrees from Stanford, and cofound a start-up looking to\nmake a revolutionary new battery that could soon go into electric cars. With\nEberhard gone, Tarpenning found Tesla less fun. He didn\u2019t see eye to eye\nwith Drori and also shied away from the idea of frying his soul to get the\nsedan out. Lyons stuck around longer, which is a minor miracle. At various\npoints, he had led the development of most of the core technology behind\nthe Roadster, including the battery packs, the motor, the power electronics,\nand, yes, the transmission. This meant that for about five years Lyons had\nbeen among Tesla\u2019s most capable employees and the guy constantly in the\ndoghouse for being behind on something and thus holding the rest of the\ncompany up. He suffered through some of Musk\u2019s more colorful tirades\u2014\ndirected either at him or suppliers that had let Tesla down\u2014that included\ntalk of people\u2019s balls being chopped off and other violent or sexual acts.\nLyons also saw an exhausted, stressed-out Musk spit coffee across a\nconference room table because it was cold and then, without a pause,\ndemand that the employees work harder, do more, and mess up less. Like so\nmany people privy to these performances, Lyons came away with no\nillusions about Musk\u2019s personality but with the utmost respect for his vision\nand drive to execute. \u201cWorking at Tesla back then was like being Kurtz in\nApocalypse Now,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the methods or if they\u2019re\nunsound. Just get the job done. It comes from Elon. He listens, asks good\nquestions, is fast on his feet, and gets to the bottom of things.\u201d\nTesla could survive the loss of some of these early hires. Its strong\nbrand had allowed the company to keep recruiting top talent, including\npeople from large automotive companies who knew how to get over the last\nset of challenges blocking the Roadster from reaching customers. But\nTesla\u2019s major issue no longer revolved around effort, engineering, or clever\nmarketing. Heading into 2008, the company was running out of money. The\nRoadster had cost about $140 million to develop, way over the $25 million", "originally estimated in the 2004 business plan. Under normal\ncircumstances, Tesla had probably done enough to raise more funds. These,\nhowever, were not normal times. The big automakers in the United States\nwere charging toward bankruptcy in the middle of the worst financial crisis\nsince the Great Depression. In the midst of all this, Musk needed to\nconvince Tesla\u2019s investors to fork over tens of millions of additional dollars,\nand those investors had to go to their constituents to lay out why this made\nany sense. As Musk put it, \u201cTry to imagine explaining that you\u2019re investing\nin an electric car company, and everything you read about the car company\nsounds like it is shit and doomed and it\u2019s a recession and no one is buying\ncars.\u201d All Musk had to do to dig Tesla out of this conundrum was lose his\nentire fortune and verge on a nervous breakdown.", "8", "PAIN, SUFFERING, AND SURVIVAL\nA\nS HE PREPARED TO BEGIN FILMING IRON MAN IN EARLY 2007,\nthe director Jon Favreau rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once\nbelonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and defense contractor started\nabout eighty years earlier by Howard Hughes. The facility had a series of\ninterlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie. It also\nsupplied Robert Downey Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human\ncreator Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration. Downey felt nostalgic\nlooking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of\ndisrepair. Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of\na big man who shook up industries and did things his own way.\nDowney heard some rumblings about a Hughes-like figure named Elon\nMusk who had constructed his own, modern-day industrial complex about\nten miles away. Instead of visualizing how life might have been for Hughes,\nDowney could perhaps get a taste of the real thing. He set off in March\n2007 for SpaceX\u2019s headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a\npersonal tour from Musk. \u201cMy mind is not easily blown, but this place and\nthis guy were amazing,\u201d Downey said.\nTo Downey, the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware\nstore. Enthusiastic employees were zipping about, fiddling with an\nassortment of machines. Young white-collar engineers interacted with blue-\ncollar assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine\nexcitement for what they were doing. \u201cIt felt like a radical start-up\ncompany,\u201d Downey said. After the initial tour, Downey came away pleased\nthat the sets being hammered out at the Hughes factory did have parallels to\nthe SpaceX factory. \u201cThings didn\u2019t feel out of place,\u201d he said.\nBeyond the surroundings, Downey really wanted a peek inside Musk\u2019s\npsyche. The men walked, sat in Musk\u2019s office, and had lunch. Downey\nappreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety, coder whack job.\nWhat Downey picked up on instead were Musk\u2019s \u201caccessible eccentricities\u201d\nand the feeling that he was an unpretentious sort who could work alongside", "the people in the factory. Both Musk and Stark were the type of men,\naccording to Downey, who \u201chad seized an idea to live by and something to\ndedicate themselves to\u201d and were not going to waste a moment.\nWhen he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that\nFavreau be sure to place a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark\u2019s workshop. On a\nsuperficial level, this would symbolize that Stark was so cool and connected\nthat he could get a Roadster before it even went on sale. On a deeper level,\nthe car was to be placed as the nearest object to Stark\u2019s desk so that it\nformed something of a bond between the actor, the character, and Musk.\n\u201cAfter meeting Elon and making him real to me, I felt like having his\npresence in the workshop,\u201d Downey said. \u201cThey became contemporaries.\nElon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more\nlikely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions\nwith the shamans.\u201d\nAfter Iron Man came out, Favreau began talking up Musk\u2019s role as the\ninspiration for Downey\u2019s interpretation of Tony Stark. It was a stretch on\nmany levels. Musk is not exactly the type of guy who downs scotch in the\nback of a Humvee while part of a military convoy in Afghanistan. But the\npress lapped up the comparison, and Musk started to become more of a\npublic figure. People who sort of knew him as \u201cthat PayPal guy\u201d began to\nthink of him as the rich, eccentric businessman behind SpaceX and Tesla.\nMusk enjoyed his rising profile. It fed his ego and provided some fun.\nHe and Justine bought a house in Bel Air. Their neighbor to one side was\nQuincy Jones, the music producer, and their other neighbor was Joe Francis,\nthe infamous creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Musk and some former\nPayPal executives, having settled their differences, produced Thank You for\nSmoking and used Musk\u2019s jet in the movie. While not a hard-drinking\ncarouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood nightlife and its social scene.\n\u201cThere were just a lot of parties to go to,\u201d said Bill Lee, Musk\u2019s close\nfriend. \u201cElon was neighbors with two quasi-celebrities. Our friends were\nmaking movies and through this confluence of our networks, there was\nsomething to go out and do every night.\u201d In one interview, Musk calculated\nthat his life had become 10 percent playboy and 90 percent engineer.10 \u201cWe\nhad a domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a\nworkplace,\u201d Justine wrote in magazine article. \u201cWe went to black-tie\nfundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood nightclubs, with Paris\nHilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us. When Google cofounder", "Larry Page got married on Richard Branson\u2019s private Caribbean island, we\nwere there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono\npose with swarms of adoring women outside the reception tent.\u201d\nJustine appeared to relish their status even more than Musk. A writer of\nfantasy fiction novels, she kept a blog detailing the couple\u2019s family life and\ntheir adventures on the town. In one entry, Justine had Musk saying that\nhe\u2019d prefer to sleep with Veronica than Betty from the Archie comics and\nthat he\u2019d like to visit a Chuck E. Cheese sometime. In another entry, she\nwrote about meeting Leonardo DiCaprio at a club and having him beg for a\nfree Tesla Roadster, only to be turned down. Justine handed out nicknames\nto oft-occurring characters in the blog, so Bill Lee became \u201cBill the Hotel\nGuy\u201d because he owns a hotel in the Dominican Republic, and Joe Francis\nappeared as \u201cNotorious Neighbor.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine Musk, who keeps to\nhimself, hanging out with someone as ostentatious as Francis, but the men\ngot along well. When Francis took over an amusement park for his birthday,\nMusk attended and then ended up partying at Francis\u2019s house. Justine wrote,\n\u201cE was there for a bit but admitted he also found it \u2018kind of lame\u2019\u2014he\u2019s\nbeen to a couple of parties at NN\u2019s house now and ends up feeling self-\nconscious, \u2018because it just seems like there are always these skeevy guys\nwandering around the house trolling for girls. I don\u2019t want to be seen as one\nof those guys.\u2019\u201d When Francis got ready to buy a Roadster, he stopped by\nthe Musks\u2019 house and handed over a yellow envelope with $100,000 in\ncash.\nFor a while, the blog provided a rare, welcome glimpse into the life of\nan unconventional CEO. Musk seemed charming. The public learned that\nhe bought Justine a nineteenth-century edition of Pride and Prejudice, that\nMusk\u2019s best friends gave him the nickname \u201cElonius,\u201d and that Musk likes\nto place one-dollar wagers on all manner of things\u2014Can you catch herpes\nfrom the Great Barrier Reef? Is it possible to balance two forks with a\ntoothpick?\u2014that he knows he will win. Justine told one story about Musk\ntraveling to Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, to hang out with\nTony Blair and Richard Branson. A photo of the three men appeared later in\nthe press that depicted Musk with a vacant stare. \u201cThis was E\u2019s I\u2019m-\nthinking-about-a-rocket-problem stance, which makes me pretty sure that\nhe had just gotten some kind of bothersome work-related e-mail, and was\nclearly oblivious to the fact that a picture was being taken at all,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cThis is also the reason I get suck [sic] a kick out of it\u2014the spouse the", "camera caught is the exact spouse I encountered, say, last night en route to\nthe bathroom, standing in the hallway frowning with his arms folded.\u201d\nJustine letting the world into the couple\u2019s bathroom should have served as a\nwarning of things to come. Her blog would soon turn into one of Musk\u2019s\nworst nightmares.\nThe press had not run into a guy like Musk for a very long time. His\nshine as an Internet millionaire kept getting, well, shinier thanks to PayPal\u2019s\nongoing success. He also had an element of mystery. There was the weird\nname. And there was the willingness to spend vast sums of money on\nspaceships and electric cars, which came across as a combination of daring,\nflamboyant, and downright flabbergasting. \u201cElon Musk has been called\n\u2018part playboy, part space cowboy,\u2019 an image hardly dispelled by a car\ncollection that has boasted a Porsche 911 Turbo, 1967 Series 1 Jaguar, a\nHamann BMW M5 plus the aforementioned McLaren F1\u2014which he has\ndriven at up to 215mph on a private airstrip,\u201d a British reporter gushed in\n2007. \u201cThen there was the L39 Soviet military jet, which he sold after\nbecoming a father.\u201d The press had picked up on the fact that Musk tended to\ntalk a huge game and then struggle to deliver on his promises in time, but\nthey didn\u2019t much care. The game he talked was so much bigger than anyone\nelse\u2019s that reporters were comfortable giving Musk leeway. Tesla became\nthe darling of Silicon Valley\u2019s bloggers, who tracked its every move and\nwere breathless in their coverage. Similarly, reporters covering SpaceX\nwere overjoyed that a young, feisty company had arrived to needle Boeing,\nLockheed, and, to a large extent, NASA. All Musk had to do was eventually\nbring some of these wondrous things he\u2019d been funding to market.\nWhile Musk put on a good show for the public and press, he\u2019d started to\nget very worried about his businesses. SpaceX\u2019s second launch attempt had\nfailed, and the reports coming in from Tesla kept getting worse. Musk had\nstarted these two adventures with a fortune nearing $200 million and had\nchewed through more than half the money with little to show for it. As each\nTesla delay turned into a PR fiasco, the Musk glow dimmed. People in\nSilicon Valley began to gossip about Musk\u2019s money problems. Reporters\nwho months earlier had been heaping adulation on Musk turned on him.\nThe New York Times picked up on Tesla\u2019s transmission problems.\nAutomotive websites griped that the Roadster might never ship. By the end\nof 2007, things got downright nasty. Valleywag, Silicon Valley\u2019s gossip\nblog, began to take a particular interest in Musk. Owen Thomas, the site\u2019s", "lead writer, dug into the histories of Zip2 and PayPal and played up the\ntimes Musk was ousted as CEO to undermine some of his entrepreneurial\nstreet cred. Thomas then championed the premise that Musk was a master\nmanipulator who played fast and loose with other people\u2019s money. \u201cIt\u2019s\nwonderful that Musk has realized even a small part of his childhood\nfantasies,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cBut he risks destroying his dreams by refusing\nto reconcile them with reality.\u201d Valleywag anointed the Tesla Roadster as its\nNo. 1 fail of 2007 among technology companies.\nAs his businesses and public persona suffered, Musk\u2019s home life\ndegraded as well. His triplets\u2014Kai, Damian, and Saxon\u2014had arrived near\nthe end of 2006 and joined their brothers Griffin and Xavier. According to\nMusk, Justine suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of\nthe triplets. \u201cIn the spring of 2007, our marriage was having real issues,\u201d\nMusk said. \u201cIt was on the rocks.\u201d Justine\u2019s blog posts back up his\nsentiments. She described a much less romantic Musk and felt people\ntreated her as \u201can arm ornament who couldn\u2019t possibly have anything\ninteresting to say\u201d rather than as an author and her husband\u2019s equal. During\none trip to St. Barts, the Musks ended up sharing dinner with some wealthy,\ninfluential couples. When Justine let out her political views, one of the men\nat the table made a crack about her being so opinionated. \u201cE chuckled back,\npatted my hand the way you pat a child\u2019s,\u201d Justine wrote on her blog. From\nthat point on, Justine ordered Musk to introduce her as a published novelist\nand not just his wife and mother of his children. The results? \u201cE\u2019s way of\ndoing this throughout the rest of the trip: \u2018Justine wants me to tell you that\nshe\u2019s written novels,\u2019 which made people look at me like oh, that\u2019s just so\ncute and didn\u2019t really help my case.\u201d\nAs 2007 rolled into 2008, Musk\u2019s life became more tumultuous. Tesla\nbasically had to start over on much of the Roadster, and SpaceX still had\ndozens of people living in Kwajalein awaiting the next launch of the Falcon\n1. Both endeavors were vacuuming up Musk\u2019s money. He started selling off\nprized possessions like the McLaren to generate extra cash. Musk tended to\nshield employees from the gravity of his fiscal situation by always\nencouraging them to do their best work. At the same time, he personally\noversaw all significant purchases at both companies. Musk also trained\nemployees to make the right trade-offs between spending money and\nproductivity. This struck many of the SpaceX employees as a novel idea,\nsince they were used to traditional aerospace companies that had huge,", "multiyear government contracts and no day-to-day survival pressure. \u201cElon\nwould always be at work on Sunday, and we had some chats where he laid\nout his philosophy,\u201d said Kevin Brogan, the early SpaceX employee. \u201cHe\nwould say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that\nwe were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. It was this\nvery entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley way of thinking that none of the\naerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into. Sometimes he\nwouldn\u2019t let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected\nyou to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he\nwouldn\u2019t flinch at renting a plane for ninety thousand dollars to get\nsomething to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it.\nHe would place this urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be\nten million dollars a day and that every day we were slower to achieve our\ngoals was a day of missing out on that money.\u201d\nMusk had become all consumed with Tesla and SpaceX out of necessity,\nand there can be no doubt that this exacerbated the tensions in his marriage.\nThe Musks had a team of nannies to help with their five children, but Elon\ncould not spend much time at home. He worked seven days a week and\nquite often split his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Justine\nneeded a change. During moments of self-reflection, she felt sickened,\nperceiving herself a trophy wife. Justine longed to be Elon\u2019s partner again\nand to feel some of that spark from their early days before life had turned so\ndazzling and demanding. It\u2019s not clear how much Musk let on to Justine\nabout his dwindling bank account. She has long maintained that Musk kept\nher in the dark about the family\u2019s financial arrangements. But some of\nMusk\u2019s closest friends did get a glimpse into the worsening financial\nsituation. In the first half of 2008, Antonio Gracias, the founder and CEO of\nValor Equity, met Musk for dinner. Gracias had been an investor in Tesla\nand had become one of Musk\u2019s closest friends and allies, and he could see\nMusk agonizing over his future. \u201cThings were starting to be difficult with\nJustine, but they were still together,\u201d Gracias said. \u201cDuring that dinner, Elon\nsaid, \u2018I will spend my last dollar on these companies. If we have to move\ninto Justine\u2019s parents\u2019 basement, we\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d\nThe option of moving in with Justine\u2019s parents expired on June 16,\n2008, when Musk filed for divorce. The couple did not disclose the\nsituation right away, although Justine left hints on her blog. In late June, she\nposted a quotation from Moby without any additional context: \u201cThere\u2019s no", "such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they\nwouldn\u2019t try to be a public figure.\u201d The next entry had Justine house\nhunting for undisclosed reasons with Sharon Stone, and a couple of entries\nlater she talked about \u201ca major drama\u201d that she\u2019d been dealing with. In\nSeptember, Justine wrote her first blog post explicitly about the divorce,\nsaying, \u201cWe had a good run. We married young, took it as far as we could\nand now it is over.\u201d Valleywag naturally followed with a story about the\ndivorce and noted that Musk had been seen out with a twenty-something\nactress.\nThe media coverage and divorce freed Justine to write about her private\nlife in a much more liberated way. In the posts that followed, she gave her\naccount of how the marriage ended, her views on Musk\u2019s girlfriend and\nfuture second wife, and the inner workings of the divorce proceedings. For\nthe first time, the public had access to a deeply unpleasant portrayal of\nMusk and received some firsthand accounts\u2014albeit from an ex-wife\u2014of\nhis hardline behavior. The writing may have been biased, but it provided a\nwindow into how Musk operated. Here\u2019s one post about the lead-up to the\ndivorce and its rapid execution:\nDivorce, for me, was like the bomb you set off when all other\noptions have been exhausted. I had not yet given up on the\ndiplomacy option, which was why I hadn\u2019t already filed. We were\nstill in the early stages of marital counseling (three sessions total).\nElon, however, took matters into his own hands\u2014he tends to like to\ndo that\u2014when he gave me an ultimatum: \u201cEither we fix [the\nmarriage] today, or I will divorce you tomorrow.\u201d\nThat night, and again the next morning, he asked me what I\nwanted to do. I stated emphatically that I was not ready to unleash\nthe dogs of divorce; I suggested that \u201cwe\u201d hold off for at least\nanother week. Elon nodded, touched the top of my head, and left.\nLater that same morning I tried to make a purchase and discovered\nthat he had cut off my credit card, which is when I also knew that he\nhad gone ahead and filed (as it was, E did not tell me directly; he\nhad another person do it).\nFor Musk, each online missive from Justine created another public\nrelations crisis that added to the endless stream of issues faced by his", "companies. The image he\u2019d sculpted over the years appeared ready to\ncrumble alongside his businesses. It was a disaster scenario.\nSoon enough, the Musks had achieved celebrity divorce status.\nMainstream outlets joined Valleywag in poring over court filings tied to the\nbreakup, particularly as Justine fought for more money. During the PayPal\ndays, Justine had signed a postnuptial agreement and now argued that she\ndidn\u2019t really have the time or inclination to dig into the ramifications of the\npaperwork. Justine took to her blog in an entry titled \u201cgolddigger,\u201d and said\nshe was fighting for a divorce settlement that would include their house,\nalimony and child support, $6 million in cash, 10 percent of Musk\u2019s Tesla\nstock, 5 percent of Musk\u2019s SpaceX stock, and a Tesla Roadster. Justine also\nappeared on CNBC\u2019s show Divorce Wars and wrote an article for Marie\nClaire titled \u201c\u2018I Was a Starter Wife\u2019: Inside America\u2019s Messiest Divorce.\u201d\nThe public tended to side with Justine during all of this and couldn\u2019t\nquite figure out why a billionaire was fighting his wife\u2019s seemingly fair\nrequests. A major problem for Musk, of course, was that his assets were\nanything but liquid with most of his net worth being tied up in Tesla and\nSpaceX stock. The couple eventually settled with Justine getting the house,\n$2 million in cash (minus her legal fees), $80,000 a month in alimony and\nchild support for seventeen years, and a Tesla Roadster.*\nYears after the settlement, Justine still struggled to speak about her\nrelationship with Musk. During our interview, she broke down in tears\nseveral times and needed moments to compose her thoughts. Musk, she\nsaid, had hidden many things from her during their marriage and ultimately\ntreated her much like a business adversary to be conquered during the\ndivorce. \u201cWe were at war for a while, and when you go to war with Elon,\nit\u2019s pretty brutal,\u201d she said. Well after their marriage ended, Justine\ncontinued to blog about Musk. She wrote about Riley and provided\ncommentary on his parenting. One post gave Musk a hard time for banning\nstuffed animals from the house when their twins turned seven. Asked about\nthis, Justine said, \u201cElon is hard-core. He grew up in a tough culture and\ntough circumstances. He had to become very tough to not only thrive but to\nconquer the world. He doesn\u2019t want to raise soft overprivileged kids with no\ndirection.\u201d Comments like these seemed to indicate that Justine still\nadmired or at least understood Musk\u2019s strong will.*\nIn the weeks after he first filed for divorce in mid-June of 2008, Musk\ntumbled into a deep funk. Bill Lee started to worry about his friend\u2019s mental", "state and, as one of Musk\u2019s more free-spirited friends, wanted to do\nsomething to cheer him up. Now and again, Musk and Lee, an investor,\nwould take trips overseas and mix business and pleasure. The time was\nright for just such a journey, and they set off for London at the start of July.\nThe decompression program began poorly. Musk and Lee visited the\nheadquarters of Aston Martin to see the company\u2019s CEO and get a tour of\nhis factory. The executive treated Musk like an amateur car builder, talking\ndown to him and suggesting that he knew more about electric vehicles than\nanyone else on the planet. \u201cHe was a complete douche,\u201d as Lee put it, and\nthe men did their best to make a hasty exit back to central London. Along\nthe way, Musk had a nagging stomach pain turn severe. At the time, Lee\nwas married to Sarah Gore, the daughter of former vice president Al Gore,\nwho had been a medical student, and so he called her for advice. They\ndecided that Musk might be suffering from appendicitis, and Lee took him\nto a medical clinic in the middle of a shopping mall. When the tests came\nback negative, Lee set to work trying to goad Musk into a night on the\ntown. \u201cElon didn\u2019t want to go out, and I didn\u2019t really, either,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut\nI was like, \u2018No, come on. We\u2019re all the way here.\u2019\u201d\nLee coaxed Musk into going to a club called Whisky Mist, in Mayfair.\nPeople had packed the small, high-end dance spot and Musk wanted to\nleave after ten minutes. The well-connected Lee texted a promoter friend of\nhis, who pulled some strings to get Musk escorted into the VIP area. The\npromoter then reached out to some of his prettiest friends, including a\ntwenty-two-year-old up-and-coming actress named Talulah Riley, and they\nsoon arrived at the club as well. Riley and her two gorgeous friends had\ncome from a charity gala and were in full-length, flowing gowns. \u201cTalulah\nwas in this huge Cinderella thing,\u201d Lee said. Musk and Riley were\nintroduced by people at the club, and he perked at the sight of her dazzling\nfigure.\nMusk and Riley sat at a table with their friends but immediately zeroed\nin on each other. Riley had just hit it big with her portrayal of Mary Bennet\nin Pride and Prejudice and thought of herself as quite the hotshot. The older\nMusk, meanwhile, took on the role of the soft-spoken, sweet engineer. He\nwhipped out his phone and displayed photos of the Falcon 1 and Roadster,\nalthough Riley thought he had just done some work on these projects and\ndidn\u2019t realize he ran the companies building the machines. \u201cI remember\nthinking that this guy probably didn\u2019t get to talk to young actresses a lot and", "that he seemed quite nervous,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI decided to be really nice to\nhim and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that he\u2019d spoken to a lot\nof pretty girls in his life.\u201d* The more Musk and Riley talked, the more Lee\negged them on. It was the first time in weeks that his friend appeared happy.\n\u201cHis stomach didn\u2019t hurt; he\u2019s not bummed, this is great,\u201d Lee said. Despite\nbeing dressed for a fairy tale, Riley didn\u2019t fall in love with Musk at first\nsight. But she did become more impressed and intrigued as the night went\non, particularly after the club promoter introduced Musk to a stunning\nmodel, and he politely said \u201cHello\u201d and then sat right back down with\nRiley. \u201cI figured he couldn\u2019t be all bad after that,\u201d said Riley, who then\nallowed Musk to place his hand on her knee. Musk asked Riley out to\ndinner the next night, and she accepted.\nWith her curvy figure, sultry eyes, and playful good-girl demeanor,\nRiley was a budding film star but didn\u2019t really act the part. She grew up in\nthe idyllic English countryside, went to a top school, and, until a week\nbefore she met Musk, had been living at home with her parents. After the\nnight at Whisky Mist, Riley called her family to tell them about the\ninteresting guy she had met who builds rockets and cars. Her father used to\nhead up the National Crime Squad and went straight to his computer to\nconduct a background check that illuminated Musk\u2019s resume as a married\ninternational playboy with five kids. Riley\u2019s father chided his daughter for\nbeing a fool, but she held out hope that Musk had an explanation and went\nto dinner with him anyway.\nMusk brought Lee to the dinner, and Riley brought her friend Tamsin\nEgerton, also a beautiful actress. Things were cooler throughout the meal as\nthe group dined in a depressingly empty restaurant. Riley waited to see\nwhat Musk would bring up on his own. Eventually, he did announce his five\nsons and his pending divorce. The confession proved enough to keep Riley\ninterested and curious about where things would lead. Following the meal,\nMusk and Riley broke off on their own. They went for a walk through Soho\nand then stopped at Cafe Boheme, where Riley, a lifelong teetotaler, sipped\nan apple juice. Musk kept Riley\u2019s attention, and the romance began in\nearnest.\nThe couple had lunch the next day and then went to the White Cube, a\nmodern art gallery, and then back to Musk\u2019s hotel room. Musk told Riley, a\nvirgin, that he wanted to show her his rockets. \u201cI was skeptical, but he did\nactually show me rocket videos,\u201d she said. Once Musk went back to the", "United States,* they kept in touch via e-mail for a couple of weeks, and\nthen Riley booked a flight to Los Angeles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking\ngirlfriend or anything like that,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI was just having fun.\u201d\nMusk had other ideas. Riley had been in California for just five days\nwhen he made his move as they lay in bed talking in a tiny room at the\nPeninsula hotel in Beverley Hills. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to leave. I\nwant you to marry me.\u2019 I think I laughed. Then, he said, \u2018No. I\u2019m serious.\nI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a ring.\u2019 I said, \u2018We can shake on it if you like.\u2019 And\nwe did. I don\u2019t remember what I was thinking at the time, and all I can say\nis that I was twenty-two.\u201d\nRiley had been a model daughter up to that point, never giving her\nparents much of anything to worry about. She did well at school, had scored\nsome tremendous acting gigs, and had a soft, sweet personality that her\nfriends described as Snow White brought to life. But there she was on the\nhotel\u2019s balcony, informing her parents that she had agreed to marry a man\nfourteen years her senior, who had just filed for divorce from his first wife,\nhad five kids and two companies, and she didn\u2019t even see how she could\npossibly love him after knowing him for a matter of weeks. \u201cI think my\nmother had a nervous breakdown,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut I had always been\nhighly romantic, and it actually didn\u2019t strike me as that strange.\u201d Riley flew\nback to England to gather her things, and her parents flew back with her to\nthe United States to meet Musk, who belatedly asked Riley\u2019s father for his\nblessing. Musk did not have his own house, which left the couple moving\ninto a home that belonged to Musk\u2019s friend the billionaire Jeff Skoll. \u201cI had\nbeen living there a week when this random guy walked in,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\nsaid, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 He said, \u2018I am the homeowner. Who are you?\u2019 I told\nhim, and then he just walked out.\u201d Musk later proposed to Riley again on\nthe balcony of Skoll\u2019s house, unveiling a massive ring. (He has since bought\nher three engagement rings, including the giant first one, an everyday ring,\nand one designed by Musk that has a diamond surrounded by ten\nsapphires.) \u201cI remember him saying, \u2018Being with me was choosing the hard\npath.\u2019 I didn\u2019t quite understand at the time, but I do now. It\u2019s quite hard,\nquite the crazy ride.\u201d\nRiley experienced a baptism by fire. The whirlwind romance had given\nher the impression that she was engaged to a world conquering, jet-setting\nbillionaire. That was true in theory but a murkier proposition in practice. As\nlate July rolled around, Musk could see that he had just enough cash on", "hand to scrape through to the end of the year. Both SpaceX and Tesla would\nneed cash infusions at some point just to pay the employees, and it was\nunclear where that money would come from with the world\u2019s financial\nmarkets in disarray and investments being put on hold. If things had been\ngoing more smoothly at the companies, Musk could have felt more\nconfident about raising money, but they were not. \u201cHe would come home\nevery day, and there would be some calamity,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe was under\nimmense pressure from all quarters. It was horrendous.\u201d\nSpaceX\u2019s third flight from Kwajalein jumped out as Musk\u2019s most\npressing concern. His team of engineers had remained camped out on the\nisland, preparing the Falcon 1 for another run. A typical company would\nfocus just on the task at hand. Not SpaceX. It had shipped the Falcon 1 to\nKwaj in April with one set of engineers and then put another group of\nengineers on a new project to develop the Falcon 9, a nine-engine rocket\nthat would take the place of the Falcon 5 and serve as a possible\nreplacement to the retiring space shuttle. SpaceX had yet to prove it could\nget to space successfully, but Musk kept positioning it to bid on big-ticket\nNASA contracts.*\nOn July 30, 2008, the Falcon 9 had a successful test fire in Texas with\nall nine of its engines lighting up and producing 850,000 pounds of thrust.\nThree days later, in Kwaj, SpaceX\u2019s engineers fueled up the Falcon 1 and\ncrossed their fingers. The rocket had an air force satellite as its payload,\nalong with a couple of experiments from NASA. All told, the cargo\nweighed 375 pounds.\nSpaceX had been making significant changes to its rocket since the last,\nfailed launch. A traditional aerospace company would not have wanted the\nadded risk, but Musk insisted that SpaceX push its technology forward\nwhile at the same time trying to make it work right. Among the biggest\nchanges for the Falcon 1 was a new version of the Merlin 1 engine that\nrelied on a tweaked cooling system.\nThe first launch attempt on August 2, 2008, aborted at T minus zero\nseconds. SpaceX regrouped and tried to launch again the same day. This\ntime everything seemed to be going well. The Falcon 1 soared into the sky\nand flew spectacularly without any indication of a problem. SpaceX\nemployees watching a webcast of the proceedings back in California let out\nhoots and whistles. Then, right at the moment when the first stage and\nsecond stage were to separate, there was a malfunction. An analysis after", "the fact would show that the new engines had delivered an unexpected\nthrust during the separation process that caused the first stage to bump up\ninto the second stage, damaging the top part of the rocket and its engine.*\nThe failed launch left many SpaceX employees shattered. \u201cIt was so\nprofound seeing the energy shift over the room in the course of thirty\nseconds,\u201d said Dolly Singh, a recruiter at SpaceX. \u201cIt was like the worst\nfucking day ever. You don\u2019t usually see grown-ups weeping, but there they\nwere. We were tired and broken emotionally.\u201d Musk addressed the workers\nright away and encouraged them to get back to work. \u201cHe said, \u2018Look. We\nare going to do this. It\u2019s going to be okay. Don\u2019t freak out,\u2019\u201d Singh recalled.\n\u201cIt was like magic. Everyone chilled out immediately and started to focus\non figuring out what just happened and how to fix it. It went from despair to\nhope and focus.\u201d Musk put up a positive front to the public as well. In a\nstatement, he said that SpaceX had another rocket waiting to attempt a\nfourth launch and a fifth launch planned shortly after that. \u201cI have also\ngiven the go-ahead to begin fabrication of flight six,\u201d he said. \u201cFalcon 9\ndevelopment will also continue unabated.\u201d\nIn reality, the third launch was a disaster with cascading consequences.\nSince the second stage of the rocket did not fire properly, SpaceX never got\na chance to see if it had really fixed the fuel-sloshing issues that had\nplagued the second flight. Many of the SpaceX engineers were confident\nthat they had solved this problem and were anxious to get to the fourth\nlaunch, believing that they had an easy answer for the recent thrust problem.\nFor Musk, the situation seemed graver. \u201cI was super depressed,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t solved the slush coupling problem on flight two, or there was\njust some random other thing that occurred\u2014say a mistake in the launch\nprocess or the manufacturing process unrelated to anything previous\u2014then\ngame over.\u201d SpaceX simply did not have enough money to try a fifth flight.\nHe\u2019d put $100 million into the company and had nothing to spare because\nof the issues at Tesla. \u201cFlight four was it,\u201d Musk said. If, however, SpaceX\ncould nail the fourth flight, it would instill confidence on the part of the\nU.S. government and possible commercial customers, paving the way for\nthe Falcon 9 and even more ambitious projects.\nLeading up to the third launch, Musk had been his usual ultra-involved\nself. Anyone at SpaceX who held the launch back went onto Musk\u2019s\ncritical-path shit list. Musk would hound the person responsible about the\ndelays but, typically, he would also do everything in his power to help solve", "problems. \u201cI was personally holding up the launch once and had to give\nElon twice-daily updates about what was going on,\u201d said Kevin Brogan.\n\u201cBut Elon would say, \u2018There are five hundred people at this company. What\ndo you need?\u2019\u201d One of the calls must have taken place while Musk courted\nRiley because Brogan remembered Musk phoning from the bathroom of a\nLondon club to find out how welding had gone on a large part of the rocket.\nMusk fielded another call in the middle of the night while sleeping next to\nRiley and had to whisper as he berated the engineers. \u201cHe\u2019s giving us the\npillow talk voice, so we all have to huddle around the speakerphone, while\nhe tells us, \u2018You guys need to get your shit together,\u2019\u201d Brogan said.\nWith the fourth launch, the demands and anticipation had ratcheted to\nthe point that people started making silly mistakes. Typically, the body of\nthe Falcon 1 rocket traveled to Kwaj via barge. This time Musk and the\nengineers were too excited and desperate to wait for the ocean journey.\nMusk rented a military cargo plane to fly the rocket body from Los Angeles\nto Hawaii and then on to Kwaj. This would have been a fine idea except the\nSpaceX engineers forgot to factor in what the pressurized plane would do to\nthe body of the rocket, which is less than an eighth of an inch thick. As the\nplane started its descent into Hawaii, everyone inside of it could hear\nstrange noises coming from the cargo hold. \u201cI looked back and could see\nthe stage crumpling,\u201d said Bulent Altan, the former head of avionics at\nSpaceX. \u201cI told the pilot to go up, and he did.\u201d The rocket had behaved\nmuch like an empty water bottle will on a plane, with the air pressure\npushing against the sides of the bottle and making it buckle. Altan\ncalculated that the SpaceX team on the plane had about thirty minutes to do\nsomething about the problem before they would need to land. They pulled\nout their pocketknives and cut away the shrink wrap that held the rocket\u2019s\nbody tight. Then they found a maintenance kit on the plane and used\nwrenches to open up some nuts on the rocket that would allow its internal\npressure to match that of the plane\u2019s. When the plane landed, the engineers\ndivvied up the duties of calling SpaceX\u2019s top executives to tell them about\nthe catastrophe. It was 3 A.M. Los Angeles time, and one of the executives\nvolunteered to deliver the horrific news to Musk. The thinking at the time\nwas that it would take three months to repair the damage. The body of the\nrocket had caved in in several places, baffles placed inside the fuel tank to\nstop the sloshing problem had broken, and an assortment of other issues had\nappeared. Musk ordered the team to continue on to Kwaj and sent in a", "reinforcement team with repair parts. Two weeks later, the rocket had been\nfixed inside of the makeshift hangar. \u201cIt was like being stuck in a foxhole\ntogether,\u201d Altan said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to quit and leave the person next\nto you behind. When it was all done, everyone felt amazing.\u201d\nThe fourth and possibly final launch for SpaceX took place on\nSeptember 28, 2008. The SpaceX employees had worked nonstop shifts\nunder agonizing pressure for six weeks to reach this day. Their pride as\nengineers and their hopes and dreams were on the line. \u201cThe people\nwatching back at the factory were trying their best not to throw up,\u201d said\nJames McLaury, a machinist at SpaceX. Despite their past flubs, the\nengineers on Kwaj were confident that this launch would work. Some of\nthese people had spent years on the island going through one of the more\nsurreal engineering exercises in human history. They had been separated\nfrom their families, assaulted by the heat, and exiled on their tiny launchpad\noutpost\u2014sometimes without much food\u2014for days on end as they waited\nfor the launch windows to open and dealt with the aborts that followed. So\nmuch of that pain and suffering and fear would be forgotten if this launch\nwent successfully.\nIn the late afternoon on the twenty-eighth, the SpaceX team raised the\nFalcon 1 into its launch position. Once again, it stood tall, looking like a\nbizarre artifact of an island tribe as palm trees swayed beside it and a\nsmattering of clouds crossed through the spectacular blue sky. By this time,\nSpaceX had upped its webcast game, turning each launch into a major\nproduction both for its employees and the public. Two SpaceX marketing\nexecutives spent twenty minutes before the launch going through all the\ntechnical ins and outs of the launch. The Falcon 1 was not carrying real\ncargo this time; neither the company nor the military wanted to see\nsomething else blow up or get lost at sea, so the rocket held a 360-pound\ndummy payload.\nThe fact that SpaceX had been reduced to launch theater did not faze the\nemployees or dampen their enthusiasm. As the rocket rumbled and then\nclimbed higher, the employees back at SpaceX headquarters let out raucous\ncheers. Each milestone that followed\u2014clearing the island, engine checks\ncoming back good\u2014was again met with whistles and shouts. As the first\nstage fell away, the second stage fired up about ninety seconds into the\nflight and the employees turned downright rapturous, filling the webcast\nwith their ecstatic hollering. \u201cPerfect,\u201d said one of the talking heads. The", "Kestrel engine glowed red and started its six-minute burn. \u201cWhen the\nsecond stage cleared, I could finally start breathing again and my knees\nstopped buckling,\u201d said McLaury.\nThe fairing opened up around the three-minute mark and fell back\ntoward Earth. And, finally, around nine minutes into its journey, the Falcon\n1 shut down just as planned and reached orbit, making it the first privately\nbuilt machine to accomplish such a feat. It took six years\u2014about four and\nhalf more than Musk had once planned\u2014and five hundred people to make\nthis miracle of modern science and business happen.\nEarlier in the day, Musk had tried to distract himself from the mounting\npressure by going to Disneyland with his brother Kimbal and their children.\nMusk then had to race back to make the 4 P.M. launch and walked into\nSpaceX\u2019s trailer control room about two minutes before blastoff. \u201cWhen the\nlaunch was successful, everyone burst into tears,\u201d Kimbal said. \u201cIt was one\nof the most emotional experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d Musk left the control room\nand walked out to the factory floor, where he received a rock star\u2019s\nwelcome. \u201cWell, that was freaking awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of\npeople who thought we couldn\u2019t do it\u2014a lot actually\u2014but as the saying\ngoes, \u2018the fourth time is the charm,\u2019 right? There are only a handful of\ncountries on Earth that have done this. It\u2019s normally a country thing, not a\ncompany thing. . . . My mind is kind of frazzled, so it\u2019s hard for me to say\nanything, but, man, this is definitely one of the greatest days in my life, and\nI think probably for most people here. We showed people we can do it. This\nis just the first step of many. . . . I am going to have a really great party\ntonight. I don\u2019t know about you guys.\u201d Mary Beth Brown then tapped Musk\non the shoulder and pulled him away to a meeting.\nThe afterglow of this mammoth victory faded soon after the party\nended, and the severity of SpaceX\u2019s financial hell became top of mind again\nfor Musk. SpaceX had the Falcon 9 efforts to support and had also\nimmediately green-lighted the construction of another machine\u2014the\nDragon capsule\u2014that would be used to take supplies, and one day humans,\nto the International Space Station. Historically, either project would cost\nmore than $1 billion to complete, but SpaceX would have to find a way to\nbuild both machines simultaneously for a fraction of the cost. The company\nhad dramatically increased the rate at which it hired employees and moved\ninto a much larger headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX had a\ncommercial flight booked to carry a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian", "government, but that launch and the payment for it would not arrive until\nthe middle of 2009. In the meantime, SpaceX simply struggled to make its\npayroll.\nThe press did not know the extent of Musk\u2019s financial woes, but they\nknew enough to turn detailing Tesla\u2019s precarious financial situation into a\nfavored pastime. A website called the Truth About Cars began a \u201cTesla\nDeath Watch\u201d in May 2008 and followed up with dozens of entries\nthroughout the year. The blog took special pleasure in rejecting the idea that\nMusk was a true founder of the company, presenting him as the moneyman\nand chairman who had more or less stolen Tesla from the genius engineer\nEberhard. When Eberhard started a blog detailing the pros and cons of\nbeing a Tesla customer, the auto site was all too happy to echo his gripes.\nTop Gear, a popular British television show, ripped the Roadster apart,\nmaking it look as if the car had run out of juice during a road test. \u201cPeople\njoke about the Tesla Death Watch and all that, but it was harsh,\u201d said\nKimbal Musk. \u201cOne day there were fifty articles about how Tesla will die.\u201d\nThen, in October 2008 (just a couple weeks after SpaceX\u2019s successful\nlaunch), Valleywag appeared on the scene again. First it ridiculed Musk for\nofficially taking over as CEO of Tesla and replacing Drori, on the grounds\nthat Musk had just lucked into his past successes. It followed that by\nprinting a tell-all e-mail from a Tesla employee. The report said that Tesla\nhad just gone through a round of layoffs, shut down its Detroit office, and\nhad only $9 million left in the bank. \u201cWe have over 1,200 reservations,\nwhich manes [sic] we\u2019ve taken multiples of tens of millions of cash from\nour customers and have spent them all,\u201d the Tesla employee wrote.\n\u201cMeanwhile, we only delivered less than 50 cars. I actually talked a close\nfriend of mine into putting down $60,000 for a Tesla Roadster. I cannot\nconscientiously be a bystander anymore and allow my company to deceive\nthe public and defraud our dear customers. Our customers and the general\npublic are the reason Tesla is so loved. The fact that they are being lied to is\njust wrong.\u201d*\nYes, Tesla deserved much of the negative attention. Musk, though, felt\nlike the 2008 climate with the hatred of bankers and the rich had turned him\ninto a particularly juicy target. \u201cI was just getting pistol-whipped,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cThere was a lot of schadenfreude at the time, and it was bad on so\nmany levels. Justine was torturing me in the press. There were always all\nthese negative articles about Tesla, and the stories about SpaceX\u2019s third", "failure. It hurt really bad. You have these huge doubts that your life is not\nworking, your car is not working, you\u2019re going through a divorce and all of\nthose things. I felt like a pile of shit. I didn\u2019t think we would overcome it. I\nthought things were probably fucking doomed.\u201d\nWhen Musk ran through the calculations concerning SpaceX and Tesla,\nit occurred to him that only one company would likely even have a chance\nat survival. \u201cI could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split the money I had\nleft between them,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat was a tough decision. If I split the\nmoney, maybe both of them would die. If I gave the money to just one\ncompany, the probability of it surviving was greater, but then it would mean\ncertain death for the other company. I debated that over and over.\u201d While\nMusk meditated on this, the economy worsened quickly and so too did\nMusk\u2019s financial condition. As 2008 came to an end, Musk had run out of\nmoney.\nRiley began to see Musk\u2019s life as a Shakespearean tragedy. Sometimes\nMusk would open up to her about the issues, and other times he retreated\ninto himself. Riley spied on Musk while he read e-mail and watched him\ngrimace as the bad news poured in. \u201cYou\u2019d witness him having these\nconversations in his head,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to watch someone you\nlove struggle like that.\u201d Because of the long hours that he worked and his\neating habits, Musk\u2019s weight fluctuated wildly. Bags formed under his eyes,\nand his countenance started to resemble that of a shattered runner at the\nback end of an ultra-marathon. \u201cHe looked like death itself,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\nremember thinking this guy would have a heart attack and die. He seemed\nlike a man on the brink.\u201d In the middle of the night, Musk would have\nnightmares and yell out. \u201cHe was in physical pain,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe would\nclimb on me and start screaming while still asleep.\u201d The couple had to start\nborrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Musk\u2019s friend Skoll, and\nRiley\u2019s parents offered to remortgage their house. Musk no longer flew his\njet back and forth between Los Angles and Silicon Valley. He took\nSouthwest.\nBurning through about $4 million a month, Tesla needed to close\nanother major round of funding to get through 2008 and stay alive. Musk\nhad to lean on friends just to try to make payroll from week to week, as he\nnegotiated with investors. He sent impassioned pleas to anyone he could\nthink of who might be able to spare some money. Bill Lee invested $2\nmillion in Tesla, and Sergey Brin invested $500,000. \u201cA bunch of Tesla", "employees wrote checks to keep the company going,\u201d said Diarmuid\nO\u2019Connell, the vice president of business development at Tesla. \u201cThey\nturned into investments, but, at the time, it was twenty-five or fifty thousand\ndollars that you didn\u2019t expect to see again. It just seemed like holy shit, this\nthing is going to crater.\u201d Kimbal had lost most of his money during the\nrecession when his investments bottomed out but sold what he had left and\nput it into Tesla as well. \u201cI was close to bankruptcy,\u201d Kimbal said. Tesla had\nset the prepayments that customers made for the Roadsters aside, but Musk\nnow needed to use that money to keep the company going and soon those\nfunds were gone, too. These fiscal maneuvers worried Kimbal. \u201cI\u2019m sure\nElon would have found a way to make things right, but he definitely took\nrisks that seemed like they could have landed him in jail for using someone\nelse\u2019s money,\u201d he said.\nIn December 2008, Musk mounted simultaneous campaigns to try to\nsave his companies. He heard a rumor that NASA was on the verge of\nawarding a contract to resupply the space station. SpaceX\u2019s fourth launch\nhad put it in a position to receive some of this money, which was said to be\nin excess of $1 billion. Musk reached out through some back channels in\nWashington and found out that SpaceX might even be a front-runner for the\ndeal. Musk began doing everything in his power to assure people that the\ncompany could meet the challenge of getting a capsule to the ISS. As for\nTesla, Musk had to go to his existing investors and ask them to pony up for\nanother round of funding that needed to close by Christmas Eve to avoid\nbankruptcy. To give the investors some measure of confidence, Musk made\na last-ditch effort to raise all the personal funds he could and put them into\nthe company. He took out a loan from SpaceX, which NASA approved, and\nearmarked the money for Tesla. Musk went to the secondary markets to try\nto sell some of his shares in SolarCity. He also seized about $15 million that\ncame through when Dell acquired a data center software start-up called\nEverdream, founded by Musk\u2019s cousins, in which he had invested. \u201cIt was\nlike the fucking Matrix,\u201d Musk said, describing his financial maneuvers.\n\u201cThe Everdream deal really saved my butt.\u201d\nMusk had cobbled together $20 million, and asked Tesla\u2019s existing\ninvestors\u2014since no new investors materialized\u2014to match that figure. The\ninvestors agreed, and on December 3, 2008, they were in the process of\nfinalizing the paperwork for the funding round when Musk noticed a\nproblem. VantagePoint Capital Partners had signed all of the paperwork", "except for one crucial page. Musk phoned up Alan Salzman, VantagePoint\u2019s\ncofounder and managing partner, to ask about the situation. Salzman\ninformed Musk that the firm had a problem with the investment round\nbecause it undervalued Tesla. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an excellent solution then.\nTake my entire portion of the deal. I had a real hard time coming up with\nthe money. Based on the cash we have in the bank right now, we will\nbounce payroll next week. So unless you\u2019ve got another idea, can you either\njust participate as much as you\u2019d like, or allow the round to go through\nbecause otherwise we will be bankrupt.\u2019\u201d Salzman balked and told Musk to\ncome in the following week at 7 A.M. to present to VantagePoint\u2019s top brass.\nNot having a week of time to work with, Musk asked to come in the next\nday, and Salzman refused that offer, forcing Musk to continue taking on\nloans. \u201cThe only reason he wanted the meeting at his office was for me to\ncome on bended knee begging for money so he could say, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Musk\ntheorized. \u201cWhat a fuckhead.\u201d\nVantagePoint declined to speak about this period, but Musk believed\nthat Salzman\u2019s tactics were part of a mission to bankrupt Tesla. Musk feared\nthat VantagePoint would oust him as CEO, recapitalize Tesla, and emerge as\nthe major owner of the carmaker. It could then sell Tesla to a Detroit\nautomaker or focus on selling electric drivetrains and battery packs instead\nof making cars. Such reasoning would have been quite practical from a\nbusiness standpoint but did not match up with Musk\u2019s goals for Tesla.\n\u201cVantagePoint was forcing that wisdom down the throat of an entrepreneur\nwho wanted to do something bigger and bolder,\u201d said Steve Jurvetson, a\npartner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Tesla investor. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re used\nto a CEO buckling, but Elon doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Instead, Musk took another\nhuge risk. Tesla recharacterized the funding as a debt round rather than an\nequity round, knowing that VantagePoint could not interfere with a debt\ndeal. The tricky part of this strategy was that investors like Jurvetson who\nwanted to help Tesla were put in a bind because venture capital firms are\nnot structured to do debt deals, and convincing their backers to alter their\nnormal rules of engagement for a company that could very well go bankrupt\nin a matter of days would be a very tough ask. Knowing this, Musk bluffed.\nHe told the investors that he would take another loan from SpaceX and fund\nthe entire round\u2014all $40 million\u2014himself. The tactic worked. \u201cWhen you\nhave scarcity, it naturally reinforces greed and leads to more interest,\u201d\nJurvetson said. \u201cIt was also easier for us to go back to our firms and say,", "\u2018Here is the deal. Go or no go?\u2019\u201d The deal ended up closing on Christmas\nEve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt. Musk had just a few\nhundred thousand dollars left and could not have made payroll the next day.\nMusk ultimately put in $12 million, and the investment firms put up the\nrest. As for Salzman, Musk said, \u201cHe should be ashamed of himself.\u201d\nAt SpaceX, Musk and the company\u2019s top executives had spent most of\nDecember in a state of fear. According to reports in the press, SpaceX, the\nonetime front-runner for the large NASA contract, had suddenly lost favor\nwith the space agency. Michael Griffin, who had once almost been a\ncofounder of SpaceX, was the head of NASA and had turned on Musk.\nGriffin did not care for Musk\u2019s aggressive business tactics, seeing him as\nborderline unethical. Others have suggested that Griffin ended up being\njealous of Musk and SpaceX.* On December 23, 2008, however, SpaceX\nreceived a shock. People inside NASA had backed SpaceX to become a\nsupplier for the ISS. The company received $1.6 billion as payment for\ntwelve flights to the space station. Staying with Kimbal in Boulder,\nColorado, for the holidays, Musk broke down in tears as the SpaceX and\nTesla transactions processed. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had an opportunity to buy a\nChristmas present for Talulah or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI went running down\nthe fucking street in Boulder, and the only place that was open sold these\nshitty trinkets, and they were about to close. The best thing I could find\nwere these plastic monkeys with coconuts\u2014those \u2018see no evil, hear no evil\u2019\nmonkeys.\u201d\nFor Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk\u2019s friend, the 2008\nperiod told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk\u2019s\ncharacter. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who\nhad lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his\nex-wife and who verged on having his life\u2019s work destroyed. \u201cHe has the\nability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d\nGracias said. \u201cWhat he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone\nelse. He didn\u2019t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.\u201d That\nability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk\u2019s main\nadvantages over other executives and competitors. \u201cMost people who are\nunder that sort of pressure fray,\u201d Gracias said. \u201cTheir decisions go bad. Elon\ngets hyperrational. He\u2019s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions.\nThe harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went", "through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I\u2019ve just never\nseen anything like his ability to take pain.\u201d", "9", "LIFTOFF\nT\nHE FALCON 9 HAS BECOME SPACEX\u2019S WORKHORSE. The rocket\nlooks\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014like a giant white phallus. It stands 224.4 feet tall, is\n12 feet across, and weighs 1.1 million pounds. The rocket is powered by\nnine engines arranged in an \u201coctaweb\u201d pattern at its base with one engine in\nthe center and eight others encircling it. The engines connect to the first\nstage, or the main body of the rocket, which bears the blue SpaceX insignia\nand an American flag. The shorter second stage of the rocket sits on top of\nthe first and is the one that actually ends up doing things in space. It can be\noutfitted with a rounded container for carrying satellites or a capsule\ncapable of transporting humans. By design, there\u2019s nothing particularly\nflashy about the Falcon 9\u2019s outward appearance. It\u2019s the spaceship\nequivalent of an Apple laptop or a Braun kettle\u2014an elegant, purposeful\nmachine stripped of frivolity and waste.\nSpaceX sometimes uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern\nCalifornia to send up these Falcon 9 rockets. Were it not owned by the\nmilitary, the base would be a resort. The Pacific Ocean runs for miles along\nits border, and its grounds have wide-open shrubby fields dotted by green\nhills. Nestled into one hilly spot just at the ocean\u2019s edge are a handful of\nlaunchpads. On launch days, the white Falcon 9 breaks up the blue and\ngreen landscape, pointing skyward and leaving no doubt about its\nintentions.\nAbout four hours before a launch, the Falcon 9 starts getting filled with\nan immense amount of liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene. Some of\nthe liquid oxygen vents out of the rocket as it awaits launch and is kept so\ncold that it boils off on contact with the metal and air, forming white plumes\nthat stream down the rocket\u2019s sides. This gives the impression of the Falcon\n9 huffing and puffing as it limbers up before the journey. The engineers\ninside of SpaceX\u2019s mission control monitor these fuel systems and all\nmanner of other items. They chat back and forth through headsets and begin\ncycling through their launch checklist, consumed by what people in the", "business call \u201cgo fever\u201d as they move from one approval to the next. Ten\nminutes before launch, the humans step out of the way and leave the\nremaining processes up to automated machines. Everything goes quiet, and\nthe tension builds until right before the main event. That\u2019s when, out of\nnowhere, the Falcon 9 breaks the silence by letting out a loud gasp.\nA white latticed support structure pulls away from its body. The T-\nminus-ten-seconds countdown begins. Nothing much happens from ten\ndown to four. At the count of three, however, the engines ignite, and the\ncomputers conduct a last, oh-so-rapid, health check. Four enormous metal\nclamps hold the rocket down, as computing systems evaluate all nine\nengines and measure if there\u2019s sufficient downward force being produced.\nBy the time zero arrives, the rocket has decided that all is well enough to go\nthrough with its mission, and the clamps release. The rocket goes to war\nwith inertia, and then, with flames surrounding its base and snow-thick\nplumes of the liquid oxygen filling the air, it shoots up. Seeing something so\nlarge hold so straight and steady while suspended in midair is hard for the\nbrain to register. It is foreign, inexplicable. About twenty seconds after\nliftoff, the spectators placed safely a few miles away catch the first faceful\nof the Falcon 9\u2019s rumble. It\u2019s a distinct sound\u2014a sort of staccato crackling\nthat arises from chemicals whipped into a violent frenzy. Pant legs vibrate\nfrom shock waves produced by a stream of sonic booms coming out of the\nFalcon 9\u2019s exhaust. The white rocket climbs higher and higher with\nimpressive stamina. After about a minute, it\u2019s just a red spot in the sky, and\nthen\u2014poof\u2014it\u2019s gone. Only a cynical dullard could come away from\nwitnessing this feeling anything other than wonder at what man can\naccomplish.\nFor Elon Musk, this spectacle has turned into a familiar experience.\nSpaceX has metamorphosed from the joke of the aeronautics industry into\none of its most consistent operators. SpaceX sends a rocket up about once a\nmonth, carrying satellites for companies and nations and supplies to the\nInternational Space Station. Where the Falcon 1 blasting off from Kwajalein\nwas the work of a start-up, the Falcon 9 taking off from Vandenberg is the\nwork of an aerospace superpower. SpaceX can undercut its U.S.\ncompetitors\u2014Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences\u2014on price by a\nridiculous margin. It also offers U.S. customers a peace of mind that its\nrivals can\u2019t. Where these competitors rely on Russian and other foreign\nsuppliers, SpaceX makes all of its machines from scratch in the United", "States. Because of its low costs, SpaceX has once again made the United\nStates a player in the worldwide commercial launch market. Its $60 million\nper launch cost is much less than what Europe and Japan charge and trumps\neven the relative bargains offered by the Russians and Chinese, who have\nthe added benefit of decades of sunk government investment into their\nspace programs as well as cheap labor.\nThe United States continues to take great pride in having Boeing\ncompete against Airbus and other foreign aircraft makers. For some reason,\nthough, government leaders and the public have been willing to concede\nmuch of the commercial launch market. It\u2019s a disheartening and\nshortsighted position. The total market for satellites, related services, and\nthe rocket launches needed to carry them to space has exploded over the\npast decade from about $60 billion per year to more than $200 billion.11 A\nnumber of countries pay to send up their own spy, communication, and\nweather satellites. Companies then turn to space for television, Internet,\nradio, weather, navigation, and imaging services. The machines in space\nsupply the fabric of modern life, and they\u2019re going to become more capable\nand interesting at a rapid pace. A whole new breed of satellite makers has\njust appeared on the scene with the ability to answer Google-like queries\nabout our planet. These satellites can zoom in on Iowa and determine when\ncornfields are at peak yields and ready to harvest, and they can count cars in\nWal-Mart parking lots throughout California to calculate shopping demand\nduring the holiday season. The start-ups making these types of innovative\nmachines must often turn to the Russians to get them into space, but\nSpaceX intends to change that.\nThe United States has remained competitive in the most lucrative parts\nof the space industry, building the actual satellites and complementary\nsystems and services to run them. Each year, the United States makes about\none-third of all satellites and takes about 60 percent of the global satellite\nrevenue. The majority of this revenue comes from business done with the\nU.S. government. China, Europe, and Russia account for almost all of the\nremaining satellite sales and launches. It\u2019s expected that China\u2019s role in the\nspace industry will increase, while Russia has vowed to spend $50 billion\non revitalizing its space program. This leaves the United States dealing with\ntwo of its least-favored nations in space matters and doing so without much\nleverage. Case in point: the retirement of the space shuttle made the United\nStates totally dependent on the Russians to get astronauts to the ISS. Russia", "gets to charge $70 million per person for the trip and to cut the United\nStates off as it sees fit during political rifts. At present, SpaceX looks like\nthe best hope of breaking this cycle and giving back to America its ability to\ntake people into space.\nSpaceX has become the free radical trying to upend everything about\nthis industry. It doesn\u2019t want to handle a few launches per year or to rely on\ngovernment contracts for survival. Musk\u2019s goal is to use manufacturing\nbreakthroughs and launchpad advances to create a drastic drop in the cost of\ngetting things to space. Most significant, he\u2019s been testing rockets that can\npush their payload to space and then return to Earth and land with supreme\naccuracy on a pad floating at sea or even their original launchpad. Instead of\nhaving its rockets break apart after crashing into the sea, SpaceX will use\nreverse thrusters to lower them down softly and reuse them. Within the next\nfew years, SpaceX expects to cut its price to at least one-tenth that of its\nrivals. Reusing its rockets will drive the bulk of this reduction and SpaceX\u2019s\ncompetitive advantage. Imagine one airline that flies the same plane over\nand over again, competing against others that dispose of their planes after\nevery flight.* Through its cost advantages, SpaceX hopes to take over the\nmajority of the world\u2019s commercial launches, and there\u2019s evidence that the\ncompany is on its way toward doing just that. To date, it has flown satellites\nfor Canadian, European, and Asian customers and completed about two\ndozen launches. Its public launch manifest stretches out for a number of\nyears, and SpaceX has more than fifty flights planned, which are all\ntogether worth more than $5 billion. The company remains privately owned\nwith Musk as the largest shareholder alongside outside investors including\nventure capital firms like the Founders Fund and Draper Fisher Jurvetson,\ngiving it a competitive ethos its rivals lack. Since getting past its near-death\nexperience in 2008, SpaceX has been profitable and is estimated to be\nworth $12 billion.\nZip2, PayPal, Tesla, SolarCity\u2014they are all expressions of Musk.\nSpaceX is Musk. Its foibles emanate directly from him, as do its successes.\nPart of this comes from Musk\u2019s maniacal attention to detail and\ninvolvement in every SpaceX endeavor. He\u2019s hands-on to a degree that\nwould make Hugh Hefner feel inadequate. Part of it stems from SpaceX\nbeing the apotheosis of the Cult of Musk. Employees fear Musk. They\nadore Musk. The give up their lives for Musk, and they usually do all of this\nsimultaneously.", "Musk\u2019s demanding management style can only flourish because of the\notherworldly\u2014in a literal sense\u2014aspirations of the company. While the rest\nof the aerospace industry has been content to keep sending what look like\nrelics from the 1960s into space, SpaceX has made a point of doing just the\nopposite. Its reusable rockets and reusable spaceships look like true twenty-\nfirst-century machines. The modernization of the equipment is not just for\nshow. It reflects SpaceX\u2019s constant push to advance its technology and\nchange the economics of the industry. Musk does not simply want to lower\nthe cost of deploying satellites and resupplying the space station. He wants\nto lower the cost of launches to the point that it becomes economical and\npractical to fly thousands upon thousands of supply trips to Mars and start a\ncolony. Musk wants to conquer the solar system, and, as it stands, there\u2019s\njust one company where you can work if that sort of quest gets you out of\nbed in the morning.\nIt seems unfathomable, but the rest of the space industry has made space\nboring. The Russians, who dominate much of the business of sending things\nand people to space, do so with decades-old equipment. The cramped Soyuz\ncapsule that takes people to the space station has mechanical knobs and\ncomputer screens that appear unchanged from its inaugural 1966 flight.\nCountries new to the space race have mimicked the antiquated Russian and\nAmerican equipment with maddening accuracy. When young people get\ninto the aerospace industry, they\u2019re forced to either laugh or cry at the state\nof the machines. Nothing sucks the fun out of working on a spaceship like\ncontrolling it with mechanisms last seen in a 1960s laundromat. And the\nactual work environment is as outmoded as the machines. Hotshot college\ngraduates have historically been forced to pick between a variety of slow-\nmoving military contractors and interesting but ineffectual start-ups.\nMusk has managed to take these negatives surrounding the aerospace\nbusiness and turn them into gains for SpaceX. He\u2019s presented the company\nas anything but another aerospace contractor. SpaceX is the hip, forward-\nthinking place that\u2019s brought the perks of Silicon Valley\u2014namely frozen\nyogurt, stock options, speedy decision making, and a flat corporate structure\n\u2014to a staid industry. People who know Musk well tend to describe him\nmore as a general than a CEO, and this is apt. He\u2019s built an engineering\narmy by having the pick of just about anyone in the business that SpaceX\nwants.", "The SpaceX hiring model places some emphasis on getting top marks at\ntop schools. But most of the attention goes toward spotting engineers who\nhave exhibited type A personality traits over the course of their lives. The\ncompany\u2019s recruiters look for people who might excel at robot-building\ncompetitions or who are car-racing hobbyists who have built unusual\nvehicles. The object is to find individuals who ooze passion, can work well\nas part of a team, and have real-world experience bending metal. \u201cEven if\nyou\u2019re someone who writes code for your job, you need to understand how\nmechanical things work,\u201d said Dolly Singh, who spent five years as the\nhead of talent acquisition at SpaceX. \u201cWe were looking for people that had\nbeen building things since they were little.\u201d\nSometimes these people walked through the front door. Other times,\nSingh relied on a handful of enterprising techniques to find them. She\nbecame famous for trawling through academic papers to find engineers with\nvery specific skills, cold-calling researchers at labs and plucking possessed\nengineers out of college. At trade shows and conferences, SpaceX recruiters\nwooed interesting candidates they had spotted with a cloak-and-dagger\nshtick. They would hand out blank envelopes that contained invitations to\nmeet at a specific time and place, usually a bar or restaurant near the event,\nfor an initial interview. The candidates that showed up would discover they\nwere among only a handful of people who been anointed out of all the\nconference attendees. They were immediately made to feel special and\ninspired.\nLike many tech companies, SpaceX subjects potential hires to a gauntlet\nof interviews and tests. Some of the interviews are easygoing chats in which\nboth parties get to feel each other out; others are filled with quizzes that can\nbe quite hard. Engineers tend to face the most rigorous interrogations,\nalthough business types and salesmen are made to suffer, too. Coders who\nexpect to pass through standard challenges have rude awakenings.\nCompanies will typically challenge software developers on the spot by\nasking them to solve problems that require a couple of dozen lines of code.\nThe standard SpaceX problem requires five hundred or more lines of code.\nAll potential employees who make their way to the end of the interview\nprocess then handle one more task. They\u2019re asked to write an essay for\nMusk about why they want to work at SpaceX.\nThe reward for solving the puzzles, acting clever in interviews, and\npenning up a good essay is a meeting with Musk. He interviewed almost", "every one of SpaceX\u2019s first one thousand hires, including the janitors and\ntechnicians, and has continued to interview the engineers as the company\u2019s\nworkforce swelled. Each employee receives a warning before going to meet\nwith Musk. The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty\nseconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and\nworking during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don\u2019t\npanic. That\u2019s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face\nyou. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or\nfully acknowledge your presence. Don\u2019t panic. That\u2019s normal. In due course,\nhe will speak to you. From that point, the tales of engineers who have\ninterviewed with Musk run the gamut from torturous experiences to the\nsublime. He might ask one question or he might ask several. You can be\nsure, though, that he will roll out the Riddle: \u201cYou\u2019re standing on the\nsurface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile\nnorth. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?\u201d One answer\nto that is the North Pole, and most of the engineers get it right away. That\u2019s\nwhen Musk will follow with \u201cWhere else could you be?\u201d The other answer\nis somewhere close to the South Pole where, if you walk one mile south, the\ncircumference of the Earth becomes one mile. Fewer engineers get this\nanswer, and Musk will happily walk them through that riddle and others and\ncite any relevant equations during his explanations. He tends to care less\nabout whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they\ndescribe the problem and their approach to solving it.\nWhen speaking to potential recruits, Singh tried to energize them and be\nup front about the demands of SpaceX and of Musk at the same time. \u201cThe\nrecruiting pitch was SpaceX is special forces,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want as\nhard as it gets, then great. If not, then you shouldn\u2019t come here.\u201d Once at\nSpaceX, the new employees found out very quickly if they were indeed up\nfor the challenge. Many of them would quit within the first few months\nbecause of the ninety-plus-hour workweeks. Others quit because they could\nnot handle just how direct Musk and the other executives were during\nmeetings. \u201cElon doesn\u2019t know about you and he hasn\u2019t thought through\nwhether or not something is going to hurt your feelings,\u201d Singh said. \u201cHe\njust knows what the fuck he wants done. People who did not normalize to\nhis communication style did not do well.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an impression that SpaceX suffers from incredibly high\nturnover, and the company has without question churned through a fair", "number of bodies. Many of the key executives who helped start the\ncompany, however, have hung on for a decade or more. Among the rank-\nand-file engineers, most people stay on for at least five years to have their\nstock options vest and to see their projects through. This is typical behavior\nfor any technology company. SpaceX and Musk also seem to inspire an\nunusual level of loyalty. Musk has managed to conjure up that Steve Jobs\u2013\nlike zeal among his troops. \u201cHis vision is so clear,\u201d Singh said. \u201cHe almost\nhypnotizes you. He gives you the crazy eye, and it\u2019s like, yes, we can get to\nMars.\u201d Take that a bit further and you arrive at a pleasure-pain,\nsadomasochistic vibe that comes with working for Musk. Numerous people\ninterviewed for this book decried the work hours, Musk\u2019s blunt style, and\nhis sometimes ludicrous expectations. Yet almost every person\u2014even those\nwho had been fired\u2014still worshipped Musk and talked about him in terms\nusually reserved for superheroes or deities.\nSpaceX\u2019s original headquarters in El Segundo were not quite up to the\ncompany\u2019s desired image as a place where the cool kids want to work. This\nis not a problem for SpaceX\u2019s new facility in Hawthorne. The building\u2019s\naddress is 1 Rocket Road, and it has the Hawthorne Municipal Airport and\nseveral tooling and manufacturing companies as neighbors. While the\nSpaceX building resembles the others in size and shape, its all-white color\nmakes it the obvious outlier. The structure looks like a gargantuan,\nrectangular glacier that\u2019s been planted in the midst of a particularly soulless\nportion of Los Angeles County\u2019s sprawl.\nVisitors to SpaceX have to walk past a security guard and through a\nsmall executive parking lot where Musk parks his black Model S, which\nflanks the building\u2019s entryway. The front doors are reflective and hide\nwhat\u2019s on the inside, which is more white. There are white walls in the\nfoyer, a funky white table in the waiting area, and a white check-in desk\nwith a pair of orchids sitting in white pots. After going through the\nregistration process, guests are given a name badge and led into the main\nSpaceX office space. Musk\u2019s cubicle\u2014a supersize unit\u2014sits to the right\nwhere he has a couple of celebratory Aviation Week magazine covers up on\nthe wall, pictures of his boys, next to a huge flat-screen monitor, and\nvarious knickknacks on his desk, including a boomerang, some books, a\nbottle of wine, and a giant samurai sword named Lady Vivamus, which\nMusk received when he won the Heinlein Prize, an award given for big\nachievements in commercial space. Hundreds of other people work in", "cubicles amid the big, wide-open area, most of them executives, engineers,\nsoftware developers, and salespeople tapping away on their computers. The\nconference rooms that surround their desks all have space-themed names\nlike Apollo or Wernher von Braun and little nameplates that explain the\nlabel\u2019s significance. The largest conference rooms have ultramodern chairs\n\u2014high-backed, sleek red jobs that surround large glass tables\u2014while\npanoramic photos of a Falcon 1 taking off from Kwaj or the Dragon capsule\ndocking with the ISS hang on the walls in the background.\nTake away the rocket swag and the samurai sword and this central part\nof the SpaceX office looks just like what you might find at your run-of-the-\nmill Silicon Valley headquarters. The same thing cannot be said for what\nvisitors encounter as they pass through a pair of double doors into the heart\nof the SpaceX factory.\nThe 550,000-square-foot factory floor is difficult to process at first\nglance. It\u2019s one continuous space with grayish epoxied floors, white walls,\nand white support columns. A small city\u2019s worth of stuff\u2014people,\nmachines, noise\u2014has been piled into this area. Just near the entryway, one\nof the Dragon capsules that has gone to the ISS and returned to Earth hangs\nfrom the ceiling with black burn marks running down its side. Just under the\ncapsule on the ground are a pair of the twenty-five-foot-long landing legs\nbuilt by SpaceX to let the Falcon rocket come to a gentle rest on the ground\nafter a flight so it can be flown again. To the left side of this entryway area\nthere\u2019s a kitchen, and to the right side there\u2019s the mission control room. It\u2019s\na closed-off area with expansive glass windows and fronted by wall-size\nscreens for tracking a rocket\u2019s progress. It has four rows of desks with about\nten computers each for the mission control staff. Step a bit farther into the\nfactory and there are a handful of industrial work areas separated from each\nother in the most informal of ways. In some spots there are blue lines on the\nfloor to mark off an area and in other spots blue workbenches have been\narranged in squares to cordon off the space. It\u2019s a common sight to have one\nof the Merlin engines raised up in the middle of one of these work areas\nwith a half dozen technicians wiring it up and tuning its bits and pieces.\nJust behind these workspaces is a glass-enclosed square big enough to\nfit two of the Dragon capsules. This is a clean room where people must\nwear lab coats and hairnets to fiddle with the capsules without\ncontaminating them. About forty feet to the left, there are several Falcon 9\nrockets lying next to each other horizontally that have been painted and", "await transport. There are some areas tucked in between all of this that have\nblue walls and appear to have been covered by fabric. These are top-secret\nzones where SpaceX might be working on a fanciful astronaut\u2019s outfit or\nrocket part that it has to hide from visitors and employees not tied to the\nprojects. There\u2019s a large area off to the side where SpaceX builds all of its\nelectronics, another area for creating specialized composite materials, and\nanother for making the bus-sized fairings that wrap around the satellites.\nHundreds of people move about at the same time through the factory\u2014a\nmix of gritty technicians with tattoos and bandanas, and young, white-collar\nengineers. The sweaty smell of kids who have just come off the playground\npermeates the building and hints at its nonstop activity.\nMusk has left his personal touches throughout the factory. There are\nsmall things like the data center that has been bathed in blue lights to give it\na sci-fi feel. The refrigerator-sized computers under the lights have been\nlabeled with big block letters to make it look like they were made by\nCyberdyne Systems, the fictional company from the Terminator movie\nfranchise. Near the elevators, Musk has placed a glowing life-size Iron Man\nfigure. Surely the factory\u2019s most Muskian element is the office space that\nhas been built smack-dab in its center. This is a three-story glass structure\nwith meeting rooms and desks that rises up between various welding and\nconstruction areas. It looks and feels bizarre to have a see-through office\ninside this hive of industry. Musk, though, wanted his engineers to watch\nwhat was going on with the machines at all times and to make sure they had\nto walk through the factory and talk to the technicians on the way to their\ndesks.\nThe factory is a temple devoted to what SpaceX sees as its major\nweapon in the rocket-building game, in-house manufacturing. SpaceX\nmanufactures between 80 percent and 90 percent of its rockets, engines,\nelectronics, and other parts. It\u2019s a strategy that flat-out dumbfounds\nSpaceX\u2019s competitors, like United Launch Alliance, or ULA, which openly\nbrags about depending on more than 1,200 suppliers to make its end\nproducts. (ULA, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, sees\nitself as an engine of job creation rather than a model of inefficiency.)\nA typical aerospace company comes up with the list of parts that it\nneeds for a launch system and then hands off their design and specifications\nto myriad third parties who then actually build the hardware. SpaceX tends\nto buy as little as possible to save money and because it sees depending on", "suppliers\u2014especially foreign ones\u2014as a weakness. This approach comes\noff as excessive at first blush. Companies have made things like radios and\npower distribution units for decades. Reinventing the wheel for every\ncomputer and machine on a rocket could introduce more chances for error\nand, in general, be a waste of time. But for SpaceX, the strategy works. In\naddition to building its own engines, rocket bodies, and capsules, SpaceX\ndesigns its own motherboards and circuits, sensors to detect vibrations,\nflight computers, and solar panels. Just by streamlining a radio, for instance,\nSpaceX\u2019s engineers have found that they can reduce the weight of the\ndevice by about 20 percent. And the cost savings for a homemade radio are\ndramatic, dropping from between $50,000 to $100,000 for the industrial-\ngrade equipment used by aerospace companies to $5,000 for SpaceX\u2019s unit.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe these kinds of price differentials at first, but there are\ndozens if not hundreds of places where SpaceX has secured such savings.\nThe equipment at SpaceX tends to be built out of readily available\nconsumer electronics as opposed to \u201cspace grade\u201d equipment used by others\nin the industry. SpaceX has had to work for years to prove to NASA that\nstandard electronics have gotten good enough to compete with the more\nexpensive, specialized gear trusted in years past. \u201cTraditional aerospace has\nbeen doing things the same way for a very, very long time,\u201d said Drew\nEldeen, a former SpaceX engineer. \u201cThe biggest challenge was convincing\nNASA to give something new a try and building a paper trail that showed\nthe parts were high enough quality.\u201d To prove that it\u2019s making the right\nchoice to NASA and itself, SpaceX will sometimes load a rocket with both\nthe standard equipment and prototypes of its own design for testing during\nflight. Engineers then compare the performance characteristics of the\ndevices. Once a SpaceX design equals or outperforms the commercial\nproducts, it becomes the de facto hardware.\nThere have also been numerous times when SpaceX has done\npioneering work on advancing very complex hardware systems. A classic\nexample of this is one of the factory\u2019s weirder-looking contraptions, a two-\nstory machine designed to perform what\u2019s known as friction stir welding.\nThe machine allows SpaceX to automate the welding process for massive\nsheets of metal like the ones that make up the bodies of the Falcon rockets.\nAn arm takes one of the rocket\u2019s body panels, lines it up against another\nbody panel, and then joins them together with a weld that could run twenty\nfeet or more. Aerospace companies typically try to avoid welds whenever", "possible because they create weaknesses in the metal, and that\u2019s limited the\nsize of metal sheets they can use and forced other design constraints. From\nthe early days of SpaceX, Musk pushed the company to master friction stir\nwelding, in which a spinning head is smashed at high speeds into the join\nbetween two pieces of metal in a bid to make their crystalline structures\nmerge. It\u2019s as if you heated two sheets of aluminum foil and then joined\nthem by putting your thumb down on the seam and twisting the metal\ntogether. This type of welding tends to result in much stronger bonds than\ntraditional welds. Companies had performed friction stir welding before but\nnot on structures as large as a rocket\u2019s body or to the degree to which\nSpaceX has used the technique. As a result of its trials and errors, SpaceX\ncan now join large, thin sheets of metal and shave hundreds of pounds off\nthe weight of the Falcon rockets, as it\u2019s able to use lighter-weight alloys and\navoid using rivets, fasteners, and other support structures. Musk\u2019s\ncompetitors in the auto industry might soon need to do the same because\nSpaceX has transferred some of the equipment and techniques to Tesla. The\nhope is that Tesla will be able to make lighter, stronger cars.\nThe technology has proven so valuable that SpaceX\u2019s competitors have\nstarted to copy it and have tried to poach some of the company\u2019s experts in\nthe field. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos\u2019s secretive rocket company, has been\nparticularly aggressive, hiring away Ray Miryekta, one of the world\u2019s\nforemost friction stir welding experts and igniting a major rift with Musk.\n\u201cBlue Origin does these surgical strikes on specialized talent* offering like\ndouble their salaries. I think it\u2019s unnecessary and a bit rude,\u201d Musk said.\nWithin SpaceX, Blue Origin is mockingly referred to as BO and at one\npoint the company created an e-mail filter to detect messages with \u201cblue\u201d\nand \u201corigin\u201d to block the poaching. The relationship between Musk and\nBezos has soured, and they no longer chat about their shared ambition of\ngetting to Mars. \u201cI do think Bezos has an insatiable desire to be King\nBezos,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHe has a relentless work ethic and wants to kill\neverything in e-commerce. But he\u2019s not the most fun guy, honestly.\u201d*\nIn the early days of SpaceX, Musk knew little about the machines and\namount of grunt work that goes into making rockets. He rebuffed requests\nto buy specialized tooling equipment, until the engineers could explain in\nclear terms why they needed certain things and until experience taught him\nbetter. Musk also had yet to master some of the management techniques for\nwhich he would become both famous and to some degree infamous.", "Musk\u2019s growth as a CEO and rocket expert occurred alongside\nSpaceX\u2019s maturation as a company. At the start of the Falcon 1 journey,\nMusk was a forceful software executive trying to learn some basic things\nabout a very different world. At Zip2 and PayPal, he felt comfortable\nstanding up for his positions and directing teams of coders. At SpaceX, he\nhad to pick things up on the job. Musk initially relied on textbooks to form\nthe bulk of his rocketry knowledge. But as SpaceX hired one brilliant\nperson after another, Musk realized he could tap into their stores of\nknowledge. He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to\nwork grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. \u201cI thought at\nfirst that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,\u201d said Kevin\nBrogan, one of the early engineers. \u201cThen I realized he was trying to learn\nthings. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you\nknow.\u201d People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his\nabilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless\nrecall. It\u2019s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to\nwork just as well in the present day as it did when he was a child\nvacuuming books into his brain. After a couple of years running SpaceX,\nMusk had turned into an aerospace expert on a level that few technology\nCEOs ever approach in their respective fields. \u201cHe was teaching us about\nthe value of time, and we were teaching him about rocketry,\u201d Brogan said.\nIn regards to time, Musk may well set more aggressive delivery targets\nfor very difficult-to-make products than any executive in history. Both his\nemployees and the public have found this to be one of the more jarring\naspects of Musk\u2019s character. \u201cElon has always been optimistic,\u201d Brogan\nsaid. \u201cThat\u2019s the nice word. He can be a downright liar about when things\nneed to get done. He will pick the most aggressive time schedule\nimaginable assuming everything goes right, and then accelerate it by\nassuming that everyone can work harder.\u201d\nMusk has been pilloried by the press for setting and then missing\nproduct delivery dates. It\u2019s one of the habits that got him in the most trouble\nas SpaceX and Tesla tried to bring their first products to market. Time and\nagain, Musk found himself making a public appearance where he had to\ncome up with a new batch of excuses for a delay. Reminded about the initial\n2003 target date to fly the Falcon 1, Musk acted shocked. \u201cAre you\nserious?\u201d he said. \u201cWe said that? Okay, that\u2019s ridiculous. I think I just didn\u2019t\nknow what the hell I was talking about. The only thing I had prior", "experience in was software, and, yeah, you can write a bunch of software\nand launch a website in a year. No problem. This isn\u2019t like software. It\ndoesn\u2019t work that way with rockets.\u201d Musk simply cannot help himself.\nHe\u2019s an optimist by nature, and it can feel like he makes calculations for\nhow long it will take to do something based on the idea that things will\nprogress without flaw at every step and that all the members of his team\nhave Muskian abilities and work ethics. As Brogan joked, Musk might\nforecast how long a software project will take by timing the amount of\nseconds needed physically to write a line of code and then extrapolating that\nout to match however many lines of code he expects the final piece of\nsoftware to be. It\u2019s an imperfect analogy but one that does not seem that far\noff from Musk\u2019s worldview. \u201cEverything he does is fast,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cHe\npees fast. It\u2019s like a fire hose\u2014three seconds and out. He\u2019s authentically in a\nhurry.\u201d\nAsked about his approach, Musk said,\nI certainly don\u2019t try to set impossible goals. I think impossible\ngoals are demotivating. You don\u2019t want to tell people to go through a\nwall by banging their head against it. I don\u2019t ever set intentionally\nimpossible goals. But I\u2019ve certainly always been optimistic on time\nframes. I\u2019m trying to recalibrate to be a little more realistic.\nI don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s just like 100 of me or something like that.\nI mean, in the case of the early SpaceX days, it would have been just\nthe lack of understanding of what it takes to develop a rocket. In that\ncase I was off by, say, 200 percent. I think future programs might be\noff by anywhere from like 25 percent to 50 percent as opposed to\n200 percent.\nSo, I think generally you do want to have a timeline where,\nbased on everything you know about, the schedule should be X, and\nyou execute towards that, but with the understanding that there will\nbe all sorts of things that you don\u2019t know about that you will\nencounter that will push the date beyond that. It doesn\u2019t mean that\nyou shouldn\u2019t have tried to aim for that date from the beginning\nbecause aiming for something else would have been an arbitrary\ntime increase.\nIt\u2019s different to say, \u201cWell, what do you promise people?\u201d\nBecause you want to try to promise people something that includes", "schedule margin. But in order to achieve the external promised\nschedule, you\u2019ve got to have an internal schedule that\u2019s more\naggressive than that. Sometimes you still miss the external schedule.\nSpaceX, by the way, is not alone here. Being late is par for the\ncourse in the aerospace industry. It\u2019s not a question of if it\u2019s late, it\u2019s\nhow late will the program be. I don\u2019t think an aerospace program\nhas been completed on time since bloody World War II.\nDealing with the epically aggressive schedules and Musk\u2019s expectations\nhas required SpaceX\u2019s engineers to develop a variety of survival techniques.\nMusk often asks for highly detailed proposals for how projects will be\naccomplished. The employees have learned never to break the time needed\nto accomplish something down into months or weeks. Musk wants day-by-\nday and hour-by-hour forecasts and sometimes even minute-by-minute\ncountdowns, and the fallout from missed schedules is severe. \u201cYou had to\nput in when you would go to the bathroom,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Elon,\nsometimes people need to take a long dump.\u2019\u201d SpaceX\u2019s top managers work\ntogether to, in essence, create fake schedules that they know will please\nMusk but that are basically impossible to achieve. This would not be such a\nhorrible situation if the targets were kept internal. Musk, however, tends to\nquote these fake schedules to customers, unintentionally giving them false\nhope. Typically, it falls to Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president, to clean\nup the resulting mess. She will either need to ring up a customer to give\nthem a more realistic timeline or concoct a litany of excuses to explain\naway the inevitable delays. \u201cPoor Gwynne,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cJust to hear her\non the phone with the customers is agonizing.\u201d\nThere can be no question that Musk has mastered the art of getting the\nmost out of his employees. Interview three dozen SpaceX engineers and\neach one of them will have picked up on a managerial nuance that Musk has\nused to get people to meet his deadlines. One example from Brogan: Where\na typical manager may set the deadline for the employee, Musk guides his\nengineers into taking ownership of their own delivery dates. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t\nsay, \u2018You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.,\u2019\u201d Brogan said. \u201cHe says, \u2018I\nneed the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?\u2019 Then, when\nyou say yes, you are not working hard because he told you to. You\u2019re\nworking hard for yourself. It\u2019s a distinction you can feel. You have signed\nup to do your own work.\u201d And by recruiting hundreds of bright, self-", "motivated people, SpaceX has maximized the power of the individual. One\nperson putting in a sixteen-hour day ends up being much more effective\nthan two people working eight-hour days together. The individual doesn\u2019t\nhave to hold meetings, reach a consensus, or bring other people up to speed\non a project. He just keeps working and working and working. The ideal\nSpaceX employee is someone like Steve Davis, the director of advanced\nprojects at SpaceX. \u201cHe\u2019s been working sixteen hours a day every day for\nyears,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cHe gets more done than eleven people working\ntogether.\u201d\nTo find Davis, Musk called a teaching assistant* in Stanford\u2019s\naeronautics department and asked him if there were any hardworking,\nbright master\u2019s and doctoral candidates who didn\u2019t have families. The TA\npointed Musk to Davis, who was pursuing a master\u2019s degree in aerospace\nengineering to add to degrees in finance, mechanical engineering, and\nparticle physics. Musk called Davis on a Wednesday and offered him a job\nthe following Friday. Davis was the twenty-second SpaceX hire and has\nended up the twelfth most senior person still at the company. He turned\nthirty-five in 2014.\nDavis did his tour of duty on Kwaj and considered it the greatest time of\nhis life. \u201cEvery night, you could either sleep by the rocket in this tent shelter\nwhere the geckos crawled all over you or take this one-hour boat ride that\nmade you seasick back to the main island,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery night, you had\nto pick the pain that you remembered least. You got so hot and exhausted. It\nwas just amazing.\u201d After working on the Falcon 1, Davis moved to the\nFalcon 9 and then Dragon.\nThe Dragon capsule took SpaceX four years to design. It\u2019s likely the\nfastest project of its ilk done in the history of the aerospace industry. The\nproject started with Musk and a handful of engineers, most of them under\nthirty years old, and peaked at one hundred people.* They cribbed from past\ncapsule work and read over every paper published by NASA and other\naeronautics bodies around projects like Gemini and Apollo. \u201cIf you go\nsearch for something like Apollo\u2019s reentry guidance algorithm, there are\nthese great databases that will just spit out the answer,\u201d Davis said. The\nengineers at SpaceX then had to figure out how to advance these past efforts\nand bring the capsule into the modern age. Some of the areas of\nimprovement were obvious and easily accomplished, while others required\nmore ingenuity. Saturn 5 and Apollo had colossal computing bays that", "produced only a fraction of the computer horsepower that can be achieved\ntoday on, say, an iPad. The SpaceX engineers knew they could save a lot of\nroom by cutting out some of the computers while also adding capabilities\nwith their more powerful equipment. The engineers decided that while\nDragon would look a lot like Apollo, it would have steeper wall angles, to\nclear space for gear and for the astronauts that the company hoped to fly.\nSpaceX also got the recipe for its heat shield material, called PICA, through\na deal with NASA. The SpaceX engineers found out how to make the PICA\nmaterial less expensively and improved the underlying recipe so that\nDragon\u2014from day one\u2014could withstand the heat of a reentry coming back\nfrom Mars.* The total cost for Dragon came in at $300 million, which\nwould be on the order of 10 to 30 times less than capsule projects built by\nother companies. \u201cThe metal comes in, we roll it out, weld it, and make\nthings,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe build almost everything in-house. That is why the\ncosts have come down.\u201d\nDavis, like Brogan and plenty of other SpaceX engineers, has had Musk\nask for the seemingly impossible. His favorite request dates back to 2004.\nSpaceX needed an actuator that would trigger the gimbal action used to\nsteer the upper stage of Falcon 1. Davis had never built a piece of hardware\nbefore in his life and naturally went out to find some suppliers who could\nmake an electromechanical actuator for him. He got a quote back for\n$120,000. \u201cElon laughed,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe said, \u2018That part is no more\ncomplicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand\ndollars. Go make it work.\u2019\u201d Davis spent nine months building the actuator.\nAt the end of the process, he toiled for three hours writing an e-mail to\nMusk covering the pros and cons of the device. The e-mail went into gory\ndetail about how Davis had designed the part, why he had made various\nchoices, and what its cost would be. As he pressed send, Davis felt anxiety\nsurge through his body knowing that he\u2019d given his all for almost a year to\ndo something an engineer at another aerospace company would not even\nattempt. Musk rewarded all of this toil and angst with one of his standard\nresponses. He wrote back, \u201cOk.\u201d The actuator Davis designed ended up\ncosting $3,900 and flew with Falcon 1 into space. \u201cI put every ounce of\nintellectual capital I had into that e-mail and one minute later got that\nsimple response,\u201d Davis said. \u201cEveryone in the company was having that\nsame experience. One of my favorite things about Elon is his ability to\nmake enormous decisions very quickly. That is still how it works today.\u201d", "Kevin Watson can attest to that. He arrived at SpaceX in 2008 after\nspending twenty-four years at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Watson\nworked on a wide variety of projects at JPL, including building and testing\ncomputing systems that could withstand the harsh conditions of space. JPL\nwould typically buy expensive, specially toughened computers, and this\nfrustrated Watson. He daydreamed about ways to handcraft much cheaper,\nequally effective computers. While having his job interview with Musk,\nWatson learned that SpaceX needed just this type of thinking. Musk wanted\nthe bulk of a rocket\u2019s computing systems to cost no more than $10,000. It\nwas an insane figure by aerospace industry standards, where the avionics\nsystems for a rocket typically cost well over $10 million. \u201cIn traditional\naerospace, it would cost you more than ten thousand dollars just for the\nfood at a meeting to discuss the cost of the avionics,\u201d Watson said.\nDuring the job interview, Watson promised Musk that he could do the\nimprobable and deliver the $10,000 avionics system. He began working on\nmaking the computers for Dragon right after being hired. The first system\nwas called CUCU, pronounced \u201ccuckoo.\u201d This communications box would\ngo inside the International Space Station and communicate back with\nDragon. A number of people at NASA referred to the SpaceX engineers as\n\u201cthe guys in the garage\u201d and were cynical about the start-up\u2019s ability to do\nmuch of anything, including building this type of machine. But SpaceX\nproduced the communication computer in record time, and it ended up as\nthe first system of its kind to pass NASA\u2019s protocol tests on the first try.\nNASA officials were forced to say \u201ccuckoo\u201d over and over again during\nmeetings\u2014a small act of defiance SpaceX had planned all along to torture\nNASA. As the months went on, Watson and other engineers built out the\ncomplete computing systems for Dragon and then adapted the technology\nfor Falcon 9. The result was a fully redundant avionics platform that used a\nmix of off-the-shelf computing gear and products built in-house by SpaceX.\nIt cost a bit more than $10,000 but came close to meeting Musk\u2019s goal.\nSpaceX reinvigorated Watson, who had become disenchanted with\nJPL\u2019s acceptance of wasteful spending and bureaucracy. Musk had to sign\noff on every expenditure over $10,000. \u201cIt was his money that we were\nspending, and he was keeping an eye on it, as he damn well should,\u201d\nWatson said. \u201cHe made sure nothing stupid was happening.\u201d Decisions\nwere made quickly during weekly meetings, and the entire company bought\ninto them. \u201cIt was amazing how fast people would adapt to what came out", "of those meetings,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThe entire ship could turn ninety degrees\ninstantly. Lockheed Martin could never do anything like that.\u201d Watson\ncontinued:\nElon is brilliant. He\u2019s involved in just about everything. He\nunderstands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very\nquickly not to go give him a gut reaction. He wants answers that get\ndown to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands\nreally well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like\nnobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy. He\ncan get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can\nmake the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve\nall these equations in real time. It\u2019s amazing to watch the amount of\nknowledge he has accumulated over the years. I don\u2019t want to be the\nperson who ever has to compete with Elon. You might as well leave\nthe business and find something else fun to do. He will outmaneuver\nyou, outthink you, and out-execute you.\nOne of Watson\u2019s top discoveries at SpaceX was the test bed on the third\nfloor of the Hawthorne factory. SpaceX has test versions of all the hardware\nand electronics that go into a rocket laid out on metal tables. It has in effect\nreplicated the innards of a rocket end to end in order to run thousands of\nflight simulations. Someone \u201claunches\u201d the rocket from a computer and\nthen every piece of mechanical and computing hardware is monitored with\nsensors. An engineer can tell a valve to open, then check to see if it opened,\nhow quickly it opened, and the level of current running to it. This testing\napparatus lets SpaceX engineers practice ahead of launches and figure out\nhow they would deal with all manner of anomalies. During the actual\nflights, SpaceX has people in the test facility who can replicate errors seen\non Falcon or Dragon and make adjustments accordingly. SpaceX has made\nnumerous changes on the fly with this system. In one case someone spotted\nan error in a software file in the hours right before a launch. SpaceX\u2019s\nengineers changed the file, checked how it affected the test hardware, and,\nwhen no problems were detected, sent the file to the Falcon 9, waiting on\nthe launchpad, all in less than thirty minutes. \u201cNASA wasn\u2019t used to this,\u201d\nWatson said. \u201cIf something went wrong with the shuttle, everyone was just\nresigned to waiting three weeks before they could try and launch again.\u201d12", "From time to time, Musk will send out an e-mail to the entire company\nto enforce a new policy or let them know about something that\u2019s bothering\nhim. One of the more famous e-mails arrived in May 2010 with the subject\nline: Acronyms Seriously Suck:\nThere is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX.\nExcessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to\ncommunication and keeping communication good as we grow is\nincredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there\nmay not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up,\nover time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to\nnew employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms\nand people don\u2019t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit\nthere in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.\nThat needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action\u2014I\nhave given enough warnings over the years. Unless an acronym is\napproved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is\nan existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be\neliminated, as I have requested in the past.\nFor example, there should be no \u201cHTS\u201d [horizontal test stand] or\n\u201cVTS\u201d [vertical test stand] designations for test stands. Those are\nparticularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary words. A \u201cstand\u201d at\nour test site is obviously a *test* stand. VTS-3 is four syllables\ncompared with \u201cTripod,\u201d which is two, so the bloody acronym\nversion actually takes longer to say than the name!\nThe key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts\ncommunication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX\nalready know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok to make up a\nfew acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have\napproved them, eg MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or\nMerlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need to be kept to a minimum.\nThis was classic Musk. The e-mail is rough in its tone and yet not really\nunwarranted for a guy who just wants things done as efficiently as possible.\nIt obsesses over something that other people might find trivial and yet he\nhas a definite point. It\u2019s comical in that Musk wants all acronym approvals\nto run directly through him, but that\u2019s entirely in keeping with the hands-on", "management style that has, mainly, worked well at both SpaceX and Tesla.\nEmployees have since dubbed the acronym policy the ASS Rule.\nThe guiding principle at SpaceX is to embrace your work and get stuff\ndone. People who await guidance or detailed instructions languish. The\nsame goes for workers who crave feedback. And the absolute worst thing\nthat someone can do is inform Musk that what he\u2019s asking is impossible. An\nemployee could be telling Musk that there\u2019s no way to get the cost on\nsomething like that actuator down to where he wants it or that there is\nsimply not enough time to build a part by Musk\u2019s deadline. \u201cElon will say,\n\u2018Fine. You\u2019re off the project, and I am now the CEO of the project. I will do\nyour job and be CEO of two companies at the same time. I will deliver it,\u2019\u201d\nBrogan said. \u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is that Elon actually does it. Every time he\u2019s\nfired someone and taken their job, he\u2019s delivered on whatever the project\nwas.\u201d\nIt is jarring for both parties when the SpaceX culture rubs against more\nbureaucratic bodies like NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and the Federal\nAviation Administration. The first inklings of these difficulties appeared on\nKwaj, where government officials sometimes questioned what they saw as\nSpaceX\u2019s cavalier approach to the launch process. There were times when\nSpaceX would want to make a change to its launch procedures and any such\nchange would require a pile of paperwork. SpaceX, for example, would\nhave written down all the steps needed to replace a filter\u2014put on gloves,\nwear safety goggles, remove a nut\u2014and then want to alter this procedure or\nuse a different type of filter. The FAA would need a week to review the new\nprocess before SpaceX could actually go about changing the filter on the\nrocket, a lag that both the engineers and Musk found ridiculous. On one\noccasion after this type of thing happened, Musk laid into an FAA official\nwhile on a conference call with members of the SpaceX team and NASA.\n\u201cIt got hot and heated, and he berated this guy on a personal level for like\nten minutes,\u201d Brogan said.\nMusk did not recall this incident but did remember other confrontations\nwith the FAA. One time he compiled a list of things an FAA subordinate\nhad said during a meeting that Musk found silly and sent the list along to\nthe guy\u2019s boss. \u201cAnd then his dingbat manager sent me this long e-mail\nabout how he had been in the shuttle program and in charge of twenty\nlaunches or something like that and how dare I say that the other guy was\nwrong,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI told him, \u2018Not only is he wrong, and let me", "rearticulate the reasons, but you\u2019re wrong, and let me articulate the\nreasons.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he sent me another e-mail after that. We\u2019re trying to\nhave a really big impact on the space industry. If the rules are such that you\ncan\u2019t make progress, then you have to fight the rules.\n\u201cThere is a fundamental problem with regulators. If a regulator agrees to\nchange a rule and something bad happens, they could easily lose their\ncareer. Whereas if they change a rule and something good happens, they\ndon\u2019t even get a reward. So, it\u2019s very asymmetric. It\u2019s then very easy to\nunderstand why regulators resist changing the rules. It\u2019s because there\u2019s a\nbig punishment on one side and no reward on the other. How would any\nrational person behave in such a scenario?\u201d\nIn the middle of 2009, SpaceX hired Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut,\nas its vice president of astronaut safety and mission assurance. Bowersox fit\nthe mold of recruit prized by a classic big aerospace company. He had a\ndegree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, had been a\ntest pilot in the air force, and flew on the space shuttle a handful of times.\nMany people within SpaceX saw his arrival at the company as a good thing.\nHe was considered a diligent, dignified sort who would provide a second set\nof eyes to many of SpaceX\u2019s procedures, checking to make sure the\ncompany went about things in a safe, standardized manner. Bowersox ended\nup smack in the middle of the constant pull and push at SpaceX between\ndoing things efficiently and agonizing over traditional procedures. He and\nMusk were increasingly at odds as the months passed, and Bowersox started\nto feel as if his opinions were being ignored. During one incident in\nparticular, a part made it all the way to the test stand with a major flaw\u2014\ndescribed by one engineer as the equivalent of a coffee cup not having a\nbottom\u2014instead of being caught at the factory. According to observers,\nBowersox argued that SpaceX should go back and investigate the process\nthat led to the mistake and fix its root cause. Musk had already decided that\nhe knew the basis of the problem and dismissed Bowersox after a couple of\nyears on the job. (Bowersox declined to speak on the record about his time\nat SpaceX.) A number of people inside SpaceX saw the Bowersox incident\nas an example of Musk\u2019s hard-charging manner undermining some much-\nneeded process. Musk had a totally different take on the situation, casting\nBowersox as not being up to the engineering demands at SpaceX.\nA handful of high-ranking government officials gave me their candid\ntakes on Musk, albeit without being willing to put their names to the", "remarks. One found Musk\u2019s treatment of air force generals and military men\nof similar rank appalling. Musk has been known to let even high-ranking\nofficials have it when he thinks they\u2019re off base and is not apologetic about\nthis. Another could not believe it when Musk would call very intelligent\npeople idiots. \u201cImagine the worst possible way that could come out, and it\nwould come out,\u201d this person said. \u201cLife with Elon is like being in a very\nintimate married couple. He can be so gentle and loyal and then really hard\non people when it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d One former official felt that Musk would\nneed to temper himself better in the years to come if SpaceX was to keep\ncurrying favor with the military and government agencies in its bid to defeat\nthe incumbent contractors. \u201cHis biggest enemy will be himself and the way\nhe treats people,\u201d this person said.\nWhen Musk rubs outsiders the wrong way, Shotwell is often there to try\nto smooth over the situation. Like Musk, she has a salty tongue and a fiery\npersonality, but Shotwell is willing to play the role of the conciliator. These\nskills have allowed her to handle the day-to-day operations at SpaceX,\nleaving Musk to focus on the company\u2019s overall strategy, the product\ndesigns, marketing, and motivating employees. Like all of Musk\u2019s most\ntrusted lieutenants, Shotwell has been willing to stay largely in the\nbackground, do her work, and focus on the company\u2019s cause.\nShotwell grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, the daughter of an artist\n(mom) and a neurosurgeon (dad). She played the part of a bright, pretty girl,\ngetting straight A\u2019s at school and joining the cheerleading squad. Shotwell\nhad not expressed a major inclination toward the sciences and knew only\none version of an engineer\u2014the guy who drives a train. But there were\nclues that she was wired a bit different. She was the daughter who mowed\nthe lawn and helped put the family basketball hoop together. In third grade,\nShotwell developed a brief interest in car engines, and her mom bought a\nbook detailing how they work. Later, in high school, Shotwell\u2019s mom\nforced her to attend a lecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology on a\nSaturday afternoon. As Shotwell listened to one of the panels, she grew\nenamored with a fifty-year-old mechanical engineer. \u201cShe had these\nbeautiful clothes, this suit and shoes that I loved,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cShe was\ntall and carried off the heels really well.\u201d Shotwell chatted with the engineer\nafter the talk, learning about her job. \u201cThat was the day I decided to become\na mechanical engineer,\u201d she said.", "Shotwell went on to receive an undergraduate degree in mechanical\nengineering and a master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics from\nNorthwestern University. Then she took a job at Chrysler. It was a type of\nmanagement training program meant for hotshot recent graduates who\nappeared to have leadership potential. Shotwell started out going to auto\nmechanics school\u2014\u201cI loved that\u201d\u2014and then from department to\ndepartment. While working on engines research, Shotwell found that there\nwere two very expensive Cray supercomputers sitting idle because none of\nthe veterans knew how to use them. A short while later, she logged onto the\ncomputers and set them up to run computational fluid dynamics, or CFD,\noperations to simulate the performance of valves and other components.\nThe work kept Shotwell interested, but the environment started to grate on\nher. There were rules for everything, including lots of union regulations\naround who could operate certain machines. \u201cI picked up a tool once, and\ngot written up,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I opened a bottle of liquid nitrogen and got\nwritten up. I started thinking that the job was not what I had anticipated it\nwould be.\u201d\nShotwell pulled out of the Chrysler training program, regrouped at\nhome, and then briefly pursued her doctorate in applied mathematics. While\nback on the Northwestern campus, one of her professors mentioned an\nopportunity at the Aerospace Corporation. Anything but a household name,\nAerospace Corporation has been headquartered in El Segundo since 1960,\nserving as a kind of neutral, nonprofit organization that advises the air\nforce, NASA, and other federal bodies on space programs. The company\nhas a bureaucratic feel but has proved very useful over the years with its\nresearch activities and ability to champion and nix costly endeavors.\nShotwell started at Aerospace in October 1988 and worked on a wide range\nof projects. One job required her to develop a thermal model that depicted\nhow temperature fluctuations in the space shuttle\u2019s cargo bay affected the\nperformance of equipment on various payloads. She spent ten years at\nAerospace and honed her skills as a systems engineer. By the end, though,\nShotwell had become irritated by the pace of the industry. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nunderstand why it had to take fifteen years to make a military satellite,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cYou could see my interest was waning.\u201d\nFor the next four years, Shotwell worked at Microcosm, a space start-up\njust down the road from the Aerospace Corporation, and became the head\nof its space systems division and business development. Boasting a", "combination of smarts, confidence, direct talk, and good looks, Shotwell\ndeveloped a reputation as a strong saleswoman. In 2002, one of her\ncoworkers, Hans Koenigsmann, left for SpaceX. Shotwell took\nKoenigsmann out for a going-away lunch and dropped him off at SpaceX\u2019s\nthen rinky-dink headquarters. \u201cHans told me to go in and meet Elon,\u201d\nShotwell said. \u201cI did, and that\u2019s when I told him, \u2018You need a good business\ndevelopment person.\u2019\u201d The next day Mary Beth Brown called Shotwell and\ntold her that Musk wanted to interview her for the new vice president of\nbusiness development position. Shotwell ended up as employee No. 7. \u201cI\ngave three weeks\u2019 notice at Microcosm and remodeled my bathroom\nbecause I knew I would not have a life after taking the job,\u201d she said.\nThrough the early years of SpaceX, Shotwell pulled off the miraculous\nfeat of selling something the company did not have. It took SpaceX so\nmuch longer than it had planned to have a successful flight. The failures\nalong the way were embarrassing and bad for business. Nonetheless,\nShotwell managed to sell about a dozen flights to a mix of government and\ncommercial customers before SpaceX put its first Falcon 1 into orbit. Her\ndeal-making skills extended to negotiating the big-ticket contracts with\nNASA that kept SpaceX alive during its leanest years, including a $278\nmillion contract in August 2006 to begin work on vehicles that could ferry\nsupplies to the ISS. Shotwell\u2019s track record of success turned her into\nMusk\u2019s ultimate confidante at SpaceX, and at the end of 2008, she became\npresident and chief operating officer at the company.\nPart of Shotwell\u2019s duties include reinforcing the SpaceX culture as the\ncompany grows larger and larger and starts to resemble the traditional\naerospace giants that it likes to mock. Shotwell can switch on an easygoing,\naffable air and address the entire company during a meeting or convince a\ncollection of possible recruits why they should sign up to be worked to the\nbone. During one such meeting with a group of interns, Shotwell pulled\nabout a hundred people into the corner of the cafeteria. She wore high-heel\nblack boots, skintight jeans, a tan jacket, and a scarf and had big hoop\nearnings dangling beside her shoulder-length blond hair. Pacing back and\nforth in front of the group with a microphone in hand, she asked them to\nannounce what school they came from and what project they were working\non while at SpaceX. One student went to Cornell and worked on Dragon,\nanother went to USC and did propulsion system design, and another went to\nthe University of Illinois and worked with the aerodynamics group. It took", "about thirty minutes to make it all the way around the room, and the\nstudents were, at least by academic pedigree and bright-eyed enthusiasm,\namong the most impressive youngsters in the world. The students peppered\nShotwell with questions\u2014her best moment, her advice for being successful,\nSpaceX\u2019s competitive threats\u2014and she replied with a mix of earnest\nanswers and rah-rah stuff. Shotwell made sure to emphasize the lean,\ninnovative edge SpaceX has over the more traditional aerospace companies.\n\u201cOur competitors are scared shitless of us,\u201d Shotwell told the group. \u201cThe\nbehemoths are going to have to figure out how to get it together and\ncompete. And it is our job to have them die.\u201d\nOne of SpaceX\u2019s biggest goals, Shotwell said, was to fly as often as\npossible. The company has never sought to make a fortune off each flight. It\nwould rather make a little on each launch and keep the flights flowing. A\nFalcon 9 flight costs $60 million, and the company would like to see that\nfigure drop to about $20 million through economies of scale and\nimprovements in launch technology. SpaceX spent $2.5 billion to get four\nDragon capsules to the ISS, nine flights with the Falcon 9, and five flights\nwith the Falcon 1. It\u2019s a price-per-launch total that the rest of the players in\nthe industry cannot comprehend let alone aspire to. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\nthose guys do with their money,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cThey are smoking it. I just\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d As Shotwell saw it, a number of new nations were showing\ninterest in launches, eyeing communications technology as essential to\ngrowing their economies and leveling their status with developed nations.\nCheaper flights would help SpaceX take the majority of the business from\nthat new customer set. The company also expected to participate in an\nexpanding market for human flights. SpaceX has never had any interest in\ndoing the five-minute tourist flights to low Earth orbit like Virgin Galactic\nand XCOR. It does, however, have the ability to carry researchers to\norbiting habitats being built by Bigelow Aerospace and to orbiting science\nlabs being constructed by various countries. SpaceX will also start making\nits own satellites, turning the company into a one-stop space shop. All of\nthese plans hinge on SpaceX being able to prove that it can fly on schedule\nevery month and churn through the $5 billion backlog of launches. \u201cMost of\nour customers signed up early and wanted to be supportive and got good\ndeals on their missions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in a phase now where we need to\nlaunch on time and make launching Dragons more efficient.\u201d", "For a short while, the conversation with the interns bogged down. It\nturned to some of the annoyances of SpaceX\u2019s campus. The company leases\nits facility and has not been able to build things like a massive parking\nstructure that would make life easier for its three-thousand-person\nworkforce. Shotwell promised that more parking, more bathrooms, and\nmore of the freebies that technology start-ups in Silicon Valley offer their\nemployees would be on the way. \u201cI want a day care,\u201d she said.\nBut it was while discussing SpaceX\u2019s grandest missions that Shotwell\nreally came into her own and seemed to inspire the interns. Some of them\nclearly dreamed of becoming astronauts, and Shotwell said that working at\nSpaceX was almost certainly their best chance to get to space now that\nNASA\u2019s astronaut corps had dwindled. Musk had made designing cool-\nlooking, \u201cnon\u2013Stay Puft\u201d spacesuits a personal priority. \u201cThey can\u2019t be\nclunky and nasty,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cYou have to do better than that.\u201d As for\nwhere the astronauts would go: well, there were the space habitats, the\nmoon, and, of course, Mars as options. SpaceX has already started testing a\ngiant rocket, called the Falcon Heavy, that will take it much farther into\nspace than the Falcon 9, and it has another, even larger spaceship on the\nway. \u201cOur Falcon Heavy rocket will not take a busload of people to Mars,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s something after Heavy. We\u2019re working on it.\u201d To\nmake something like that vehicle happen, she said, the SpaceX employees\nneeded to be effective and pushy. \u201cMake sure your output is high,\u201d Shotwell\nsaid. \u201cIf we\u2019re throwing a bunch of shit in your way, you need to be mouthy\nabout it. That\u2019s not a quality that\u2019s widely accepted elsewhere, but it is at\nSpaceX.\u201d And, if that sounded harsh, so be it. As Shotwell saw it, the\ncommercial space race was coming down to SpaceX and China and that\u2019s it.\nAnd in the bigger picture, the race was on to ensure man\u2019s survival. \u201cIf you\nhate people and think human extinction is okay, then fuck it,\u201d Shotwell said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to space. If you think it is worth humans doing some risk\nmanagement and finding a second place to go live, then you should be\nfocused on this issue and willing to spend some money. I am pretty sure we\nwill be selected by NASA to drop landers and rovers off on Mars. Then the\nfirst SpaceX mission will be to drop off a bunch of supplies, so that once\npeople get there, there will be places to live and food to eat and stuff for\nthem to do.\u201d\nIt\u2019s talk like this that thrills and amazes people in the aerospace industry,\nwho have long been hoping that some company would come along and truly", "revolutionize space travel. Aeronautics experts will point out that twenty\nyears after the Wright brothers started their experiments, air travel had\nbecome routine. The launch business, by contrast, appears to have frozen.\nWe\u2019ve been to the moon, sent research vehicles to Mars, and explored the\nsolar system, but all of these things are still immensely expensive one-off\nprojects. \u201cThe cost remains extraordinarily high because of the rocket\nequation,\u201d said Carol Stoker, the planetary scientist at NASA. Thanks to\nmilitary and government contracts from agencies like NASA, the aerospace\nindustry has historically had massive budgets to work with and tried to\nmake the biggest, most reliable machines it could. The business has been\ntuned to strive for maximum performance, so that the aerospace contractors\ncan say they met their requirements. That strategy makes sense if you\u2019re\ntrying to send up a $1 billion military satellite for the U.S. government and\nsimply cannot afford for the payload to blow up. But on the whole, this\napproach stifles the pursuit of other endeavors. It leads to bloat and excess\nand a crippling of the commercial space industry.\nOutside of SpaceX, the American launch providers are no longer\ncompetitive against their peers in other countries. They have limited launch\nabilities and questionable ambition. SpaceX\u2019s main competitor for domestic\nmilitary satellites and other large payloads is United Launch Alliance\n(ULA), a joint venture formed in 2006 when Boeing and Lockheed Martin\ncombined forces. The thinking at the time about the union was that the\ngovernment did not have enough business for two companies and that\ncombining the research and manufacturing work of Boeing and Lockheed\nwould result in cheaper, safer launches. ULA has leaned on decades of work\naround the Delta (Boeing) and Atlas (Lockheed) launch vehicles and has\nflown many dozens of rockets successfully, making it a model of reliability.\nBut neither the joint venture nor Boeing nor Lockheed, both of which can\noffer commercial services on their own, come close to competing on price\nagainst SpaceX, the Russians, or the Chinese. \u201cFor the most part, the global\ncommercial market is dominated by Arianespace [Europe], Long March\n[China] or Russian vehicles,\u201d said Dave Bearden, the general manager of\ncivil and commercial programs at the Aerospace Corporation. \u201cThere are\njust different labor rates and differences in the way they are built.\u201d\nTo put things more bluntly, ULA has turned into an embarrassment for\nthe United States. In March 2014, ULA\u2019s then CEO, Michael Gass, faced\noff against Musk during a congressional hearing that dealt, in part, with", "SpaceX\u2019s request to take on more of the government\u2019s annual launch load.\nA series of slides were rolled out that showed how the government\npayments for launches have skyrocketed since Boeing and Lockheed went\nfrom a duopoly to a monopoly. According to Musk\u2019s math presented at the\nhearing, ULA charged $380 million per flight, while SpaceX would charge\n$90 million per flight. (The $90 million figure was higher than SpaceX\u2019s\nstandard $60 million because the government has certain additional\nrequirements for particularly sensitive launches.) By simply picking\nSpaceX as its launch provider, Musk pointed out, the government would\nsave enough money to pay for the satellite going on the rocket. Gass had no\nreal retort. He claimed Musk\u2019s figures for the ULA launch price were\ninaccurate but failed to provide a figure of his own. The hearing also came\nas tensions between the United States and Russia were running high due to\nRussia\u2019s aggressive actions in Ukraine. Musk rightly noted that the United\nStates could soon be placing sanctions on Russia that could carry over to\naerospace equipment. ULA, as it happens, relies on Russian-made engines\nto send up sensitive U.S. military equipment in its Atlas V rockets. \u201cOur\nFalcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles are truly American,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cWe design and manufacture our rockets in California and Texas.\u201d\nGass countered that ULA had bought a two-year supply of Russian engines\nand purchased the blueprints to the machines and had them translated from\nRussian to English, and he said this with a straight face. (A few months\nafter the hearing, ULA replaced Gass as CEO and signed a deal with Blue\nOrigin to develop American-made rockets.)\nSome of the most disheartening moments of the hearing arrived when\nSenator Richard Shelby of Alabama took the microphone for questioning.\nULA has manufacturing facilities in Alabama and close ties to the senator.\nShelby felt compelled to play the role of hometown booster by repeatedly\npointing out that ULA had enjoyed sixty-eight successful launches and then\nasking Musk what he made of that accomplishment. The aerospace industry\nstands as one of Shelby\u2019s biggest donors and he\u2019s ended up surprisingly pro-\nbureaucracy and anticompetition when it comes to getting things into space.\n\u201cTypically competition results in better quality and lower-priced contracts\n\u2014but the launch market is not typical,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cIt is limited demand\nframed by government-industrial policies.\u201d The March hearing in which\nShelby made these statements would turn out to be something of a sham.\nThe government had agreed to put fourteen of its sensitive launches up for", "bid instead of just awarding them directly to ULA. Musk had come to\nCongress to present his case for why SpaceX made sense as a viable\ncandidate for those and other launches. The day after the hearing, the air\nforce cut the number of launches up for bid from fourteen to between seven\nand one. One month later, SpaceX filed a lawsuit against the air force\nasking for a chance to earn its launch business. \u201cSpaceX is not seeking to be\nawarded contracts for these launches,\u201d the company said on its\nfreedomtolaunch.com website. \u201cWe are simply seeking the right to\ncompete.\u201d*\nSpaceX\u2019s main competitor for ISS resupply missions and commercial\nsatellites in the United States is Orbital Sciences Corporation. Founded in\nVirginia in 1982, the company started out not unlike SpaceX, as the new kid\nthat raised outside funding and focused on putting smaller satellites into\nlow-Earth orbit. Orbital is more experienced, although it has a limited roster\nof machine types. Orbital depends on suppliers, including Russian and\nUkrainian companies, for its engines and rocket bodies, making it more of\nan assembler of spacecraft than a true builder like SpaceX. And, also unlike\nSpaceX, Orbital\u2019s capsules cannot withstand the journey back from the ISS\nto Earth, so it\u2019s unable to return experiments and other goods. In October\n2014, one of Orbital\u2019s rockets blew up on the launchpad. With its ability to\nlaunch on hold while it investigated the incident, Orbital reached out to\nSpaceX for help. It wanted to see if Musk had any extra capacity to take\ncare of some of Orbital\u2019s customers. The company also signaled that it\nwould move away from using Russian engines as well.\nAs for getting humans to space, SpaceX and Boeing were the victors in\na four-year NASA competition to fly astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX will get\n$2.6 billion, and Boeing will get $4.2 billion to develop their capsules and\nferry people to the ISS by 2017. The companies would, in effect, be\nreplacing the space shuttle and restoring the United States\u2019 ability to\nconduct manned flights. \u201cI actually don\u2019t mind that Boeing gets twice as\nmuch money for meeting the same NASA requirements as SpaceX with\nworse technology,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHaving two companies involved is better\nfor the advancement of human spaceflight.\u201d\nSpaceX had once looked like it too would be a one-trick pony. The\ncompany\u2019s original plans were to have the smallish Falcon 1 function as its\nprimary workhorse. At $6 million to $12 million per flight, the Falcon 1\nwas by far the cheapest means of getting something into orbit, thrilling", "people in the space industry. When Google announced its Lunar X Prize in\n2007\u2014$30 million in awards to people who could land a robot on the moon\n\u2014many of the proposals that followed selected the Falcon 1 as their\npreferred launch vehicle because it seemed like the only reasonably priced\noption for getting something to the moon. Scientists around the world were\nequally excited, thinking that for the first time they had a means of placing\nexperiments into orbit in a cost-effective way. But for all the enthusiastic\ntalk about the Falcon 1, the demand never arrived. \u201cIt became very clear\nthat there was a huge need for the Falcon 1 but no money for it,\u201d said\nShotwell. \u201cThe market has to be able to sustain a certain amount of\nvehicles, and three Falcon 1s per year does not make a business.\u201d The last\nFalcon 1 launch took place in July 2009 from Kwajalein, when SpaceX\ncarried a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian government. People in the\naerospace industry have been grumbling ever since. \u201cWe gave Falcon 1 a\nhell of a shot,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cI was emotional about it and disappointed.\nI\u2019d anticipated a flood of orders but, after eight years, they just did not\ncome.\u201d\nSpaceX has since expanded its launch capabilities at a remarkable pace\nand looks like it might be on the verge of getting that $12 million per flight\noption back. In June 2010, the Falcon 9 flew for the first time and orbited\nEarth successfully. In December 2010, SpaceX proved that the Falcon 9\ncould carry the Dragon capsule into space and that the capsule could be\nrecovered safely after an ocean landing.* It became the first commercial\ncompany ever to pull off this feat. Then, in May 2012, SpaceX went\nthrough the most significant moment in the company\u2019s history since that\nfirst successful launch on Kwajalein.\nOn May 22, at 3:44 A.M., a Falcon 9 rocket took off from the Kennedy\nSpace Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket did its yeoman-like\nwork boosting Dragon into space. Then the capsule\u2019s solar panels fanned\nout and Dragon became dependent on its eighteen Draco thrusters, or small\nrocket engines, to guide its path to the International Space Station. The\nSpaceX engineers worked in shifts\u2014some of them sleeping on cots at the\nfactory\u2014as it took the capsule three days for Dragon to make its journey.\nThey spent most of the time observing Dragon\u2019s flight and checking to see\nthat its sensor systems were picking up the ISS. Originally, Dragon planned\nto dock with the ISS around 4 A.M. on the twenty-fifth, but as the capsule\napproached the space station, an unexpected glint kept throwing off the", "calculations of a laser used to measure the distance between Dragon and the\nISS. \u201cI remember it being two and a half hours of struggle,\u201d Shotwell said.\nHer outfit of Uggs, a fishnet sweater, and leggings started to feel like\npajamas as the night wore on, and the engineers battled this unplanned\ndifficulty. Fearing all the time that the mission would be aborted, SpaceX\ndecided to upload some new software to the Dragon that would cut the size\nof the visual frame used by the sensors to eliminate the effect of the sunlight\non the machine. Then, just before 7 A.M., Dragon got close enough to the\nISS for Don Pettit, an astronaut, to use a fifty-eight-foot robotic arm to\nreach out and grab the resupply capsule. \u201cHouston, Station, it looks like\nwe\u2019ve got us a dragon by the tail,\u201d Pettit said.13\n\u201cI\u2019d been digesting my guts,\u201d Shotwell said. \u201cAnd then I am drinking\nchampagne at six in the morning.\u201d About thirty people were in the control\nroom when the docking happened. Over the next couple of hours, workers\nstreamed into the SpaceX factory to soak up the elation of the moment.\nSpaceX had set another first, as the only private company to dock with the\nISS. A couple of months later SpaceX received $440 million from NASA to\nkeep developing Dragon so that it could transport people. \u201cElon is changing\nthe way aerospace business is done,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Stoker. \u201cHe\u2019s managed\nto keep the safety factor up while cutting costs. He\u2019s just taken the best\nthings from the tech industry like the open-floor office plans and having\neveryone talking and all this human interaction. It\u2019s a very different way to\nmost of the aerospace industry, which is designed to produce requirements\ndocuments and project reviews.\u201d\nIn May 2014, Musk invited the press to SpaceX\u2019s headquarters to\ndemonstrate what some of that NASA money had bought. He unveiled the\nDragon V2, or version two, spacecraft. Unlike most executives, who like to\nshow their products off at trade shows or daytime events, Musk prefers to\nhold true Hollywood-style galas in the evenings. People arrived in\nHawthorne by the hundreds and snacked on hors d\u2019oeuvres until the 7:30\nP.M. showing. Musk appeared wearing a purplish velvet jacket and popping\nopen the capsule\u2019s door with a bump of his fist like the Fonz. What he\nrevealed was spectacular. The cramped quarters of past capsules were gone.\nThere were seven thin, sturdy, contoured seats arranged with four seats\nclose to the main console and a row of three seats in the back. Musk walked\naround in the capsule to show how roomy it was and then plopped down in\nthe central captain\u2019s chair. He reached up and unlocked a four-paneled flat-", "screen console that gracefully slid down right in front of the first row of\nseats.* In the middle of the console was a joystick for flying the aircraft and\nsome physical buttons for essential functions that astronauts could press in\ncase of an emergency or a malfunctioning touch-screen. The inside of the\ncapsule had a bright, metallic finish. Someone had finally built a spaceship\nworthy of scientist and moviemaker dreams.\nThere was substance to go with the style. The Dragon 2 will be able to\ndock with the ISS and other space habitats automatically without needing\nthe intervention of a robotic arm. It will run on a SuperDraco engine\u2014a\nthruster made by SpaceX and the first engine ever built completely by a 3-D\nprinter to go into space. This means that a machine guided by a computer\nformed the engine out of single piece of metal\u2014in this case the high-\nstrength alloy Inconel\u2014so that its strength and performance should exceed\nanything built by humans by welding various parts together. And most\nmind-boggling of all, Musk revealed that the Dragon 2 will be able to land\nanywhere on Earth that SpaceX wants by using the SuperDraco engines and\nthrusters to come to a gentle stop on the ground. No more landings at sea.\nNo more throwing spaceships away. \u201cThat is how a twenty-first-century\nspaceship should land,\u201d Musk said. \u201cYou can just reload propellant and fly\nagain. So long as we continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft, we will\nnever have true access to space.\u201d\nThe Dragon 2 is just one of the machines that SpaceX continues to\ndevelop in parallel. One of the company\u2019s next milestones will be the first\nflight of the Falcon Heavy, which is designed to be the world\u2019s most\npowerful rocket.* SpaceX has found a way to combine three Falcon 9s into\na single craft with 27 of the Merlin engines and the ability to carry more\nthan 53 metric tons of stuff into orbit. Part of the genius of Musk and\nMueller\u2019s designs is that SpaceX can reuse the same engine in different\nconfigurations\u2014from the Falcon 1 up to the Falcon Heavy\u2014saving on cost\nand time. \u201cWe make our main combustion chambers, turbo pump, gas\ngenerators, injectors, and main valves,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cWe have complete\ncontrol. We have our own test site, while most of the other guys use\ngovernment test sites. The labor hours are cut in half and so is the work\naround the materials. Four years ago, we could make two rockets a year and\nnow we can make twenty a year.\u201d SpaceX boasts that the Falcon Heavy can\ntake up twice the payload of the nearest competitor\u2014the Delta IV Heavy\nfrom Boeing/ULA\u2014at one-third the cost. SpaceX is also busy building a", "spaceport from the ground up. The goal is to be able to launch many rockets\nan hour from this facility located in Brownsville, Texas, by automating the\nprocesses needed to stand a rocket up on the pad, fuel it, and send it off.\nJust as it did in the early days, SpaceX continues to experiment with\nthese new vehicles during actual launches in ways that other companies\nwould dare not do. SpaceX will often announce that it\u2019s trying out a new\nengine or its landing legs and place the emphasis on that one upgrade in the\nmarketing material leading up to a launch. It\u2019s common, though, for SpaceX\nto test out a dozen other objectives in secret during a mission. Musk\nessentially asks employees to do the impossible on top of the impossible.\nOne former SpaceX executive described the working atmosphere as a\nperpetual-motion machine that runs on a weird mix of dissatisfaction and\neternal hope. \u201cIt\u2019s like he has everyone working on this car that is meant to\nget from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas,\u201d this executive said.\n\u201cThey will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when\nthey set off for New York after that year, all of the vice presidents think\nprivately that the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas. What ends up\nhappening is that the car gets to New Mexico\u2014twice as far as they ever\nexpected\u2014and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out\nof people.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a degree to which it\u2019s just never enough for Musk, no matter\nwhat it is. Case in point: the December 2010 launch in which SpaceX got\nthe Dragon capsule to orbit Earth and return successfully. This had been one\nof the company\u2019s great achievements, and people had worked tirelessly for\nmonths, if not years. The launch had taken place on December 8, and\nSpaceX had a Christmas party on December 16. About ninety minutes\nbefore the party started, Musk had called his top executives to SpaceX for a\nmeeting. Six of them, including Mueller, were decked out in party attire and\nready to celebrate the holidays and SpaceX\u2019s historic achievement around\nDragon. Musk laid into them for about an hour because the truss structure\nfor a future rocket was running behind schedule. \u201cTheir wives were sitting\nthree cubes over waiting for the berating to end,\u201d Brogan said. Other\nexamples of similar behavior have cropped up from time to time. Musk, for\nexample, rewarded a group of thirty employees who had pulled off a tough\nproject for NASA with bonuses that consisted of additional stock option\ngrants. Many of the employees, seeking instant, more tangible gratification,\ndemanded cash. \u201cHe chided us for not valuing the stock,\u201d Drew Eldeen, a", "former engineer, said. \u201cHe said, \u2018In the long run, this is worth a lot more\nthan a thousand dollars in cash.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t screaming or anything like that,\nbut he seemed disappointed in us. It was hard to hear that.\u201d\nThe lingering question for many SpaceX employees is when exactly\nthey will see a big reward for all their work. SpaceX\u2019s staff is paid well but\nby no means exorbitantly. Many of them expect to make their money when\nSpaceX files for an initial public offering. The thing is that Musk does not\nwant to go public anytime soon, and understandably so. It\u2019s a bit hard to\nexplain the whole Mars thing to investors, when it\u2019s unclear what the\nbusiness model around starting a colony on another planet will be. When\nthe employees heard Musk say that an IPO was years away and would not\noccur until the Mars mission looked more secure, they started to grumble,\nand when Musk found out, he addressed all of SpaceX in an e-mail that is a\nfantastic window into his thinking and how it differs from almost every\nother CEO\u2019s. (The full e-mail appears in Appendix 3.)\nJune 7, 2013\nGoing Public\nPer my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about\nSpaceX going public before the Mars transport system is in place.\nCreating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and\nalways has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public\ncompany diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until\nMars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering,\nbut, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to\nfoist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature\nof our mission.\nSome at SpaceX who have not been through a public company\nexperience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so.\nPublic company stocks, particularly if big step changes in\ntechnology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for\nreasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do\nwith anything except the economy. This causes people to be\ndistracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of\ncreating great products.", "For those who are under the impression that they are so clever\nthat they can outsmart public market investors and would sell\nSpaceX stock at the \u201cright time,\u201d let me relieve you of any such\nnotion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then\nthere is no need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as\nyou can just invest in other public company stocks and make\nbillions of dollars in the market.\nElon", "10", "THE REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR\nT\nHERE ARE SO MANY TELEVISION COMMERCIALS FOR CARS\nAND TRUCKS that it\u2019s easy to become immune to them and ignore what\u2019s\ntaking place in the ads. That\u2019s okay. Because there\u2019s not really much of note\nhappening. Carmakers looking to put a modicum of effort into their ads\nhave been hawking the exact same things for decades: a car with a bit more\nroom, a few extra miles per gallon, better handling, or an extra cup holder.\nThose that can\u2019t find anything interesting at all to tout about their cars turn\nto scantily clad women, men with British accents, and, when necessary,\ndancing mice in tuxedos to try and convince people that their products are\nbetter than the rest. Next time a car ad appears on your television, pause for\na moment and really listen to what\u2019s being said. When you realize that the\nVolkswagen sign-and-drive \u201cevent\u201d is code for \u201cwe\u2019re making the\nexperience of buying a car slightly less miserable than usual,\u201d you\u2019ll start to\nappreciate just how low the automotive industry has sunk.\nIn the middle of 2012, Tesla Motors stunned its complacent peers in the\nautomotive industry. It began shipping the Model S sedan. This all-electric\nluxury vehicle could go more than 300 miles on a single charge. It could\nreach 60 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds. It could seat seven people, if you\nused a couple of optional rear-facing seats in the back for kids. It also had\ntwo trunks. There was the standard one and then what Tesla calls a \u201cfrunk\u201d\nup front, where the bulky engine would usually be. The Model S ran on an\nelectric battery pack that makes up the base of the car and a watermelon-\nsized electric motor located between the rear tires. Getting rid of the engine\nand its din of clanging machinery also meant that the Model S ran silently.\nThe Model S outclassed most other luxury sedans in terms of raw speed,\nmileage, handling, and storage space.\nAnd there was more\u2014like a cutesy thing with the door handles, which\nwere flush with the car\u2019s body until the driver got close to the Model S.\nThen the silver handles would pop out, the driver would open the door and\nget in, and the handles would retract flush with the car\u2019s body again. Once", "inside, the driver encountered a seventeen-inch touch-screen that controlled\nthe vast majority of the car\u2019s functions, be it raising the volume on the\nstereo* or opening the sunroof with a slide of the finger. Whereas most cars\nhave a large dashboard to accommodate various displays and buttons and to\nprotect people from the noise of the engine, the Model S offered up vast\namounts of space. The Model S had an ever-present Internet connection,\nallowing the driver to stream music through the touch console and to\ndisplay massive Google maps for navigation. The driver didn\u2019t need to turn\na key or even push an ignition button to start the car. His weight in the seat\ncoupled with a sensor in the key fob, which is shaped like a tiny Model S,\nwas enough to activate the vehicle. Made of lightweight aluminum, the car\nachieved the highest safety rating in history. And it could be recharged for\nfree at Tesla\u2019s stations lining highways across the United States and later\naround the world.\nFor both engineers and green-minded people, the Model S presented a\nmodel of efficiency. Traditional cars and hybrids have anywhere from\nhundreds to thousands of moving parts. The engine must perform constant,\ncontrolled explosions with pistons, crankshafts, oil filters, alternators, fans,\ndistributors, valves, coils, and cylinders among the many pieces of\nmachinery needed for the work. The oomph produced by the engine must\nthen be passed through clutches, gears, and driveshafts to make the wheels\nturn, and then exhaust systems have to deal with the waste. Cars end up\nbeing about 10\u201320 percent efficient at turning the input of gasoline into the\noutput of propulsion. Most of the energy (about 70 percent) is lost as heat in\nthe engine, while the rest is lost through wind resistance, braking, and other\nmechanical functions. The Model S, by contrast, has about a dozen moving\nparts, with the battery pack sending energy instantly to a watermelon-sized\nmotor that turns the wheels. The Model S ends up being about 60 percent\nefficient, losing most of the rest of its energy to heat. The sedan gets the\nequivalent of about 100 miles per gallon.*\nYet another distinguishing characteristic of the Model S was the\nexperience of buying and owning the car. You didn\u2019t go to a dealership and\nhaggle with a pushy salesman. Tesla sold the Model S directly through its\nown stores and website. Typically, the stores were placed in high-end malls\nor affluent suburbs, not far from the Apple stores on which they were\nmodeled. Customers would walk in and find a complete Model S in the\nmiddle of the shop and often an exposed version of the car\u2019s base near the", "back of the store to show off the battery pack and motor. There were\nmassive touch-screens where people could calculate how much they might\nsave on fuel costs by moving to an all-electric car, and where they could\nconfigure the look and add-ons for their future Model S. Once the\nconfiguration process was done, the customer could give the screen a big,\nforceful swipe and his Model S would theatrically appear on an even bigger\nscreen in the center of the store. If you wanted to sit in the display model, a\nsalesman would pull back a red velvet rope near the driver\u2019s-side door and\nlet you enter the car. The salespeople were not compensated on commission\nand didn\u2019t have to try to talk you into buying a suite of extras. Whether you\nultimately bought the car in the store or online, it was delivered in a\nconcierge fashion. Tesla would bring it to your home, office, or anywhere\nelse you wanted it. The company also offered customers the option of\npicking their cars up from the factory in Silicon Valley and treating their\nfriends and family to a complimentary tour of the facility. In the months that\nfollowed the delivery, there were no oil changes or tune-ups to be dealt with\nbecause the Model S didn\u2019t need them. It had done away with so much of\nthe mechanical dreck standard in an internal combustion vehicle. However,\nif something did go wrong with the car, Tesla would come pick it up and\ngive the customer a loaner while it repaired the Model S.\nThe Model S also offered a way to fix issues in a manner that people\nhad never before encountered with a mass-produced car. Some of the early\nowners complained about glitches like the door handles not popping out\nquite right or their windshield wipers operating at funky speeds. These were\ninexcusable flaws for such a costly vehicle, but Tesla typically moved with\nclever efficiency to address them. While the owner slept, Tesla\u2019s engineers\ntapped into the car via the Internet connection and downloaded software\nupdates. When the customer took the car out for a spin in the morning and\nfound it working right, he was left feeling as if magical elves had done the\nwork. Tesla soon began showing off its software skills for jobs other than\nmaking up for mistakes. It put out a smartphone app that let people turn on\ntheir air-conditioning or heating from afar and to see where the car was\nparked on a map. Tesla also began installing software updates that imbued\nthe Model S with new features. Overnight, the Model S sometimes got new\ntraction controls for hilly and highway driving or could suddenly recharge\nmuch faster than before or possess a new range of voice controls. Tesla had\ntransformed the car into a gadget\u2014a device that actually got better after you", "bought it. As Craig Venter, one of the earliest Model S owners and the\nfamed scientist who first decoded man\u2019s DNA, put it, \u201cIt changes\neverything about transportation. It\u2019s a computer on wheels.\u201d\nThe first people to notice what Tesla had accomplished were the\ntechnophiles in Silicon Valley. The region is filled with early adopters\nwilling to buy the latest gizmos and suffer through their bugs. Normally this\nhabit applies to computing devices ranging from $100 to $2,000 in price.\nThis time around, the early adopters proved willing not only to spend\n$100,000 on a product that might not work but also to trust their well-being\nto a start-up. Tesla needed this early boost of confidence and got it on a\nscale few expected. In the first couple of months after the Model S went on\nsale, you might see one or two per day on the streets of San Francisco and\nthe surrounding cities. Then you started to see five to ten per day. Soon\nenough, the Model S seemed to feel like the most common car in Palo Alto\nand Mountain View, the two cities at the heart of Silicon Valley. The Model\nS emerged as the ultimate status symbol for wealthy technophiles, allowing\nthem to show off, get a new gadget, and claim to be helping the\nenvironment at the same time. From Silicon Valley, the Model S\nphenomenon spread to Los Angeles, then all along the West Coast and then\nto Washington, D.C., and New York (although to a lesser degree).\nAt first the more traditional automakers viewed the Model S as a\ngimmick and its surging sales as part of a fad. These sentiments, however,\nsoon gave way to something more akin to panic. In November 2012, just a\nfew months after it started shipping, the Model S was named Motor Trend\u2019s\nCar of the Year in the first unanimous vote that anyone at the magazine\ncould remember. The Model S beat out eleven other vehicles from\ncompanies such as Porsche, BMW, Lexus, and Subaru and was heralded as\n\u201cproof positive that America can still make great things.\u201d Motor Trend\ncelebrated the Model S as the first non\u2013internal combustion engine car ever\nto win its top award and wrote that the vehicle handled like a sports car,\ndrove as smoothly as a Rolls-Royce, held as much as a Chevy Equinox, and\nwas more efficient than a Toyota Prius. Several months later, Consumer\nReports gave the Model S its highest car rating in history\u201499 out of 100\u2014\nwhile proclaiming that it was likely the best car ever built. It was at about\nthis time that sales of the Model S started to soar alongside Tesla\u2019s share\nprice and that General Motors, among other automakers, pulled together a\nteam to study the Model S, Tesla, and the methods of Elon Musk.", "It\u2019s worth pausing for a moment to meditate on what Tesla had\naccomplished. Musk had set out to make an electric car that did not suffer\nfrom any compromises. He did that. Then, using a form of entrepreneurial\njudo, he upended the decades of criticisms against electric cars. The Model\nS was not just the best electric car; it was best car, period, and the car\npeople desired. America had not seen a successful car company since\nChrysler emerged in 1925. Silicon Valley had done little of note in the\nautomotive industry. Musk had never run a car factory before and was\nconsidered arrogant and amateurish by Detroit. Yet, one year after the\nModel S went on sale, Tesla had posted a profit, hit $562 million in\nquarterly revenue, raised its sales forecast, and become as valuable as\nMazda Motor. Elon Musk had built the automotive equivalent of the\niPhone. And car executives in Detroit, Japan, and Germany had only their\ncrappy ads to watch as they pondered how such a thing had occurred.\nYou can forgive the automotive industry veterans for being caught\nunawares. For years Tesla had looked like an utter disaster incapable of\ndoing much of anything right. It took until early 2009 for Tesla to really hit\nits stride with the Roadster and work out the manufacturing issues behind\nthe sports car. Just as the company tried to build some momentum around\nthe Roadster, Musk sent out an e-mail to customers declaring a price hike.\nWhere the car originally started around $92,000, it would now start at\n$109,000. In the e-mail, Musk said that four hundred customers who had\nalready placed their orders for a Roadster but not yet received them would\nbear the brunt of the price change and need to cough up the extra cash. He\ntried to assuage Tesla\u2019s customer base by arguing that the company had no\nchoice but to raise prices. The manufacturing costs for the Roadster had\ncome in much higher than the company initially expected, and Tesla needed\nto prove that it could make the cars at a profit to bolster its chances of\nsecuring a large government loan that would be needed to build the Model\nS, which it vowed to deliver in 2011. \u201cI firmly believe that the plan . . .\nstrikes a reasonable compromise between being fair to early customers and\nensuring the viability of Tesla, which is obviously in the best interests of all\ncustomers,\u201d Musk wrote in the e-mail. \u201cMass market electric cars have been\nmy goal from the beginning of Tesla. I don\u2019t want and I don\u2019t think the vast\nmajority of Tesla customers want us to do anything to jeopardize that\nobjective.\u201d While some Tesla customers grumbled, Musk had largely read", "his customer base right. They would support just about anything he\nsuggested.\nFollowing the price increase, Tesla had a safety recall. It said that Lotus,\nthe manufacturer of the Roadster\u2019s chassis, had failed to tighten a bolt\nproperly on its assembly line. On the plus side, Tesla had only delivered\nabout 345 Roadsters, which meant that it could fix the problem in a\nmanageable fashion. On the downside, a safety recall was the last thing a\ncar start-up needs, even if it was, as Tesla claimed, more of a proactive\nmeasure than anything else. The next year, Tesla had another voluntary\nrecall. It had received a report of a power cable grinding against the body of\nthe Roadster to the point that it caused a short circuit and some smoke. That\ntime, Tesla brought 439 Roadsters in for a fix. Tesla did its best to put a\npositive spin on these issues, saying that it would make \u201chouse calls\u201d to fix\nthe Roadsters or pick up the cars and take them back to the factory. Ever\nsince, Musk has tried to turn any snafu with a Tesla into an excuse to show\noff the company\u2019s attention to service and dedication to pleasing the\ncustomer. More often than not, the strategy has worked.\nOn top of the occasional issues with the Roadster, Tesla continued to\nsuffer from public perception problems. In June 2009, Martin Eberhard\nsued Musk and went to town in the complaint detailing his ouster from the\ncompany. Eberhard accused Musk of libel, slander, and breach of contract.\nThe charges painted Musk as a bully moneyman who had pushed the\nsoulful inventor out of his own company. The lawsuit also accused Musk of\ntrumping up his role in Tesla\u2019s founding. Musk responded in kind, issuing a\nblog post that detailed his take on Eberhard\u2019s foibles and taking umbrage at\nthe suggestions that he was not a true founder of the company. A short\nwhile later, the two men settled and agreed to stop going at each other. \u201cAs\nco-founder of the company, Elon\u2019s contributions to Tesla have been\nextraordinary,\u201d Eberhard said in a statement at the time. It must have been\nexcruciating for Eberhard to agree to put that in writing and the very\nexistence of that statement points to Musk\u2019s skills and tactics as a hard-line\nnegotiator. The two men continue to despise each other today, although they\nmust do so in private, as legally required. Eberhard, though, holds no long-\nstanding grudge against Tesla. His shares in the company ended up\nbecoming very valuable. He still drives his Roadster, and his wife got a\nModel S.", "For so much of its early existence, Tesla appeared in the news for the\nwrong reasons. There were people in the media and the automotive industry\nwho viewed it as a gimmick. They seemed to delight in the soap opera\u2013\nworthy spats between Musk and Eberhard and other disgruntled former\nemployees. Far from being seen universally as a successful entrepreneur,\nMusk was viewed in some Silicon Valley circles as an abrasive blowhard\nwho would get what he deserved when Tesla inevitably collapsed. The\nRoadster would make its way to the electric-car graveyard. Detroit would\nprove that it had a better handle on this whole car innovation thing than\nSilicon Valley. The natural order of the world would remain intact.\nA funny thing happened, however. Tesla did just enough to survive.\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Tesla sold about 2,500 Roadsters.* The car had\naccomplished what Musk had intended from the outset. It proved that\nelectric cars could be fun to drive and that they could be objects of desire.\nWith the Roadster, Tesla kept electric cars in the public\u2019s consciousness and\ndid so under impossible circumstances, namely the collapse of the\nAmerican automotive industry and the global financial markets. Whether\nMusk was a founder of Tesla in the purest sense of the word is irrelevant at\nthis point. There would be no Tesla to talk about today were it not for\nMusk\u2019s money, marketing savvy, chicanery, engineering smarts, and\nindomitable spirit. Tesla was, in effect, willed into existence by Musk and\nreflects his personality as much as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple reflect the\npersonalities of their founders. Marc Tarpenning, the other Tesla cofounder,\nsaid as much when he reflected on what Musk has meant to the company.\n\u201cElon pushed Tesla so much farther than we ever imagined,\u201d he said.\nAs difficult as birthing the Roadster had been, the adventure had\nwhetted Musk\u2019s appetite for what he could accomplish in the automotive\nindustry with a clean slate. Tesla\u2019s next car\u2014code-named WhiteStar\u2014\nwould not be an adapted version of another company\u2019s vehicle. It would be\nmade from scratch and structured to take full advantage of what the electric-\ncar technology offered. The battery pack in the Roadster, for example, had\nto be placed near the rear of the car because of constraints imposed by the\nLotus Elise chassis. This was okay but not ideal due to the imposing weight\nof the batteries. With WhiteStar, which would become the Model S, Musk\nand Tesla\u2019s engineers knew from the start that they would place the 1,300-\npound battery pack on the base of the car. This would give the vehicle a low\ncenter of gravity and excellent handling. It would also give the Model S", "what\u2019s known as a low polar moment of inertia, which relates to how a car\nresists turning. Ideally, you want heavy parts like the engine as close as\npossible to the car\u2019s center of gravity, which is why the engines of race cars\ntend to be near the middle of the vehicle. Traditional cars are a mess on this\nmetric, with the bulky engine up front, passengers in the middle, and\ngasoline sloshing around the rear. In the case of the Model S, the bulk of the\ncar\u2019s mass is very close to the center of gravity and this has positive follow-\non effects to handling, performance, and safety.\nThe innards, though, were just one part of what would make the Model\nS shine. Musk wanted to make a statement with the car\u2019s look as well. It\nwould be a sedan, yes, but it would be a sexy sedan. It would also be\ncomfortable and luxurious and have none of the compromises that Tesla had\nbeen forced to embrace with the Roadster. To bring such a beautiful,\nfunctional car to life, Musk hired Henrik Fisker, a Danish automobile\ndesigner renowned for his work at Aston Martin.\nTesla first revealed its plans for the Model S to Fisker in 2007. It asked\nhim to design a sleek, four-door sedan that would cost between $50,000 and\n$70,000. Tesla could still barely make Roadsters and had no idea if its all-\nelectric powertrain would hold up over time. Musk, though, refused to wait\nand find out. He wanted the Model S to ship in late 2009 or early 2010 and\nneeded Fisker to work fast. By reputation, Fisker had a flair for the dramatic\nand had produced some of the most stunning car designs over the past\ndecade, not just for Aston Martin but also for special versions of BMW and\nMercedes-Benz vehicles.\nFisker had a studio in Orange County, California, and Musk and other\nTesla executives would meet there to go over his evolving takes on the\nModel S. Each visit was less inspiring than the last. Fisker baffled the Tesla\nteams with his stodgy designs. \u201cSome of the early styles were like a giant\negg,\u201d said Ron Lloyd, the former vice president of the WhiteStar project at\nTesla. \u201cThey were terrible.\u201d When Musk pushed back, Fisker blamed the\nphysical constraints Tesla had put in place for the Model S as too restrictive.\n\u201cHe said they would not let him make the car sexy,\u201d Lloyd said. Fisker tried\na couple of different approaches and unveiled some foam models of the car\nfor Musk and his crew to dissect. \u201cWe kept on telling him they were not\nright,\u201d Lloyd said.\nNot long after these meetings, Fisker started his own company\u2014Fisker\nAutomotive\u2014and unveiled the Fisker Karma hybrid in 2008. This luxury", "sedan looked like a vehicle Batman might take out for a Sunday drive. With\nits elongated lines and sharp edges, the car was stunning and truly original.\n\u201cIt rapidly became clear that he was trying to compete with us,\u201d Lloyd said.\nAs Musk dug into the situation, he discovered that Fisker had been\nshopping his idea for a car company to investors around Silicon Valley for\nsome time. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the more famous\nventure capital firms in Silicon Valley, once had a chance to invest in Tesla\nand then ended up putting money into Fisker instead. All of this was too\nmuch for Musk, and he launched a lawsuit against Fisker in 2008, accusing\nhim of stealing Tesla\u2019s ideas and using the $875,000 Tesla had paid for\ndesign work to help get his rival car company off the ground. (Fisker\nultimately prevailed in the dispute with an arbitrator ordering Tesla to\nreimburse Fisker\u2019s legal fees and deeming Tesla\u2019s allegations baseless.)\nTesla had thought about doing a hybrid like Fisker where a gas engine\nwould be present to recharge the car\u2019s batteries after they had consumed an\ninitial charge. The car would be able to travel fifty to eighty miles after\nbeing plugged into an outlet and then take advantage of ubiquitous gas\nstations as needed to top up the batteries, eliminating range anxiety. Tesla\u2019s\nengineers prototyped the hybrid vehicle and ran all sorts of cost and\nperformance metrics. In the end, they found the hybrid to be too much of a\ncompromise. \u201cIt would be expensive, and the performance would not be as\ngood as the all-electric car,\u201d said J. B. Straubel. \u201cAnd we would have\nneeded to build a team to compete with the core competency of every car\ncompany in the world. We would have been betting against all the things we\nbelieve in, like the power electronics and batteries improving. We decided\nto put all the effort into going where we think the endpoint is and to never\nlook back.\u201d After coming to this conclusion, Straubel and others inside\nTesla started to let go of their anger toward Fisker. They figured he would\nend up delivering a kluge of a car and get what was coming to him.\nA large car company might spend $1 billion and need thousands of\npeople to design a new vehicle and bring it to market. Tesla had nothing\nclose to these resources as it gave birth to the Model S. According to Lloyd,\nTesla initially aimed to make about ten thousand Model S sedans per year\nand had budgeted around $130 million to achieve this goal, including\nengineering the car and acquiring the manufacturing machines needed to\nstamp out the body parts. \u201cOne of the things Elon pushed hard with\neveryone was to do as much as possible in-house,\u201d Lloyd said. Tesla would", "make up for its lack of R&D money by hiring smart people who could\noutwork and outthink the third parties relied on by the rest of the\nautomakers. \u201cThe mantra was that one great engineer will replace three\nmedium ones,\u201d Lloyd said.\nA small team of Tesla engineers began the process of trying to figure\nout the mechanical inner workings of the Model S. Their first step in this\njourney took place at a Mercedes dealership where they test drove a CLS 4-\nDoor Coupe and an E-Class sedan. The cars had the same chassis, and the\nTesla engineers took measurements of every inch of the vehicles, studying\nwhat they liked and didn\u2019t like. In the end, they preferred the styling on the\nCLS and settled on it as their baseline for thinking about the Model S.\nAfter purchasing a CLS, Tesla\u2019s engineers tore it apart. One team had\nreshaped the boxy, rectangular battery pack from the Roadster and made it\nflat. The engineers cut the floor out of the CLS and plopped in the pack.\nNext they put the electronics that tied the whole system together in the\ntrunk. After that, they replaced the interior of the car to restore its fit and\nfinish. Following three months of work, Tesla had in effect built an all-\nelectric Mercedes CLS. Tesla used the car to woo investors and future\npartners like Daimler that would eventually turn to Tesla for electric\npowertrains in their vehicles. Now and again, the Tesla team took the car\nout for drives on public roads. It weighed more than the Roadster but was\nstill fast and had a range of about 120 miles per charge. To perform these\njoyrides-cum-tests in relative secrecy, the engineers had to weld the tips of\nthe exhaust pipes back onto the car to make it look like any other CLS.\nIt was at this time, the summer of 2008, when an artsy car lover named\nFranz von Holzhausen joined Tesla. His job would be to breathe new life\ninto the car\u2019s early designs and, if possible, turn the Model S into an iconic\nproduct.*\nVon Holzhausen grew up in a small Connecticut town. His father\nworked on the design and marketing of consumer products, and Franz\ntreated the family basement full of markers, different kinds of paper, and\nother materials as a playground for his imagination. As he grew older, von\nHolzhausen drifted toward cars. He and a friend stripped down a dune-\nbuggy motor one winter and then built it back up, and von Holzhausen\nalways filled the margins of his school notebooks with drawings of cars and\nhad pictures of cars on his bedroom walls. Applying to college, von\nHolzhausen decided to follow his father\u2019s path and enrolled in the industrial", "design program at Syracuse University. Then, through a chance encounter\nwith another designer during an internship, von Holzhausen heard about the\nArt Center College of Design in Los Angeles. \u201cThis guy had been teaching\nme about car design and this school in Los Angeles, and I got super-\nintrigued,\u201d said von Holzhausen. \u201cI went to Syracuse for two years and then\ndecided to transfer out to California.\u201d\nThe move to Los Angeles kicked off a long and storied design career in\nthe automotive industry. Von Holzhausen would go on to intern in Michigan\nwith Ford and in Europe with Volkswagen, where he began to pick up on a\nmix of design sensibilities. After graduating in 1992, he started work for\nVolkswagen on just about the most exciting project imaginable\u2014a top-\nsecret new version of the Beetle. \u201cIt really was a magical time,\u201d von\nHolzhausen said. \u201cOnly fifty people in the world knew we were doing this\nproject.\u201d Von Holzhausen had a chance to work on the exterior and interior\nof the vehicle, including the signature flower vase built into the dashboard.\nIn 1997, Volkswagen launched the \u201cNew Beetle,\u201d and von Holzhausen saw\nfirsthand how the look of the car captivated the public and changed the way\npeople felt about Volkswagen, which had suffered from woeful sales in the\nUnited States. \u201cIt started a rebirth of the VW brand and brought design back\ninto their mix,\u201d he said.\nVon Holzhausen spent eight years with VW, climbing the ranks of its\ndesign team and falling in love with the car culture of Southern California.\nLos Angeles has long adored its cars, with the climate lending itself to all\nmanner of vehicles from convertibles to surfboard-toting vans. Almost all\nof the major carmakers set up design studios in the city. The presence of the\nstudios allowed von Holzhausen to hop from VW to General Motors and\nMazda, where he served as the company\u2019s director of design.\nGM taught von Holzhausen just how nasty a big car company could\nbecome. None of the cars in GM\u2019s lineup really excited him, and it seemed\nnear impossible to make a large impact on the company\u2019s culture. He was\none member of a thousand-person design team that divvyed up the makes of\ncars haphazardly without any consideration as to which person really\nwanted to work on which car. \u201cThey took all the spirit out of me,\u201d said von\nHolzhausen. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t want to die there.\u201d Mazda, by contrast, needed\nand wanted help. It let von Holzhausen and his team in Los Angeles put\ntheir imprint on every car in the North American vehicle lineup and to\nproduce a set of concept cars that reshaped how the company approached", "design. As von Holzhausen put it, \u201cWe brought the zoom-zoom back into\nthe look and feel of the car.\u201d\nVon Holzhausen started a project to make Mazda\u2019s cars more green by\nrevaluating the types of materials used to fabricate the seats and the fuels\ngoing into the vehicles. He had, in fact, just made an ethanol-based concept\ncar when, in early 2008, a friend told him that Tesla needed a chief designer.\nAfter playing phone tag for a month with Musk\u2019s assistant, Mary Beth\nBrown, to inquire about the position, von Holzhausen finally got in touch\nand met Musk for an interview at the SpaceX headquarters.\nMusk instantly saw von Holzhausen, with his bouffant, trendy clothes\nand laid-back attitude, as a free-spirited, creative complement and wooed\nhim with vigor. They took a tour of the SpaceX factory in Hawthorne and\nTesla\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley. Both facilities were chaotic and\nreeked of start-up. Musk ramped up the charm and sold von Holzhausen on\nthe idea that he had a chance to shape the future of the automobile and that\nit made sense to leave his cushy job at a big, proven automaker for this\nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \u201cElon and I went for a drive in the Roadster,\nand everyone was checking it out,\u201d von Holzhausen said. \u201cI knew I could\nstay at Mazda for ten years and get very comfortable or take a huge leap of\nfaith. At Tesla, there was no history, no baggage. There was just a vision of\nproducts that could change the world. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be involved\nwith that?\u201d\nWhile von Holzhausen knew the risks of going to a startup, he could not\nhave realized just how close Tesla was to bankruptcy when he joined the\ncompany in August 2008. Musk had coaxed von Holzhausen away from a\nsecure job and into the jaws of death. But in many ways, this is what von\nHolzhausen sought at this point in his career. Tesla did not feel as much like\na car company as a bunch of guys tinkering on a big idea. \u201cTo me, it was\nexciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a garage experiment, and it made cars cool\nagain.\u201d The suits were gone, and so were the veteran automotive hands\ndulled by years working in the industry. In their stead, von Holzhausen\nfound energetic geeks who didn\u2019t realize that what they wanted to do was\nborderline impossible. Musk\u2019s presence added to the energy and gave von\nHolzhausen confidence that Tesla actually could outflank much, much\nlarger competitors. \u201cElon\u2019s mind was always way beyond the present\nmoment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see that he was a step or three ahead of\neveryone else and one hundred percent committed to what we were doing.\u201d", "Von Holzhausen had examined the drawings of the Model S left by\nFisker and a clay model of the car and had come away unimpressed. \u201cIt was\na blob,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was clear to me that the people that had been working\non this were novices.\u201d Musk realized the same thing and tried to articulate\nwhat he wanted. Even though the words were not precise, they were good\nenough to give von Holzhausen a feel for Musk\u2019s vision and the confidence\nthat he could deliver on it. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re going to start over. We\u2019re going\nto work together and make this awesome.\u2019\u201d\nTo save money, the Tesla design center came to life inside the SpaceX\nfactory. A handful of people on von Holzhausen\u2019s team took over one\ncorner and put up a tent to add some separation and secrecy to what they\nwere doing. In the tradition of many a Musk employee, von Holzhausen had\nto build his own office. He made a pilgrimage to IKEA to buy some desks\nand then went to an art store to get some paper and pens.\nAs von Holzhausen began sketching the outside of the Model S, the\nTesla engineers had started up a project to build another electric CLS. They\nripped this one down to its very core, removing all of the body structure and\nthen stretching the wheelbase by four inches to match up with some of the\nearly Model S specifications. Things began moving fast for everyone\ninvolved in the Model S project. In the span of about three months, von\nHolzhausen had designed 95 percent of what people see today with the\nModel S, and the engineers had started building a prototype exterior around\nthe skeleton.\nThroughout this process, von Holzhausen and Musk talked every day.\nTheir desks were close, and the men had a natural rapport. Musk said he\nwanted an aesthetic that borrowed from Aston Martin and Porsche and\nsome specific functions. He insisted, for example, that the car seat seven\npeople. \u201cIt was like \u2018Holy shit, how do we pull this off in a sedan?\u2019\u201d von\nHolzhausen said. \u201cBut I understood. He had five kids and wanted\nsomething that could be thought of as a family vehicle, and he knew other\npeople would have this issue.\u201d\nMusk wanted to make another statement with a huge touchscreen. This\nwas years before the iPad would be released. The touch-screens that people\nran into now and again at airports or shopping kiosks were for the most part\nterrible. But to Musk, the iPhone and all of its touch functions made it\nobvious that this type of technology would soon become commonplace. He\nwould make a giant iPhone and have it handle most of the car\u2019s functions.", "To find the right size for the screen, Musk and von Holzhausen would sit in\nthe skeleton car and hold up laptops of different sizes, placing them\nhorizontally and vertically to see what looked best. They settled on a\nseventeen-inch screen in a vertical position. Drivers would tap on this\nscreen for every task except for opening the glove box and turning on the\nemergency lights\u2014jobs required by law to be performed with physical\nbuttons.\nSince the battery pack at the base of the car would weigh so much,\nMusk, the designers, and the engineers were always looking for ways to\nreduce the Model S\u2019s weight in other spots. Musk opted to solve a big\nchunk of this problem by making the body of the Model S out of\nlightweight aluminum instead of steel. \u201cThe non-battery-pack portion of the\ncar has to be lighter than comparable gasoline cars, and making it all\naluminum became the obvious decision,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThe fundamental\nproblem was that if we didn\u2019t make it out of aluminum the car wasn\u2019t going\nto be any good.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s word choice there\u2014\u201cobvious decision\u201d\u2014goes a long way\ntoward explaining how he operates. Yes, the car needed to be light, and, yes,\naluminum would be an option for making that happen. But at the time, car\nmanufacturers in North America had almost no experience producing\naluminum body panels. Aluminum tends to tear when worked by large\npresses. It also develops lines that look like stretch marks on skin and make\nit difficult to lay down smooth coats of paint. \u201cIn Europe, you had some\nJaguars and one Audi that were made of aluminum, but it was less than five\npercent of the market,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIn North America, there was nothing.\nIt\u2019s only recently that the Ford F-150 has arrived as mostly aluminum.\nBefore that, we were the only one.\u201d Inside of Tesla, attempts were\nrepeatedly made to talk Musk out of the aluminum body, but he would not\nbudge, seeing it as the only rational choice. It would be up to the Tesla team\nto figure out how to make the aluminum manufacturing happen. \u201cWe knew\nit could be done,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt was a question of how hard it would be\nand how long it would take us to sort it out.\u201d\nJust about all of the major design choices with the Model S came with\nsimilar challenges. \u201cWhen we first talked about the touch-screen, the guys\ncame back and said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing like that in the automotive supply\nchain,\u2019\u201d Musk said. \u201cI said, \u2018I know. That\u2019s because it\u2019s never been put in a\nfucking car before.\u2019\u201d Musk figured that computer manufacturers had tons of", "experience making seventeen-inch laptop screens and expected them to\nknock out a screen for the Model S with relative ease. \u201cThe laptops are\npretty robust,\u201d Musk said. \u201cYou can drop them and leave them out in the\nsun, and they still have to work.\u201d After contacting the laptop suppliers,\nTesla\u2019s engineers came back and said that the temperature and vibration\nloads for the computers did not appear to be up to automotive standards.\nTesla\u2019s supplier in Asia also kept pointing the carmaker to its automotive\ndivision instead of its computing division. As Musk dug into the situation\nmore, he discovered that the laptop screens simply had not been tested\nbefore under the tougher automotive conditions, which included large\ntemperature fluctuations. When Tesla performed the tests, the electronics\nended up working just fine. Tesla also started working hand in hand with\nthe Asian manufacturers to perfect their then-immature capacitive-touch\ntechnology and to find ways to hide the wiring behind the screen that made\nthe touch technology possible. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that we ended up with the\nonly seventeen-inch touch-screen in the world,\u201d Musk said. \u201cNone of the\ncomputer makers or Apple had made it work yet.\u201d\nThe Tesla engineers were radical by automotive industry standards but\neven they had problems fully committing to Musk\u2019s vision. \u201cThey wanted\nto put in a bloody switch or a button for the lights,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWhy\nwould we need a switch? When it\u2019s dark, turn the lights on.\u201d Next, the\nengineers put up resistance to the door handles. Musk and von Holzhausen\nhad been studying a bunch of preliminary designs in which the handles had\nyet to be drawn in and started to fall in love with how clean the car looked.\nThey decided that the handles should only present themselves when a\npassenger needed to get in the car. Right away, the engineers realized this\nwould be a technological pain, and they completely ignored the idea in one\nprototype version of the car, much to the dismay of Musk and von\nHolzhausen. \u201cThis prototype had the handles pivot instead of popping out,\u201d\nvon Holzhausen said. \u201cI was upset about it, and Elon said, \u2018Why the fuck is\nthis different? We\u2019re not doing this.\u2019\u201d\nTo crank up the pace of the Model S design, there were engineers\nworking all day and then others who would show up at 9 P.M. and work\nthrough the night. Both groups huddled inside of the 3,000-square-foot tent\nplaced on the SpaceX factory floor. Their workspace looked like a reception\narea at an outdoor wedding. \u201cThe SpaceX guys were amazingly respectful\nand didn\u2019t peek or ask questions,\u201d said Ali Javidan, one of the main", "engineers. As von Holzhausen delivered his specifications, the engineers\nbuilt the prototype body of the car. Every Friday afternoon, they brought\nwhat they had made into a courtyard behind the factory where Musk would\nlook it over and provide feedback. To run tests on the body, the car would\nbe loaded up with ballast to represent five people and then do loops around\nthe factory until it overheated or broke down.\nThe more von Holzhausen learned about Tesla\u2019s financial struggles, the\nmore he wanted the public to see the Model S. \u201cThings were so precarious,\nand I didn\u2019t want to miss our opportunity to get this thing finished and show\nit to the world,\u201d he said. That moment came in March 2009, when, just six\nmonths after von Holzhausen had arrived, Tesla unveiled the Model S at a\npress event held at SpaceX.\nAmid rocket engines and hunks of aluminum, Tesla showcased a gray\nModel S sedan. From a distance, the display model looked glamorous and\nrefined. The media reports from the day described the car as the love child\nof an Aston Martin and a Maserati. In reality, the sedan barely held together.\nIt still had the base structure of a Mercedes CLS, although no one in the\npress knew that, and some of the body panels and the hood were stuck to\nthe frame with magnets. \u201cThey could just slide the hood right off,\u201d said\nBruce Leak, a Tesla owner invited to attend the event. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really\nattached. They would put it back on and try and align it to get the fit and\nfinish right, but then someone would push on it, and it would move again. It\nwas one of those Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain moments.\u201d A couple\nof the Tesla engineers practiced test-driving the car for a couple of days\nleading up to the event to make sure that they knew just how long the car\nwould go before it overheated. While not perfect, the display accomplished\nexactly what Musk had intended. It reminded people that Tesla had a\ncredible plan to make electric cars more mainstream and that its cars were\nfar more ambitious than what big-time automakers like GM and Nissan\nseemed to have in mind both from a design and a range perspective.\nThe messy reality behind the display was that the odds of Tesla\nadvancing the Model S from a prop to a sellable car were infinitesimal. The\ncompany had the technical know-how and the will for the job. It just didn\u2019t\nhave much money or a factory that could crank out cars by the thousands.\nBuilding an entire car would require blanking machines that take sheets of\naluminum and chop them up into the appropriate size for doors, hoods, and\nbody panels. Next up would be the massive stamping machines and metal", "dies used to take the aluminum and bend it into precise shapes. Then there\nwould be dozens of robots that would aid in assembling the cars, computer-\ncontrolled milling machines for precise metalwork, painting equipment, and\na bevy of other machines for running tests. It was an investment that would\nrun into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Musk would also need to hire\nthousands of workers.\nAs with SpaceX, Musk preferred to build as much of Tesla\u2019s vehicles\nin-house as possible, but the high costs were limiting just how much Tesla\ncould take on. \u201cThe original plan was that we would do final assembly,\u201d\nsaid Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, the vice president of business development at\nTesla. Partners would stamp out the body parts, do the welding and handle\nthe painting, and ship everything to Tesla, where workers would turn the\nparts into a whole car. Tesla proposed to build a factory to handle this type\nof work first in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and then later in San Jose,\nCalifornia, and then pulled back on these proposals, much to the dismay of\ncity officials in both locales. The public hemming and hawing around\npicking the factory site did little to inspire confidence in Tesla\u2019s ability to\nknock out a second car and generated the same type of negative headlines\nthat had surrounded the Roadster\u2019s protracted delivery.\nO\u2019Connell had joined Tesla in 2006 to help solve some of the factory\nand financing issues. He grew up near Boston in a middle-class Irish family\nand went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree from Dartmouth College. After\nthat, O\u2019Connell attended the University of Virginia to get a master\u2019s degree\nin foreign policy and then Northwestern, where he got an MBA from the\nKellogg School of Management. He had fancied himself a scholar of the\nSoviet Union and its foreign and economic policy and had studied these\nareas at UVa. \u201cBut then, in 1988 and 1989, they\u2019re starting to close down\nthe Soviet Union, and, at the very least, I had a brand problem,\u201d O\u2019Connell\nsaid. \u201cIt started looking to me like I was heading to a career in academia or\nintelligence.\u201d It was then that O\u2019Connell\u2019s career took a detour into the\nbusiness world, where he became a management consultant working for\nMcCann Erickson Worldwide, Young & Rubicam, and Accenture, advising\ncompanies like Coca-Cola and AT&T.\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s career path changed more drastically in 2001 when the\nplanes hit the twin towers in New York. In the wake of the terrorist attacks,\nO\u2019Connell, like many people, decided to serve the United States in any\ncapacity that he could. In his late thirties, he had missed the window to be a", "soldier and instead focused his attention on trying to get into national\nsecurity work. O\u2019Connell went from office to office in Washington, D.C.,\nlooking for a job and had little luck until Lincoln Bloomfield, the assistant\nsecretary of state for political-military affairs, heard him out. Bloomfield\nneeded someone who could help prioritize missions in the Middle East and\nmake sure the right people were working on the right things, and he figured\nthat O\u2019Connell\u2019s management consulting experience made him a nice fit for\nthe job. O\u2019Connell became Bloomfield\u2019s chief of staff and dealt with a wide\nrange of charged situations, from trade negotiations to setting up an\nembassy in Baghdad. After gaining security clearance, O\u2019Connell also had\naccess to a daily report that collected information from intelligence and\nmilitary personnel on the status of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\u201cEvery morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight\nreport that included information on who got killed and what killed them,\u201d\nO\u2019Connell said. \u201cI kept thinking, This is insane. Why are we in this place?\nIt was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so invested in that\npart of the world?\u201d The unsurprising answer that O\u2019Connell came up with\nwas oil.\nThe more O\u2019Connell dug into the United States\u2019 dependence on foreign\noil, the more frustrated and despondent he became. \u201cMy clients were\nbasically the combat commanders\u2014people in charge of Latin America and\nCentral Command,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I talked with them and studied and\nresearched, I realized that even in peacetime, so many of our assets were\nemployed to support the economic pipeline around oil.\u201d O\u2019Connell decided\nthat the rational thing to do for his country and for his newborn son was to\nalter this equation. He looked at the wind industry and the solar industry\nand the traditional automakers but came away unconvinced that what they\nwere doing could have a radical enough impact on the status quo. Then,\nwhile reading Businessweek, he stumbled on an article about a start-up\ncalled Tesla Motors and went to the company\u2019s website, which described\nTesla as a place \u201cwhere we are doing things, not talking about things.\u201d \u201cI\nsent an e-mail telling them I had come from the national security area and\nwas really passionate about reducing our dependence on oil and figured it\nwas just a dead-letter type of thing,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cI got an e-mail back\nthe next day.\u201d\nMusk hired O\u2019Connell and quickly dispatched him to Washington, D.C.,\nto start poking around on what types of tax credits and rebates Tesla might", "be able to drum up around its electric vehicles. At the same time, O\u2019Connell\ndrafted an application for a Department of Energy stimulus package.* \u201cAll I\nknew is that we were going to need a shitload of money to build this\ncompany,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cMy view was that we needed to explore\neverything.\u201d Tesla had been looking for between $100 million and $200\nmillion, grossly underestimating what it would take to build the Model S.\n\u201cWe were na\u00efve and learning our way in the business,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\nIt January 2009, Tesla took over Porsche\u2019s usual spot at the Detroit auto\nshow, getting the space cheap because so many other car companies had\nbailed out on the event. Fisker had a luxurious booth across the hallway\nwith wood flooring and pretty blond booth babes draped over its car. Tesla\nhad the Roadster, its electric powertrain, and no frills.\nThe technology that Tesla\u2019s engineers displayed proved good enough to\nattract the attention of the big boys. Not long after the show, Daimler voiced\nsome interest in seeing what an electric Mercedes A Class car might look\nand feel like. Daimler executives said they would visit Tesla in about a\nmonth to discuss this proposition in detail, and the Tesla engineers decided\nto blow them away by producing two prototype vehicles before the visit.\nWhen the Daimler executives saw what Tesla had done, they ordered four\nthousand of Tesla\u2019s battery packs for a fleet of test vehicles in Germany.\nThe Tesla team pulled off the same kind of feats for Toyota and won its\nbusiness, too.\nIn May 2009, things started to take off for Tesla. The Model S had been\nunveiled, and Daimler followed that by acquiring a 10 percent stake in Tesla\nfor $50 million. The companies also formed a strategic partnership to have\nTesla provide the battery packs for one thousand of Daimler\u2019s Smart cars.\n\u201cThat money was important and went a long way back then,\u201d said\nO\u2019Connell. \u201cIt was also a validation. Here is the company that invented the\ninternal combustion engine, and they are investing in us. It was a seminal\nmoment, and I am sure it gave the guys over at the DOE the feeling that we\nwere real. It\u2019s not just our scientists saying this stuff is good. It\u2019s Mercedes\nfreaking Benz.\u201d\nSure enough, in January 2010, the Department of Energy struck a $465\nmillion loan agreement with Tesla.* The money was far more than Tesla\nhad ever expected to get from the government. But it still represented just a\nfraction of the $1 billion plus that most carmakers needed to bring a new\nvehicle to market. So, while Musk and O\u2019Connell were thrilled to get the", "money, they still wondered if Tesla would be able to live up to the bargain.\nTesla would need one more windfall or, perhaps, to steal a car factory. And\nin May 2010, that\u2019s more or less what it did.\nGeneral Motors and Toyota had teamed up in 1984 to build New United\nMotor Manufacturing Inc., or NUMMI, on the site of a former GM\nassembly plant in Fremont, California, a city on the outskirts of Silicon\nValley. The companies hoped the joint facility would combine the best of\nAmerican and Japanese automaking skills and result in higher-quality,\ncheaper cars. The factory went on to pump out millions of vehicles like the\nChevy Nova and Toyota Corolla. Then the recession hit, and GM found\nitself trying to climb out of bankruptcy. It decided to abandon the plant in\n2009, and Toyota followed right after, saying it would close down the whole\nfacility, leaving five thousand people without jobs.\nAll of a sudden, Tesla had the chance to buy a 5.3-million-square-foot\nplant in its backyard. Just one month after the last Toyota Corolla went off\nthe manufacturing line in April 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a\npartnership and transfer of the factory. Tesla agreed to pay $42 million for a\nlarge portion of the factory (once worth $1 billion), while Toyota invested\n$50 million in Tesla for a 2.5 percent stake in the company. Tesla had\nbasically secured a factory, including the massive metal-stamping machines\nand other equipment, for free.*\nThe string of fortunate turns for Tesla left Musk feeling good. Just after\nthe factory deal closed in the summer of 2010, Tesla started the process of\nfiling for an initial public offering. The company obviously needed as much\ncapital as it could get to bring the Model S to market and push forward with\nits other technology projects. Tesla hoped to raise about $200 million.\nFor Musk, going public represented something of a Faustian bargain.\nEver since the Zip2 and PayPal days, Musk has done everything in his\npower to maintain absolute control over his companies. Even if he remained\nthe largest shareholder in Tesla, the company would be subjected to the\ncapricious nature of the public markets. Musk, the ultimate long-term\nthinker, would face constant second-guessing from investors looking for\nshort-term returns. Tesla would also be subject to public scrutiny, as it\nwould be forced to open its books for public consumption. This was bad\nbecause Musk prefers to operate in secrecy and because Tesla\u2019s financial\nsituation looked awful. The company had one product (the Roadster), had\nhuge development costs, and had bordered on bankruptcy months earlier.", "The car blog Jalopnik greeted the Tesla IPO as a Hail Mary rather than a\nsound fiscal move. \u201cFor lack of a better phrase, Tesla is a money pit,\u201d the\nblog wrote. \u201cSince the company\u2019s founding in 2003, it\u2019s managed to incur\nover $290 million in losses on just $147.6 million in revenue.\u201d Told by a\nsource that Tesla hoped to sell 20,000 units of the Model S per year at\n$58,000 a pop, Jalopnik scoffed. \u201cEven considering the supposed pent-up\ndemand among environmentalists for a car like the Model S, those are\nambitious goals for a small company planning to launch a niche luxury\nproduct into a soft market. Frankly, we\u2019re skeptical. We\u2019ve seen how brutal\nand unforgiving the market can be, and other automakers aren\u2019t simply\ngoing to roll over and surrender that volume to Tesla.\u201d Other pundits\nconcurred with this assessment.\nTesla went public on June 29, 2010, nonetheless. It raised $226 million,\nwith the company\u2019s shares shooting up 41 percent that day. Investors looked\npast Tesla\u2019s $55.7 million loss in 2009 and the more than $300 million the\ncompany had spent in seven years. The IPO stood as the first for an\nAmerican carmaker since Ford went public in 1956. Competitors continued\nto treat Tesla like an annoying, ankle-biting dachshund. Nissan\u2019s CEO,\nCarlos Ghosn, used the event to remind people that Tesla was but a\npipsqueak and that his company had plans to pump out up to 500,000\nelectric cars by 2012.\nFlush with funds, Musk began expanding some of the engineering teams\nand formalizing the development work around the Model S. Tesla\u2019s main\noffices moved from San Mateo to a larger building in Palo Alto, and von\nHolzhausen expanded the design team in Los Angeles. Javidan hopped\nbetween projects, helping develop technology for the electrified Mercedes-\nBenz, an electric Toyota Rav4, and prototypes of the Model S. The Tesla\nteam worked fast inside of a tiny lab with about 45 people knocking out 35\nRav4 test vehicles at the rate of about two cars per week. The alpha version\nof the Model S, including newly stamped body parts from the Fremont\nfactory, a revamped battery pack, and revamped power electronics, came to\nlife in the basement of the Palo Alto office. \u201cThe first prototype was\nfinished at about two A.M.,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cWe were so excited that we\ndrove it around without glass, any interior, or a hood.\u201d\nA day or two later, Musk came to check out the vehicle. He jumped into\nthe car and drove it to the opposite end of the basement, where he could\nspend some time alone with it. He got out and walked around the vehicle,", "and then the engineers came over to hear his take on the machine. This\nprocess would be repeated many times in the months to come. \u201cHe would\ngenerally be positive but constructive,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cWe would try and get\nhim rides whenever we could, and he might ask for the steering to be tighter\nor something like that before running off to another meeting.\u201d\nAbout a dozen of the alpha cars were produced. A couple went to\nsuppliers like Bosch to begin work on the braking systems, while others\nwere used for various tests and design tweaks. Tesla\u2019s executives kept the\nvehicles rotating on a strict schedule, giving one team two weeks for cold-\nweather testing and then shipping that alpha car to another team right away\nfor powertrain tuning. \u201cThe guys from Toyota and Daimler were blown\naway,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cThey might have two hundred alpha cars and several\nhundred to a thousand beta cars. We were doing everything from crash tests\nto the interior design with about fifteen cars. That was amazing to them.\u201d\nTesla employees developed similar techniques to their counterparts at\nSpaceX for dealing with Musk\u2019s high demands. The savvy engineers knew\nbetter than to go into a meeting and deliver bad news without some sort of\nalternative plan at the ready. \u201cOne of the scariest meetings was when we\nneeded to ask Elon for an extra two weeks and more money to build out\nanother version of the Model S,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cWe put together a plan,\nstating how long things would take and what they would cost. We told him\nthat if he wanted the car in thirty days it would require hiring some new\npeople, and we presented him with a stack of resumes. You don\u2019t tell Elon\nyou can\u2019t do something. That will get you kicked out of the room. You need\neverything lined up. After we presented the plan, he said, \u2018Okay, thanks.\u2019\nEveryone was like, \u2018Holy shit, he didn\u2019t fire you.\u2019\u201d\nThere were times when Musk would overwhelm the Tesla engineers\nwith his requests. He took a Model S prototype home for a weekend and\ncame back on the Monday asking for around eighty changes. Since Musk\nnever writes anything down, he held all the alterations in his head and\nwould run down the checklist week by week to see what the engineers had\nfixed. The same engineering rules as those at SpaceX applied. You did what\nMusk asked or were prepared to burrow down into the properties of\nmaterials to explain why something could not be done. \u201cHe always said,\n\u2018Take it down to the physics,\u2019\u201d Javidan said.\nAs the development of the Model S neared completion in 2012, Musk\nrefined his requests and dissection style. He went over the Model S with", "von Holzhausen every Friday at Tesla\u2019s design studio in Los Angeles. Von\nHolzhausen and his small team had moved out of the corner in the SpaceX\nfactory and gotten their own hangar-shaped facility near the rear of the\nSpaceX complex.* The building had a few offices and then one large, wide-\nopen area where various mock-ups of vehicles and parts awaited inspection.\nDuring a visit I made in 2012, there was one complete Model S, a skeletal\nversion of the Model X\u2014an as yet to be released SUV\u2014and a selection of\ntires and hubcaps lined up against the wall. Musk sank into the Model S\ndriver seat and von Holzhausen climbed into the passenger seat. Musk\u2019s\neyes darted around for a few moments and then settled onto the sun visor. It\nwas beige and a visible seam ran around the edge and pushed the fabric out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fish-lipped,\u201d Musk said. The screws attaching the visor to the car were\nvisible as well, and Musk insisted that every time he saw them it felt like\ntiny daggers were stabbing him in the eyes. The whole situation was\nunacceptable. \u201cWe have to decide what is the best sun visor in the world\nand then do better,\u201d Musk said. A couple of assistants taking notes outside\nof the car jotted this down.\nThis process played out again with the Model X. This was to be Tesla\u2019s\nmerger of an SUV and a minivan built off the Model S foundation. Von\nHolzhausen had four different versions of the vehicle\u2019s center console\nresting on the floor, so that they could be slotted in one by one and viewed\nby Musk. The pair spent most of their time, however, agonizing over the\nmiddle row of seats. Each one had an independent base so that each\npassenger could adjust his seat rather than moving the whole row\ncollectively. Musk loved the freedom this gave the passenger but grew\nconcerned after seeing all three seats in different positions. \u201cThe problem is\nthat they will never be aligned and might look a mess,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe\nhave to make sure they are not too hodgy podgy.\u201d\nThe idea of Musk as a design expert has long struck me as bizarre. He\u2019s\na physicist at heart and an engineer by demeanor. So much of who Musk is\nsays that he should fall into that Silicon Valley stereotype of the schlubby\nnerd who would only know good design if he read about it in a textbook.\nThe truth is that there might be some of that going on with Musk, and he\u2019s\nturned it into an advantage. He\u2019s very visual and can store things that others\nhave deemed to look good away in his brain for recall at any time. This\nprocess has helped Musk develop a good eye, which he\u2019s combined with his\nown sensibilities, while also refining his ability to put what he wants into", "words. The result is a confident, assertive perspective that does resonate\nwith the tastes of consumers. Like Steve Jobs before him, Musk is able to\nthink up things that consumers did not even know they wanted\u2014the door\nhandles, the giant touch-screen\u2014and to envision a shared point of view for\nall of Tesla\u2019s products and services. \u201cElon holds Tesla up as a product\ncompany,\u201d von Holzhausen said. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate that you have to get the\nproduct right. I have to deliver for him and make sure it\u2019s beautiful and\nattractive.\u201d\nWith the Model X, Musk again turned to his role as a dad to shape some\nof the flashiest design elements of the vehicle. He and von Holzhausen were\nwalking around the floor of an auto show in Los Angeles, and they both\ncomplained about the awkwardness of getting to the middle and back row\nseats in an SUV. Parents who have felt their backs wrench while trying to\nangle a child and car seat into a vehicle know this reality all too well, as\ndoes any decent-sized human who has tried to wedge into a third row seat.\n\u201cEven on a minivan, which is supposed to have more room, almost one-\nthird of the entry space is covered by the sliding door,\u201d von Holzhausen\nsaid. \u201cIf you could open up the car in a way that is unique and special, that\ncould be a real game changer. We took that kernel of an idea back and\nworked up forty or fifty design concepts to solve the problem, and I think\nwe ended up with one of the most radical ones.\u201d The Model X has what\nMusk coined as \u201cfalcon-wing doors.\u201d They\u2019re hinged versions of the gull-\nwing doors found on some high-end cars like the DeLorean. The doors go\nup and then flop over in a constrained enough way that the Model X won\u2019t\nrub up against a car parked close to it or hit the ceiling in a garage. The end\nresult is that a parent can plop a child in the second-row passenger seat\nwithout needing to bend over or twist at all.\nWhen Tesla\u2019s engineers first heard about the falcon-wing doors, they\ncringed. Here was Musk with another crazy ask. \u201cEveryone tried to come\nup with an excuse as to why we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put\nit in the garage. It won\u2019t work with things like skis. Then, Elon took a demo\nmodel to his house and showed us that the doors opened. Everyone is\nmumbling, \u2018Yeah, in a fifteen-million-dollar house, the doors will open just\nfine.\u2019\u201d Like the controversial door handles on the Model S, the Model X\u2019s\ndoors have become one of its most striking features and the thing\nconsumers talk about the most. \u201cI was one of the first people to test it out\nwith a kid\u2019s car seat,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cWe have a minivan, and you have to be", "a contortionist to get the seat into the middle row. Compared to that, the\nModel X was so easy. If it\u2019s a gimmick, it\u2019s a gimmick that works.\u201d\nDuring my 2012 visit to the design studio, Tesla had a number of\ncompetitors\u2019 vehicles in the parking lot nearby, and Musk made sure to\ndemonstrate the limitations of their seating compared to the Model X. He\ntried with honest effort to sit in the third row of an Acura SUV, but, even\nthough the car claimed to have room for seven, Musk\u2019s knees were pressed\nup to his chin, and he never really fit into the seat. \u201cThat\u2019s like a midget\ncave,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone can make a car big on the outside. The trick is to\nmake it big on the inside.\u201d Musk went from one rival\u2019s car to the next,\nilluminating the vehicles\u2019 flaws for me and von Holzhausen. \u201cIt\u2019s good to\nget a sense for just how bad the other cars are,\u201d he said.\nWhen these statements fly out of Musk\u2019s mouth, it\u2019s momentarily\nshocking. Here\u2019s a guy who needed nine years to produce about three\nthousand cars ridiculing automakers that build millions of vehicles every\nyear. In that context, his ribbing comes off as absurd.\nMusk, though, approaches everything from a Platonic perspective. As\nhe sees it, all of the design and technology choices should be directed\ntoward the goal of making a car as close to perfect as possible. To the extent\nthat rival automakers haven\u2019t, that\u2019s what Musk is judging. It\u2019s almost a\nbinary experience for him. Either you\u2019re trying to make something\nspectacular with no compromises or you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not, Musk\nconsiders you a failure. This position can look unreasonable or foolish to\noutsiders, but the philosophy works for Musk and constantly pushes him\nand those around him to their limits.\nOn June 22, 2012, Tesla invited all of its employees, some select\ncustomers, and the press to its factory in Fremont to watch as the first\nModel S sedans were taken home. Depending on which of the many\npromised delivery dates you pick, the Model S was anywhere from eighteen\nmonths to two-plus years late. Some of the delays were a result of Musk\u2019s\nrequests for exotic technologies that needed to be invented. Other delays\nwere simply a function of this still quite young automaker learning how to\nproduce an immaculate luxury vehicle and needing to go through the trial\nand error tied to becoming a more mature, more refined company.\nThe outsiders were blown away by their first glimpse of the Tesla\nfactory. Musk had T-E-S-L-A painted in enormous black letters on the side\nof the building so that people driving by on the freeway, or flying above for", "that matter, were made well aware of the company\u2019s presence. The inside of\nthe factory, once dressed in the dark, dingy tones of General Motors and\nToyota, had taken on the Musk aesthetic. The floors received a white epoxy,\nthe walls and beams were painted white, the thirty-foot tall stamping\nmachines were white, and then much of the other machinery, like the teams\nof the robots, had been painted red, making the place look like an industrial\nversion of Santa Claus\u2019s workshop. Just as he did at SpaceX, Musk placed\nthe desks of his engineers right on the factory floor, where they worked in\nan area cordoned off by rudimentary cubicle dividers. Musk had a desk in\nthis area as well.*\nThe Model S launch event took place in a section of the factory where\nthey finish off the cars. There\u2019s a part of the floor with various grooves and\nbumps that the cars pass over, as technicians listen for any rattles. There\u2019s\nalso a chamber where water can be sprayed at high pressure onto the car to\ncheck for leaks. For the very last inspection, the Model S cruises onto a\nraised platform made out of bamboo, which, when coupled with lots of\nLED lighting, is meant to provide an abundant amount of contrast so that\npeople can spot flaws on the body. For the few first months that the Model\nS came off the line, Musk went to this bamboo stage to inspect every\nvehicle. \u201cHe was down on all fours looking up under the wheel well,\u201d said\nSteve Jurvetson, the investor and Tesla board member.\nHundreds of people had gathered around this stage to watch as the first\ndozen or so cars were presented to their owners. Many of the employees\nwere factory workers who had once been part of the autoworkers\u2019 union,\nlost their jobs when the NUMMI plant closed, and were now back at work\nagain, making the car of the future. They waved American flags and wore\nred, white, and blue visors. A handful of the workers cried as the Model S\nsedans were lined up on the stage. Even Musk\u2019s most cynical critics would\nhave softened for a moment while watching the proceedings. Say what you\nwill about Tesla receiving government money or hyping up the promise of\nthe electric car, it was trying to do something big and different, and people\nwere getting hired by the thousands as a result. With machines humming in\nthe background, Musk gave a brief speech and then handed the owners their\nkeys. They drove off the bamboo platform and out the factory doors, while\nthe Tesla employees provided a standing ovation.\nJust four weeks earlier, SpaceX had flown cargo to the International\nSpace Station and had its capsule returned to Earth\u2014firsts all around for a", "private company. That feat coupled with the launch of the Model S led to a\nrapid transformation in the way the world outside of Silicon Valley\nperceived Musk. The guy who was always promising, promising, promising\nwas doing\u2014and doing spectacular things. \u201cI may have been optimistic with\nrespect to the timing on some of these things, but I didn\u2019t over-promise on\nthe outcome,\u201d Musk told me during an interview after the Model S launch.\n\u201cI have done everything I said I was going to do.\u201d\nMusk did not have Riley around to celebrate with and share in this run\nof good fortune. They had divorced, and Musk had begun to think about\ndating again, if he could find the time. Even with this turmoil in his\npersonal life, however, Musk had reached a point of calm that he had not\nfelt in many years. \u201cMy main emotion is that there is a bit of weight off my\nshoulders,\u201d he said at the time. Musk took his boys to Maui to meet up with\nKimbal and other relatives, marking his first real vacation in a number of\nyears.\nIt was right after this holiday that Musk let me have the first substantial\nglimpse into his life. Skin still peeling off his sunburnt arms, Musk met\nwith me at the Tesla and SpaceX headquarters, at the Tesla design studio,\nand at a Beverley Hills screening of a documentary he had helped sponsor.\nThe film, Baseball in the Time of Cholera, was good but grim and explored\na cholera outbreak in Haiti. It turned out that Musk had visited Haiti the\nprevious Christmas, filling his jet with toys and MacBook Airs for an\norphanage. Bryn Mooser, the codirector of the film, told me that during a\nbarbecue Musk had taught the kids how to fire off model rockets and then\nlater went to visit a village deeper in the jungle by traveling in a dugout\ncanoe. After the screening, Musk and I hung out on the street for a bit away\nfrom the crowd. I noted aloud that everyone wants to make him out as the\nTony Stark character but that he didn\u2019t really exude that \u201cplayboy drinking\nscotch while zooming through Afghanistan in an army convoy\u201d vibe. He\nfired back, pointing to the Haitian canoe ride. \u201cI got wasted, too, on some\ndrink they call the Zombie,\u201d Musk said. He smiled and then invited me to\ngrab some drinks across the street at Mr. Chow to celebrate the movie. All\nseemed to be going well for Musk, and he savored the moment.\nThis restful period did not last long and soon enough Tesla\u2019s battle for\nsurvival resumed. The company could only produce about ten sedans per\nweek at the outset and had thousands of back orders that it needed to fulfill.\nShort sellers, those investors who bet a company\u2019s share price will fall, had", "taken huge positions in Tesla, making it the most shorted stock out of one\nhundred of the largest companies listed on the NASDAQ exchange. The\nnaysayers expected numerous Model S flaws to crop up and undermine the\nenthusiasm for the car, to the point that people started canceling their orders\nin bulk. There were also huge doubts that Tesla could ramp up production in\na meaningful way and do so profitably. In October 2012, the presidential\nhopeful Mitt Romney dubbed Tesla \u201ca loser,\u201d while slagging off a couple of\nother government-backed green technology companies (the solar panel\nmaker Solyndra and Fisker) during a debate with Barack Obama.14\nWhile the doubters placed huge wagers on Tesla\u2019s impending failure,\nMusk\u2019s bluster mode engaged. He began talking about Tesla\u2019s goals to\nbecome the most profitable major automobile maker in the world, with\nbetter margins than BMW. Then, in September 2012, he unveiled something\nthat shocked both Tesla critics and proponents alike. Tesla had secretly been\nbuilding the first leg of a network of charging stations. The company\ndisclosed the location of six stations in California, Nevada, and Arizona and\npromised that hundreds more would be on the way. Tesla intended to build a\nglobal charging network that would let Model S owners making long drives\npull off the highway and recharge very quickly. And they would be able to\ndo so for free. In fact, Musk insisted that Tesla owners would soon be able\nto travel across the United States without spending a penny on fuel. Model\nS drivers would have no trouble finding these stations, not only because the\ncars\u2019 onboard computers would guide them to the nearest one but because\nMusk and von Holzhausen had designed giant red and white monoliths to\nherald the appearance of the stations.\nThe Supercharging stations, as Tesla called them, represented a huge\ninvestment for the strapped company. An argument could easily be made\nthat spending money on this sort of thing at such a precarious moment in\nthe Model S and Tesla\u2019s history was somewhere between daft and batshit\ncrazy. Surely Musk did not have the gall to try to revamp the very idea of\nthe automobile and build an energy network at the same time with a budget\nequivalent to what Ford and ExxonMobil spend on their annual holiday\nparties. But that was the exact plan. Musk, Straubel, and others inside Tesla\nhad mapped out this all-or-nothing play long ago and built certain features\ninto the Model S with the Superchargers in mind.*\nWhile the arrival of the Model S and the charging network garnered\nTesla a ton of headlines, it remained unclear if the positive press and good", "vibes would last. Serious trade-offs had been made as Tesla rushed to get\nthe Model S to market. The car had some spectacular, novel features. But\neveryone inside of the company knew that as far as luxury sedans went, the\nModel S did not match up feature to feature with cars from BMW and\nMercedes-Benz. The first few thousand Model S cars, for example, would\nship without the parking sensors and radar-assisted cruise control common\non other high-end cars. \u201cIt was either hire a team of fifty people right away\nto make one of these things happen or implement things as best and as fast\nas you could,\u201d Javidan said.\nThe subpar fit and finish also proved hard to explain. The early adopters\ncould tolerate a windshield wiper going haywire for a couple of days, but\nthey wanted to see seats and visors that met the $100,000 price tag. While\nTesla did its best to source the highest-quality materials, it struggled at\ntimes to convince the top suppliers to take the company seriously.15 \u201cPeople\nwere very suspect that we would deliver one thousand Model Ss,\u201d said von\nHolzhausen. \u201cIt was frustrating because we had the drive internally to make\nthe car perfect but could not get the same commitment externally. With\nsomething like the visor, we ended up having to go to a third-rate supplier\nand then work on fixing the situation after the car had already started\nshipping.\u201d The cosmetic issues, though, were minor compared to a\ntumultuous set of internal circumstances, revealed in detail here for the first\ntime, that threatened to bankrupt the company once again.\nMusk had hired George Blankenship, a former Apple executive, to run\nits stores and service-center operations. At Apple, Blankenship worked just\na couple of doors down from Steve Jobs and received credit for building\nmuch of the Apple Store strategy. When Tesla first hired Blankenship, the\npress and public were atwitter, anticipating that\u2019d he do something\nspectacular and at odds with the traditions of the automotive industry.\nBlankenship did some of that. He expanded Tesla\u2019s number of stores\nthroughout the world and imbued them with that Apple Store vibe. Along\nwith showcasing the Model S, the Tesla stores sold hoodies and hats and\nhad areas in the back where kids would find crayons and Tesla coloring\nbooks. Blankenship gave me a tour of the Tesla store on Santana Row, the\nglitzy shopping center in San Jose. He came off as a warm, grandfatherly\nsort who saw Tesla as his chance to make a difference. \u201cThe typical dealer\nwants to sell you a car on the spot to clear inventory off his lot,\u201d\nBlankenship said. \u201cThe goal here is to develop a relationship with Tesla and", "electric vehicles.\u201d Tesla, he said, wanted to turn the Model S into more than\na car. Ideally it would be an object of desire just like the iPod and iPhone.\nBlankenship noted that Tesla had more than ten thousand reservations for\nthe Model S at the time, the vast majority of which had arrived without the\ncustomers test-driving the car. A lot of this early interest resulted from the\naura surrounding Musk, who Blankenship said came off as similar to Jobs\nbut with a toned-down control-freak vibe. \u201cThis is the first place I have\nworked that is going to change the world,\u201d Blankenship said, taking a jab at\nthe sometimes trivial nature of Apple\u2019s gadgets.\nWhile Musk and Blankenship got along at first, their relationship fell\napart during the latter stages of 2012. Tesla did have a large number of\nreservations in which people put down $5,000 for the right to buy a Model\nS and get in the purchase queue. But the company had struggled to turn\nthese reservations into actual sales. The reasons behind this problem remain\nunclear. It may have been that the complaints about the interior and the\nearly kinks mentioned on the Tesla forums and message boards were\ncausing concerns. Tesla also lacked financing options to soften the blow of\nbuying a $100,000 car, while uncertainty surrounded the resale market for\nthe Model S. You might end up with the car of the future or you might\nspend six figures on a dud with a battery pack that loses its capacity, and\nwith no secondary buyer. Tesla\u2019s service centers at the time were also\nterrible. The early cars were unreliable and customers were being sent in\ndroves to centers unprepared to handle the volume. Many prospective Tesla\nowners likely wanted to hang out on the sidelines for a bit longer to make\nsure that the company would remain viable. As Musk put it, \u201cThe word of\nmouth on the car sucked.\u201d\nBy the middle of February 2013, Tesla had fallen into a crisis state. If it\ncould not convert its reservations to purchases quickly, its factory would sit\nidle, costing the company vast amounts of money. And if anyone caught\nwind of the factory slowdown, Tesla\u2019s shares would likely plummet,\nprospective owners would become even more cautious, and the short sellers\nwould win. The severity of this problem had been hidden from Musk, but\nonce he learned about it, he acted in his signature all-or-nothing fashion.\nMusk pulled people from recruiting, the design studio, engineering, finance,\nand wherever else he could find them and ordered them to get on the phone,\ncall people with reservations, and close deals. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deliver these\ncars, we are fucked,\u201d Musk told the employees. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t care what job", "you were doing. Your new job is delivering cars.\u201d He placed Jerome\nGuillen, a former Daimler executive, in charge of fixing the service issues.\nMusk fired senior leaders whom he deemed subpar performers and\npromoted a flood of junior people who had been doing above-average work.\nHe also made an announcement personally guaranteeing the resale price of\nthe Model S. Customers would be able to resell their cars for the average\ngoing rate of similar luxury sedans with Musk putting his billions behind\nthis pledge. And then Musk tried to orchestrate the ultimate fail-safe for\nTesla just in case his maneuvers did not work.\nDuring the first week of April, Musk reached out to his friend Larry\nPage at Google. According to people familiar with their discussion, Musk\nvoiced his concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to survive the next few weeks. Not\nonly were customers failing to convert their reservations to orders at the rate\nMusk hoped, but existing customers had also started to defer their orders as\nthey heard about upcoming features and new color choices. The situation\ngot so bad that Tesla had to shut down its factory. Publicly, Tesla said it\nneeded to conduct maintenance on the factory, which was technically true,\nalthough the company would have soldiered on had the orders been closing\nas expected. Musk explained all of this to Page and then struck a handshake\ndeal for Google to acquire Tesla.\nWhile Musk did not want to sell, the deal seemed like the only viable\ncourse for Tesla\u2019s future. Musk\u2019s biggest fear about an acquisition was that\nthe new owner would not see Tesla\u2019s goals through to their conclusion. He\nwanted to make sure that the company would end up producing a mass-\nmarket electric vehicle. Musk proposed terms under which he would remain\nin control of Tesla for eight years or until it started pumping out a mass-\nmarket car. Musk also asked for access to $5 billion in capital for factory\nexpansions. Some of Google\u2019s lawyers were put off by these demands, but\nMusk and Page continued to talk about the deal. Given Tesla\u2019s value at the\ntime, it was thought that Google would need to pay about $6 billion for the\ncompany.\nAs Musk, Page, and Google\u2019s lawyers debated the parameters of an\nacquisition, a miracle happened. The five hundred or so people whom Musk\nhad turned into car salesmen quickly sold a huge volume of cars. Tesla,\nwhich only had a couple weeks of cash left in the bank, moved enough cars\nin the span of about fourteen days to end up with a blowout first fiscal\nquarter. Tesla stunned Wall Street on May 8, 2013, by posting its first-ever", "profit as a public company\u2014$11 million\u2014on $562 million in sales. It\ndelivered 4,900 Model S sedans during the period. This announcement sent\nTesla\u2019s shares soaring from about $30 a share to $130 per share in July. Just\na couple of weeks after revealing the first-quarter results, Tesla paid off its\n$465 million loan from the government early and with interest. Tesla\nsuddenly appeared to have vast cash reserves at its disposal, and the short\nsellers were forced to take massive losses. The solid performance of the\nstock increased consumers\u2019 confidence, creating a virtuous circle for Tesla.\nWith cars selling and Tesla\u2019s value rising, the deal with Google was no\nlonger necessary, and Tesla had become too expensive to buy. The talks\nwith Google ended.*\nWhat transpired next was the Summer of Musk. Musk put his public\nrelations staff on high alert, telling them that he wanted to try to have one\nTesla announcement per week. The company never quite lived up to that\npace, but it did issue statement after statement. Musk held a series of press\nconferences that addressed financing for the Model S, the construction of\nmore charging stations, and the opening of more retail stores. During one\nannouncement, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s charging stations were solar-\npowered and had batteries on-site to store extra juice. \u201cI was joking that\neven if there\u2019s some zombie apocalypse, you\u2019ll still be able to travel\nthroughout the country using the Tesla Supercharger system,\u201d Musk said,\nsetting the bar very high for CEOs at other automakers. But the biggest\nevent by far was held in Los Angeles, where Tesla unveiled another secret\nfeature of the Model S.\nIn June 2013, Tesla cleared the prototype vehicles out of its Los\nAngeles design studio and invited Tesla owners and the media for a flashy\nevening soiree. Hundreds of people showed up, driving their pricey Model\nS sedans through the grungy streets of Hawthorne and parking in between\nthe design studio and the SpaceX factory. The studio had been converted\ninto a lounge. The lighting was dim, and the floor had been covered in\nAstroTurf and tiered to make plateaus where people could mingle or plop\ndown on couches. Women in tight black dresses cruised through the crowd,\nserving drinks. Daft Punk\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d played on the sound system. A\nstage had been built at the front of the room, but before Musk ascended it he\nmingled with the masses. It was clear that he had become a rock star for\nTesla owners\u2014every bit the equivalent of Steve Jobs for the Apple faithful.", "People surrounded him and asked to take pictures. Meanwhile, Straubel\nstood off to the side, often totally alone.\nAfter people had a couple of drinks, Musk fought through the crowd to\nthe front of the room, where old TV commercials projected onto a screen\nabove the stage showed families stopping by Esso and Chevron stations.\nThe kids were so happy to see the Esso tiger mascot. \u201cGas is a weird thing\nto love,\u201d Musk said. \u201cHonestly.\u201d That\u2019s when he brought a Model S up\nonstage. A hole opened up in the floor beneath the car. It had been possible\nall along, Musk said, to replace the battery pack underneath the Model S in\na matter of seconds\u2014the company just hadn\u2019t told anyone about this. Tesla\nwould now start adding battery swapping at its charging stations as a\nquicker option to recharging. Someone could drive right over a pit where a\nrobot would take off the car\u2019s battery pack and install a new one in ninety\nseconds, at a cost equivalent to filling up with a tank of gas. \u201cThe only\ndecision that you have to make when you come to one of our Tesla stations\nis do you prefer faster or free,\u201d Musk said.*\nIn the months that followed, a couple of events threatened to derail the\nSummer of Musk. The New York Times penned a withering review of the\ncar and its charging stations, and a couple of the Model S sedans caught fire\nafter being involved in collisions. Disobeying conventional public relations\nwisdom, Musk went after the reporter, using data pulled from the car to\nundermine the reviewer\u2019s claims. Musk penned the feisty rebuttal himself,\nwhile on vacation in Aspen with Kimbal, and friend and Tesla board\nmember Antonio Gracias. \u201cAt some other company, it would be a public\nrelations group putting something like this together,\u201d Gracias said. \u201cElon\nfelt like it was the most important problem facing Tesla at the time and\nthat\u2019s always what he deals with and how he prioritizes. It could kill the car\nand represented an existential threat against the business. Have there been\nmoments where his unconventional style in these types of situations has\nmade me cringe? Yes. But I trust that it will work out in the end.\u201d Musk\napplied a similar approach to dealing with the fires by declaring the Model\nS the safest car in America in a press release and adding a titanium\nunderbody shield and aluminum plates to the vehicle to deflect and destroy\ndebris and keep the battery pack safe.16\nThe fires, the occasional bad review\u2014none of this had any effect on\nTesla\u2019s sales or share price. Musk\u2019s star shone brighter and brighter as\nTesla\u2019s market value ballooned to about half that of GM and Ford.", "Tesla held another press event in October 2014 that cemented Musk\u2019s\nplace as the new titan of the auto industry. Musk unveiled a supercharged\nversion of the Model S with two motors\u2014one in the front and one in the\nback. It could go zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds. The company had turned a\nsedan into a supercar. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking off from a carrier deck,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just bananas.\u201d Musk also unveiled a new suite of software for the\nModel S that gave it autopilot functions. The car had radar to detect objects\nand warn of possible collisions and could guide itself via GPS. \u201cLater, you\nwill be able to summon the car,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt will come to wherever you\nare. There\u2019s also something else I would like to do. Many of our engineers\nwill be hearing this in real time. I would like the charge connector to plug\nitself into the car, sort of like an articulating snake. I think we will probably\ndo something like that.\u201d\nThousands of people waited in line for hours to see Musk demonstrate\nthis technology. Musk cracked jokes during the presentation and played off\nthe crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. The man who had been awkward in front of media\nduring the PayPal years had developed a unique, slick stagecraft. A woman\nstanding next to me in the crowd went weak in the knees when Musk first\ntook the stage. A man to my other side said he wanted a Model X and had\njust offered $15,000 to a friend to move up on the reservation list, so that he\ncould end up with model No. 700. The enthusiasm coupled with Musk\u2019s\nability to generate attention was emblematic of just how far the little\nautomaker and its eccentric CEO had come. Rival car companies would kill\nto receive such interest and had basically been left dumbfounded as Tesla\nsnuck up on them and delivered more than they had ever imagined possible.\nAs the Model S fever gripped Silicon Valley, I visited Ford\u2019s small\nresearch and development lab in Palo Alto. The head of the lab at the time\nwas a ponytailed, sandal-wearing engineer named T. J. Giuli, who felt very\njealous of Tesla. Inside of every Ford were dozens of computing systems\nmade by different companies that all had to speak to each other and work as\none. It was a mess of complexity that had evolved over time, and\nsimplifying the situation would prove near impossible at this point,\nespecially for a company like Ford, which needed to pump out hundreds of\nthousands of cars per year and could not afford to stop and reboot. Tesla, by\ncontrast, got to start from scratch and make its own software the focus of\nthe Model S. Giuli would have loved the same opportunity. \u201cSoftware is in\nmany ways the heart of the new vehicle experience,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the", "powertrain to the warning chimes in the car, you\u2019re using software to create\nan expressive and pleasing environment. The level of integration that the\nsoftware has into the rest of the Model S is really impressive. Tesla is a\nbenchmark for what we do here.\u201d Not long after this chat, Giuli left Ford to\nbecome an engineer at a stealth start-up.\nThere was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla\ndown. But that didn\u2019t stop executives from trying to be difficult whenever\npossible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its third-generation car the\nModel E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E, and X\u2014\nanother playful Musk gag. But Ford\u2019s then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked\nTesla from using Model E, with the threat of a lawsuit. \u201cSo I call up\nMulally and I was like, \u2018Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you really\ngoing to do a Model E?\u2019\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure which is worse.\nYou know? Like it would actually make more sense if they\u2019re just fucking\nwith us because if they actually come out with a Model E at this point, and\nwe\u2019ve got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with the Model E, it\u2019s\ngoing to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred\nyears ago, nobody thinks of \u2018Model\u2019 as being a Ford thing anymore. So it\nwould just feel like they stole it. Like why did you go steal Tesla\u2019s E? Like\nyou\u2019re some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of\nSesame Street robber. And he was like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re definitely going to\nuse it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea because\npeople are going to be confused because it\u2019s not going to make sense.\nPeople aren\u2019t used to Ford having Model something these days. It\u2019s usually\ncalled like the Ford Fusion.\u2019 And he was like, no, his guys really want to\nuse that. That\u2019s terrible.\u201d After that, Tesla registered the trademark for\nModel Y as another joke. \u201cIn fact, Ford called us up deadpan and said, \u2018We\nsee you\u2019ve registered Model Y. Is that what you\u2019re going to use instead of\nthe Model E?\u2019\u201d Musk said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, it\u2019s a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does\nthat spell?\u2019 But trademark law is a dry profession it turns out.\u201d*\nWhat Musk had done that the rival automakers missed or didn\u2019t have\nthe means to combat was turn Tesla into a lifestyle. It did not just sell\nsomeone a car. It sold them an image, a feeling they were tapping into the\nfuture, a relationship. Apple did the same thing decades ago with the Mac\nand then again with the iPod and iPhone. Even those who were not religious\nabout their affiliation to Apple were sucked into its universe once they\nbought the hardware and downloaded software like iTunes.", "This sort of relationship is hard to pull off if you don\u2019t control as much\nof the lifestyle as possible. PC makers that farmed their software out to\nMicrosoft, their chips to Intel, and their design to Asia could never make\nmachines as beautiful and as complete as Apple\u2019s. They also could not\nrespond in time as Apple took this expertise to new areas and hooked\npeople on its applications.\nYou can see Musk\u2019s embrace of the car as lifestyle in Tesla\u2019s\nabandonment of model years. Tesla does not designate cars as being 2014s\nor 2015s, and it also doesn\u2019t have \u201call the 2014s in stock must go, go, go\nand make room for the new cars\u201d sales. It produces the best Model S it can\nat the time, and that\u2019s what the customer receives. This means that Tesla\ndoes not develop and hold on to a bunch of new features over the course of\nthe year and then unleash them in a new model all at once. It adds features\none by one to the manufacturing line when they\u2019re ready. Some customers\nmay be frustrated to miss out on a feature here and there. Tesla, however,\nmanages to deliver most of the upgrades as software updates that everyone\ngets, providing current Model S owners with pleasant surprises.\nFor the Model S owner, the all-electric lifestyle translates into a less\nhassled existence. Instead of going to the gas station, you just plug the car\nin at night, a rhythm familiar to anyone with a smartphone. The car will\nstart charging right away or the owner can tap into the Model S\u2019s software\nand schedule charging to take place late at night, when the cheapest\nelectricity rates are available. Tesla owners not only dodge gas stations;\nthey mostly get to skip out on visits to mechanics. A traditional vehicle\nneeds oil and transmission fluid changes to deal with all the friction and\nwear and tear produced by its thousands of moving parts. The simpler\nelectric car design eliminates this type of maintenance. Both the Roadster\nand the Model S also take advantage of what\u2019s known as regenerative\nbraking, which extends the life of the brakes. During stop-and-go situations,\nthe Tesla will brake by kicking the motor into reverse via software and\nslowing down the wheels instead of using brake pads and friction to clamp\nthem down. The Tesla motor generates electricity during this process and\nfunnels it back to the batteries, which is why electric cars get better mileage\nin city traffic. Tesla still recommends that owners bring in the Model S once\na year for a checkup but that\u2019s mostly to give the vehicle a once-over and\nmake sure that none of the components seems to be wearing down\nprematurely.", "Even Tesla\u2019s approach to maintenance is philosophically different from\nthat of the traditional automotive industry. Most car dealers make the\nmajority of their profits from servicing cars. They treat vehicles like a\nsubscription service, expecting people to visit their service centers multiple\ntimes a year for many years. This is the main reason dealerships have\nfought to block Tesla from selling its cars directly to consumers.* \u201cThe\nultimate goal is to never have to bring your car back in after you buy it,\u201d\nsaid Javidan. The dealers charge more than independent mechanics but give\npeople the peace of mind that their car is being worked on by a specialist\nfor a particular make of vehicle. Tesla makes its profits off the initial sale of\nthe car and then from some optional software services. \u201cI got the number\nten Model S,\u201d said Konstantin Othmer,17 the Silicon Valley software whiz\nand entrepreneur. \u201cIt was an awesome car, but it had just about every issue\nyou might have read about in the forums. They would fix all these things\nand decided to trailer the car back to the shop so that they didn\u2019t add any\nmiles to it. Then I went in for a one-year service, and they spruced up\neverything so that the car was better than new. It was surrounded by velvet\nropes in the service center. It was just beautiful.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s model isn\u2019t just about being an affront to the way carmakers and\ndealers do business. It\u2019s a more subtle play on how electric cars represent a\nnew way to think of automobiles. All car companies will soon follow\nTesla\u2019s lead and offer some form of over-the-air updates to their vehicles.\nThe practicality and scope of their updates will be limited, however. \u201cYou\njust can\u2019t do an over-the-air sparkplug change or replacement of the timing\nbelt,\u201d said Javidan. \u201cWith a gas car, you have to get under the hood at some\npoint and that forces you back to the dealership anyway. There\u2019s no real\nincentive for Mercedes to say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to bring the car in,\u2019 because\nit\u2019s not true.\u201d Tesla also has the edge of having designed so many of the key\ncomponents for its cars in-house, including the software running throughout\nthe vehicle. \u201cIf Daimler wants to change the way a gauge looks, it has to\ncontact a supplier half a world away and then wait for a series of\napprovals,\u201d Javidan said. \u201cIt would take them a year to change the way the\n\u2018P\u2019 on the instrument panel looks. At Tesla, if Elon decides he wants a\npicture of a bunny rabbit on every gauge for Easter, he can have that done in\na couple of hours.\u201d*\nAs Tesla turned into a star of modern American industry, its closest\nrivals were obliterated. Fisker Automotive filed for bankruptcy and was", "bought by a Chinese auto parts company in 2014. One of its main investors\nwas Ray Lane, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\nLane had cost Kleiner Perkins a chance to invest in Tesla and then backed\nFisker\u2014a disastrous move that tarnished the firm\u2019s brand and Lane\u2019s\nreputation. Better Place was another start-up that enjoyed more hype than\nFisker and Tesla put together and raised close to $1 billion to build electric\ncars and battery-swapping stations.18 The company never produced much of\nanything and declared bankruptcy in 2013.\nThe guys like Straubel who had been at Tesla since the beginning are\nquick to remind people that the chance to build an awesome electric car had\nbeen there all along. \u201cIt\u2019s not really like there was a rush to this idea, and\nwe got there first,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cIt is frequently forgotten in hindsight that\npeople thought this was the shittiest business opportunity on the planet. The\nventure capitalists were all running for the hills.\u201d What separated Tesla\nfrom the competition was the willingness to charge after its vision without\ncompromise, a complete commitment to execute to Musk\u2019s standards.", "11", "THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY OF ELON\nMUSK\nT\nHE RIVE BROTHERS USED TO BE LIKE A TECHNOLOGY GANG.\nIn the late 1990s, they would jump on skateboards and zip around the\nstreets of Santa Cruz, knocking on the doors of businesses and asking if\nthey needed any help managing their computing systems. The young men,\nwho had all grown up in South Africa with their cousin Elon Musk, soon\ndecided there must be an easier way to hawk their technology smarts than\ngoing door-to-door. They wrote some software that allowed them to take\ncontrol of their clients\u2019 systems from afar and to automate many of the\nstandard tasks that companies required, such as installing updates for\napplications. The software became the basis of a new company called\nEverdream, and the brothers promoted their technology in some compelling\nways. Billboards went up around Silicon Valley in which Lyndon Rive, a\nbuff underwater hockey player,* stood naked with his pants around his\nankles, while holding a computer in front of his crotch. Up above his photo,\nthe tagline for the ad read, \u201cDon\u2019t get caught with your systems down.\u201d\nBy 2004, Lyndon and his brothers, Peter and Russ, wanted a new\nchallenge\u2014something that not only made them money but, as Lyndon put\nit, \u201csomething that made us feel good every single day.\u201d Near the end of the\nsummer that year, Lyndon rented an RV and set out with Musk for the\nBlack Rock desert and the madness of Burning Man. The men used to go on\nadventures all the time when they were kids and looked forward to the long\ndrive as a way to catch up and brainstorm about their businesses. Musk\nknew that Lyndon and his brothers were angling for something big. While\ndriving, Musk turned to Lyndon and suggested that he look into the solar\nenergy market. Musk had studied it a bit and thought there were some\nopportunities that others had missed. \u201cHe said it was a good place to get\ninto,\u201d Lyndon recalled.\nAfter arriving at Burning Man, Musk, a regular at the event, and his\nfamily went through their standard routines. They set up camp and prepped", "their art car for a drive. This year, they had cut the roof off a small car,\nelevated the steering wheel, shifted it to the right so that it was placed near\nthe middle of the vehicle, and replaced the seats with a couch. Musk took a\nlot of pleasure in driving the funky creation.19 \u201cElon likes to see the\nrawness of people there,\u201d said Bill Lee, his longtime friend. \u201cIt\u2019s his version\nof camping. He wants to go and drive the art cars and see installations and\nthe great light shows. He dances a lot.\u201d Musk put on a display of strength\nand determination at the event as well. There was a wooden pole perhaps\nthirty feet high with a dancing platform at the top. Dozens of people tried\nand failed to climb it, and then Musk gave it a go. \u201cHis technique was very\nawkward, and he should not have succeeded,\u201d said Lyndon. \u201cBut he hugged\nit and just inched up and inched up until he reached the top.\u201d\nMusk and the Rives left Burning Man enthused. The Rives decided to\nbecome experts on the solar industry and find the opportunity in the market.\nThey spent two years studying solar technology and the dynamics of the\nbusiness, reading research reports, interviewing people, and attending\nconferences along the way. It was during the Solar Power International\nconference that the Rive brothers really hit on what their business model\nmight be. Only about two thousand* people showed up for the event, and\nthey all fit into a couple of hotel conference rooms for presentations and\npanels. During one open discussion session, representatives from a handful\nof the world\u2019s largest solar installers were sitting onstage, and the moderator\nasked what they were doing to make solar panels more affordable for\nconsumers. \u201cThey all gave the same answer,\u201d Lyndon said. \u201cThey said,\n\u2018We\u2019re waiting for the cost of the panels to drop.\u2019 None of them were taking\nownership of the problem.\u201d\nAt the time, it was not easy for consumers to get solar panels on their\nhouses. You had to be very proactive, acquiring the panels and finding\nsomeone else to install them. The consumer paid up front and had to make\nan educated guess as to whether or not his or her house even got enough\nsunshine to make the ordeal worthwhile. On top of all this, people were\nreluctant to buy panels, knowing that the next year\u2019s models would be more\nefficient.\nThe Rives decided to make buying into the solar proposition much\nsimpler and formed a company called SolarCity in 2006. Unlike other\ncompanies, they would not manufacture their own solar panels. Instead they\nwould buy them and then do just about everything else in-house. They built", "software for analyzing a customer\u2019s current energy bill and the position of\ntheir house and the amount of sunlight it typically received to determine if\nsolar made sense for the property. They built up their own teams to install\nthe solar panels. And they created a financing system in which the customer\ndid not need to pay anything up front for the panels. The consumer leased\nthe panels over a number of years at a fixed monthly rate. Consumers got a\nlower bill overall, they were no longer subject to the constantly rising rates\nof typical utilities, and, if they sold their house, they could pass the contract\nto the new owner. At the end of the lease, the homeowner could also\nupgrade to new, more efficient panels. Musk had helped his cousins come\nup with this structure and become the company\u2019s chairman and its largest\nshareholder, owning about a third of SolarCity.\nSix years later, SolarCity had become the largest installer of solar panels\nin the country. The company had lived up to its initial goals and made\ninstalling the panels painless. Rivals were rushing to mimic its business\nmodel. SolarCity had benefited along the way from a collapse in the price\nof solar panels, which occurred after Chinese panel manufacturers flooded\nthe market with product. It had also expanded its business from consumers\nto businesses with companies like Intel, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart signing\nup for large installations. In 2012, SolarCity went public and its shares\nsoared higher in the months that followed. By 2014, SolarCity was valued\nat close to $7 billion.\nDuring the entire period of SolarCity\u2019s growth, Silicon Valley had\ndumped huge amounts of money into green technology companies with\nmostly disastrous results. There were the automotive flubs like Fisker and\nBetter Place, and Solyndra, the solar cell maker that conservatives loved to\nhold up as a cautionary tale of government spending and cronyism run\namok. Some of the most famous venture capitalists in history, like John\nDoerr and Vinod Khosla, were ripped apart by the local and national press\nfor their failed green investments. The story was almost always the same.\nPeople had thrown money at green technology because it seemed like the\nright thing to do, not because it made business sense. From new kinds of\nenergy storage systems to electric cars and solar panels, the technology\nnever quite lived up to its billing and required too much government\nfunding and too many incentives to create a viable market. Much of this\ncriticism was fair. It\u2019s just that there was this Elon Musk guy hanging\naround who seemed to have figured something out that everyone else had", "missed. \u201cWe had a blanket rule against investing in clean-tech companies\nfor about a decade,\u201d said Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and venture\ncapitalist at Founders Fund. \u201cOn the macro level, we were right because\nclean tech as a sector was quite bad. But on the micro level, it looks like\nElon has the two most successful clean-tech companies in the U.S. We\nwould rather explain his success as being a fluke. There\u2019s the whole Iron\nMan thing in which he\u2019s presented as a cartoonish businessman\u2014this very\nunusual animal at the zoo. But there is now a degree to which you have to\nask whether his success is an indictment on the rest of us who have been\nworking on much more incremental things. To the extent that the world still\ndoubts Elon, I think it\u2019s a reflection on the insanity of the world and not on\nthe supposed insanity of Elon.\u201d\nSolarCity, like the rest of Musk\u2019s ventures, did not represent a business\nopportunity so much as it represented a worldview. Musk had decided long\nago\u2014in his very rational manner\u2014that solar made sense. Enough solar\nenergy hits the Earth\u2019s surface in about an hour to equal a year\u2019s worth of\nworldwide energy consumption from all sources put together.20\nImprovements in the efficiency of solar panels have been happening at a\nsteady clip. If solar is destined to be mankind\u2019s preferred energy source in\nthe future, then this future ought to be brought about as quickly as possible.\nStarting in 2014, SolarCity began to make the full extent of its\nambitions more obvious. First, the company began selling energy storage\nsystems. These units were built through a partnership with Tesla Motors.\nBattery packs were manufactured at the Tesla factory and stacked inside\nrefrigerator-sized metal cases. Businesses and consumers could purchase\nthese storage systems to augment their solar panel arrays. Once they were\ncharged up, the battery units could be used to help large customers get\nthrough the night or during unexpected outages. Customers could also pull\nfrom the batteries instead of the grid during peak energy use periods, when\nutilities tend to tack on extra charges. While SolarCity rolled the storage\nunits out in a modest, experimental fashion, the company expects most of\nits customers to buy the systems in the years ahead to smooth out the solar\nexperience and help people and businesses leave the electrical grid\naltogether.\nThen, in June 2014, SolarCity acquired a solar cell maker called Silevo\nfor $200 million. This deal marked a huge shift in strategy. SolarCity would\nno longer buy its solar panels. It would make them at a factory in New York", "State. Silevo\u2019s cells were said to be 18.5 percent efficient at turning light\ninto energy, compared to 14.5 percent for most cells, and the expectations\nwere that the company could reach 24 percent efficiency with the right\nmanufacturing techniques. Buying, rather than manufacturing, solar panels\nhad been one of SolarCity\u2019s great advantages. It could capitalize on the glut\nin the solar cell market and avoid the large capital expenditures tied to\nbuilding and running factories. With 110,000 customers, however, SolarCity\nhad started to consume so many solar panels that it needed to ensure a\nconsistent supply and price. \u201cWe are currently installing more solar than\nmost of the companies are manufacturing,\u201d said Peter Rive, the cofounder\nand chief technology officer at SolarCity. \u201cIf we do the manufacturing\nourselves and take advantage of some different technology, our costs will be\nlower\u2014and this business has always been about lowering the costs.\u201d\nAfter adding the leases, the storage units, and the solar cell\nmanufacturing together, it became clear to close observers of SolarCity that\nthe company had morphed into something resembling a utility. It had built\nout a network of solar systems all under its control and managed by the\ncompany\u2019s software. By the end of 2015, SolarCity expects to have\ninstalled 2 gigawatts\u2019 worth of solar panels, producing 2.8 terawatt-hours of\nelectricity per year. \u201cThis would put us on a path to fulfill our goal to\nbecome one of the largest suppliers of electricity in the United States,\u201d the\ncompany said after announcing these figures in a quarterly earnings\nstatement. The reality is that SolarCity accounts for a tiny fraction of the\nUnited States\u2019 annual energy consumption and has a long way to go to\nbecome a major supplier of electricity in the country. There can, however,\nbe little doubt that Musk intends for the company to be a dominant force in\nthe solar industry and in the energy industry overall.\nWhat\u2019s more, SolarCity is a key part of what can be thought of as the\nunified field theory of Musk. Each one of his businesses is interconnected\nin the short term and the long term. Tesla makes battery packs that\nSolarCity can then sell to end customers. SolarCity supplies Tesla\u2019s\ncharging stations with solar panels, helping Tesla to provide free recharging\nto its drivers. Newly minted Model S owners regularly opt to begin living\nthe Musk Lifestyle and outfit their homes with solar panels. Tesla and\nSpaceX help each other as well. They exchange knowledge around\nmaterials, manufacturing techniques, and the intricacies of operating\nfactories that build so much stuff from the ground up.", "For most of their histories, SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX have been the\nclear underdogs in their respective markets and gone to war against deep-\npocketed, entrenched competitors. The solar, automotive, and aerospace\nindustries remain larded down by regulation and bureaucracy, which favors\nincumbents. To people in these industries Musk came off as a wide-eyed\ntechnologist who could be easily dismissed and ridiculed and who, as a\ncompetitor, fell somewhere on the spectrum between annoying and full of\nshit. The incumbents did their usual thing using their connections in\nWashington to make life as miserable as possible on all three of Musk\u2019s\ncompanies, and they were pretty good at it.\nAs of 2012, Musk Co. turned into a real threat, and it became harder to\ngo at SolarCity, Tesla, or SpaceX as individual companies. Musk\u2019s star\npower had surged and washed over all three ventures at the same time.\nWhen Tesla\u2019s shares jumped, quite often SolarCity\u2019s did, too. Similar\noptimistic feelings accompanied successful SpaceX launches. They proved\nMusk knew how to accomplish the most difficult of things, and investors\nseemed to buy in more to the risks Musk took with his other enterprises.\nThe executives and lobbyists of aerospace, energy, and automotive\ncompanies were suddenly going up against a rising star of big business\u2014an\nindustrialist celebrity. Some of Musk\u2019s opponents started to fear being on\nthe wrong side of history or at least the wrong side of his glow. Others\nbegan playing really dirty.\nMusk has spent years buttering up the Democrats. He\u2019s visited the\nWhite House several times and has the ear of President Obama. Musk,\nhowever, is not a blind loyalist. He first and foremost backs the beliefs\nbehind Musk Co. and then uses any pragmatic means at his disposal to\nadvance his cause. Musk plays the part of the ruthless industrialist with a\nfierce capitalist streak better than most Republicans and has the credentials\nto back it up and earn support. The politicians in states like Alabama\nlooking to protect some factory jobs for Lockheed or in New Jersey trying\nto help out the automobile dealership lobby now have to contend with a guy\nwho has an employment and manufacturing empire spread across the entire\nUnited States. As of this writing, SpaceX had a factory in Los Angeles, a\nrocket test facility in central Texas, and had just started construction on a\nspaceport in South Texas. (SpaceX does a lot of business at existing launch\nsites in California and Florida, as well.) Tesla had its car factory in Silicon\nValley, the design center in Los Angeles, and had started construction on a", "battery factory in Nevada. (Politicians from Nevada, Texas, California, New\nMexico, and Arizona threw themselves at Musk over the battery factory,\nwith Nevada ultimately winning the business by offering Tesla $1.4 billion\nin incentives. This event confirmed not only Musk\u2019s soaring celebrity but\nalso his unmatched ability to raise funds.) SolarCity has created thousands\nof white- and blue-collar clean-tech jobs, and it will create manufacturing\njobs at the solar panel factory that\u2019s being built in Buffalo, New York. All\ntogether, Musk Co. employed about fifteen thousand people at the end of\n2014. Far from stopping there, the plan for Musk Co. calls for tens of\nthousands of more jobs to be created on the back of ever more ambitious\nproducts.\nTesla\u2019s primary focus throughout 2015 will be bringing the Model X to\nmarket. Musk expects the SUV to sell at least as well as the Model S and\nwants Tesla\u2019s factories to be capable of making 100,000 cars per year by the\nend of 2015 to keep up with demand for both vehicles. The major downside\naccompanying the Model X is its price. The SUV will start at the same lofty\nprices as the Model S, which limits the potential customer base. The hope,\nthough, is that the Model X turns into the luxury vehicle of choice for\nfamilies and solidifies the Tesla brand\u2019s connection with women. Musk has\npledged that the Supercharger network, service centers, and the battery-\nswap stations will be built out even more in 2015 to greet the arrival of the\nnew vehicle. Beyond the Model X, Tesla has started work on the second\nversion of the Roadster, talked about making a truck, and, in all seriousness,\nhas begun modeling a type of submarine car that could transition from road\nto water. Musk paid $1 million for the Lotus Esprit that Roger Moore drove\nunderwater in The Spy Who Loved Me and wants to prove that such a\nvehicle can be done. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make two or three, but it wouldn\u2019t be\nmore than that,\u201d Musk told the Independent newspaper. \u201cI think the market\nfor submarine cars is quite small.\u201d\nAt the opposite end of the sales spectrum, or so Musk hopes, will be\nTesla\u2019s third-generation car, or the Model 3. Due out in 2017, this four-door\ncar would come in around $35,000 and be the real measure of Tesla\u2019s\nimpact on the world. The company hopes to sell hundreds of thousands of\nthe Model 3 and make electric cars truly mainstream. For comparison,\nBMW sells about 300,000 Minis and 500,000 of its BMW 3 Series vehicles\nper year. Tesla would look to match those figures. \u201cI think Tesla is going to", "make a lot of cars,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf we continue on the current growth rate, I\nthink Tesla will be one of the most valuable companies in the world.\u201d\nTesla already consumes a huge portion of the world\u2019s lithium ion battery\nsupply and will need far more batteries to produce the Model 3. This is why,\nin 2014, Musk announced plans to build what he dubbed the Gigafactory, or\nthe world\u2019s largest lithium ion manufacturing facility. Each Gigafactory will\nemploy about 6,500 people and help Tesla meet a variety of goals. It should\nfirst allow Tesla to keep up with the battery demand created by its cars and\nthe storage units sold by SolarCity. Tesla also expects to be able to lower\nthe costs of its batteries while improving their energy density. It will build\nthe Gigafactory in conjunction with longtime battery partner Panasonic, but\nit will be Tesla that is running the factory and fine-tuning its operations.\nAccording to Straubel, the battery packs coming out of the Gigafactory\nshould be dramatically cheaper and better than the ones built today,\nallowing Tesla not only to hit the $35,000 price target for the Model 3 but\nalso to pave the way for electric vehicles with 500-plus miles of range.\nIf Tesla actually can deliver an affordable car with 500 miles of range, it\nwill have built what many people in the auto industry insisted for years was\nimpossible. To do that while also constructing a worldwide network of free\ncharging stations, revamping the way cars are sold, and revolutionizing\nautomotive technology would be an exceptional feat in the history of\ncapitalism.\nIn early 2014, Tesla raised $2 billion by selling bonds. Tesla\u2019s ability to\nraise money from eager investors was a newfound luxury. Tesla had\nbordered on bankruptcy for much of its existence and been one major\ntechnical gaffe from obsolescence at all times. The money coupled with\nTesla\u2019s still-rising share price and strong sales has put the company in a\nposition to open lots of new stores and service centers while advancing its\nmanufacturing capabilities. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need all of the money for\nthe Gigafactory right now, but I decided to raise it in advance because you\nnever know when there will be some bloody meltdown,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThere\ncould be external factors or there could be some unexpected recall and then\nsuddenly we need to raise money on top of dealing with that. I feel a bit like\nmy grandmother. She lived through the Great Depression and some real\nhard times. Once you\u2019ve been through that, it stays with you for a long\ntime. I\u2019m not sure it ever leaves really. So, I do feel joy now, but there\u2019s still\nthat nagging feeling that it might all go away. Even later in life when my", "grandmother knew there was really no possibility of her going hungry, she\nalways had this thing about food. With Tesla, I decided to raise a huge\namount of money just in case something terrible happens.\u201d\nMusk felt optimistic enough about Tesla\u2019s future to talk to me about\nsome of his more whimsical plans. He hopes to redesign the Tesla\nheadquarters in Palo Alto, a change employees would welcome. The\nbuilding, with its tiny, 1980s-era lobby and a kitchen that can barely handle\na few people making cereal21 at the same time, has none of the perks of a\ntypical Silicon Valley darling. \u201cI think our Tesla headquarters looks like\ncrap,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spruce things up. Not to sort of the\nGoogle level. You have to be like making money hand over fist in order to\nbe able to spend money the way that Google does. But we\u2019re going to make\nour headquarters much nicer and put in a restaurant.\u201d Naturally, Musk had\nideas for some mechanical enhancements as well. \u201cEverybody around here\nhas slides in their lobbies,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m actually wondering about putting\nin a roller coaster\u2014like a functional roller coaster at the factory in Fremont.\nYou\u2019d get in, and it would take you around factory but also up and down.\nWho else has a roller coaster? I\u2019m thinking about doing that with SpaceX,\ntoo. That one might be even bigger since SpaceX has like ten buildings\nnow. It would probably be really expensive, but I like the idea of it.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is that Musk remains willing to lose it all. He doesn\u2019t\nwant to build just one Gigafactory but several. And he needs these facilities\nto be built quickly and flawlessly, so that they\u2019re cranking out massive\nquantities of batteries right as the Model 3 arrives. If need be, Musk will\nbuild a second Gigafactory to compete with the Nevada site and place his\nown employees in competition with each other in a race to make the\nbatteries first. \u201cWe\u2019re not really trying to sort of yank anyone\u2019s chain here,\u201d\nMusk said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like this thing needs to be completed on time. If we\nsuddenly find that we\u2019re leveling the ground and laying the foundation and\nwe\u2019re on a bloody Indian burial ground, then fuck. We can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh shit.\nLet\u2019s go back to the other place that we were thinking about and get a six-\nmonth reset.\u2019 Six months for this factory is a huge deal. Do the basic math\nand it\u2019s more than a billion dollars a month in lost revenue,* assuming we\nuse it to capacity. From a different standpoint, if we spend all the money to\nprepare the car factory in Fremont to triple the volume from 150,000 per\nyear to 450,000 or 500,000 cars and hire and train all the people, and we\u2019re", "just sitting there waiting for the factory to come on line, we\u2019d be burning\nmoney like it was going out of fashion. I think that could kill the company.\n\u201cA six-month offset would be like, like Gallipoli. You have to make\nsure you charge right after the bombardment. Don\u2019t fucking sit around for\ntwo hours so that the Turks can go back in the trenches. Timing is\nimportant. We have to do everything we can to minimize the timing risk.\u201d\nWhat Musk struggles to fathom is why other automakers with deeper\npockets aren\u2019t making similar moves. At a minimum, Tesla seems to have\ninfluenced consumers and the auto industry enough for there to be an\nexpected surge in demand for electric vehicles. \u201cI think we have moved the\nneedle for almost every car company,\u201d Musk said. \u201cJust the twenty-two\nthousand cars we sold in 2013 had a highly leveraged effect in pushing the\nindustry toward sustainable technology.\u201d It\u2019s true that the supply for lithium\nion batteries is already constrained, and Tesla looks like the only company\naddressing the problem in a meaningful way.\n\u201cThe competitors are all sort of pooh-poohing the Gigafactory,\u201d Musk\nsaid. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a stupid idea, that the battery supplier should just go\nbuild something like that. But I know all the suppliers, and I can tell you\nthat they don\u2019t like the idea of spending several billion dollars on a battery\nfactory. You\u2019ve got a chicken-and-egg problem where the car companies are\nnot going to commit to a giant volume because they\u2019re not sure you can sell\nenough electric cars. So, I know we can\u2019t get enough lithium ion batteries\nunless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this\nthing.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the potential that Tesla is setting itself up to capitalize on a\nsituation like the one Apple found itself in when it first introduced the\niPhone. Apple\u2019s rivals spent the initial year after the iPhone\u2019s release\ndismissing the product. Once it became clear Apple had a hit, the\ncompetitors had to catch up. Even with the device right in their hands, it\ntook companies like HTC and Samsung years to produce anything\ncomparable. Other once-great companies like Nokia and BlackBerry didn\u2019t\nwithstand the shock. If, and it\u2019s a big if, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 turned into a\nmassive hit\u2014the thing that everyone with enough money wanted because\nbuying something else would just be paying for the past\u2014then the rival\nautomakers would be in a terrible bind. Most of the car companies dabbling\nin electric vehicles continue to buy bulky, off-the-shelf batteries rather than\ndeveloping their own technology. No matter how much they wanted to", "respond to the Model 3, the automakers would need years to come up with a\nreal challenger and even then they might not have a ready supply of\nbatteries for their vehicles.\n\u201cI think it is going to be a bit like that,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWhen will the first\nnon-Tesla Gigafactory get built? Probably no sooner than six years from\nnow. The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work\nsomewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.\nThey\u2019re probably more like seven years away. But I hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\nMusk speaks about the cars, solar panels, and batteries with such\npassion that it\u2019s easy to forget they are more or less sideline projects. He\nbelieves in the technologies to the extent that he thinks they\u2019re the right\nthings to pursue for the betterment of mankind. They\u2019ve also brought him\nfame and fortune. Musk\u2019s ultimate goal, though, remains turning humans\ninto an interplanetary species. This may sound silly to some, but there can\nbe no doubt that this is Musk\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Musk has decided that man\u2019s\nsurvival depends on setting up another colony on another planet and that he\nshould dedicate his life to making this happen.\nMusk is now quite rich on paper. He was worth about $10 billion at the\ntime of this writing. When he started SpaceX more than a decade ago,\nhowever, he had far less capital at his disposal. He didn\u2019t have the fuck-you\nmoney of a Jeff Bezos, who handed his space company Blue Origin a\nkingly pile of cash and asked it to make Bezos\u2019s dreams come true. If Musk\nwanted to get to Mars, he would have to earn it by building SpaceX into a\nreal business. This all seems to have worked in Musk\u2019s favor. SpaceX has\nlearned to make cheap and effective rockets and to push the limits of\naerospace technology.\nIn the near term, SpaceX will begin testing its ability to take people into\nspace. It wants to perform a manned test flight by 2016 and to fly astronauts\nto the International Space Station for NASA the next year. The company\nwill also likely make a major move into building and selling satellites,\nwhich would mark an expansion into one of the most lucrative parts of the\naerospace business. Along with these efforts, SpaceX has been testing the\nFalcon Heavy\u2014its giant rocket capable of flying the biggest payloads in the\nworld\u2014and its reusable-rocket technology. In early 2015, SpaceX almost\nmanaged to land the first stage of its rocket on a platform in the ocean.\nOnce it succeeds, it will begin performing tests on land.", "In 2014, SpaceX also began construction on its own spaceport in South\nTexas. It has acquired dozens of acres where it plans to construct a modern\nrocket launch facility unlike anything the world has seen. Musk wants to\nautomate a great deal of the launch process, so that the rockets can be\nrefueled, stood up, and fired on their own with computers handling the\nsafety procedures. SpaceX wants to fly rockets several times a month for its\nbusiness, and having its own spaceport should help speed up such\ncapabilities. Getting to Mars will require an even more impressive set of\nskills and technology.\n\u201cWe need to figure out how to launch multiple times a day,\u201d Musk said.\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s important in the long run is establishing a self-sustaining\nbase on Mars. In order for that to work\u2014in order to have a self-sustaining\ncity on Mars\u2014there would need to be millions of tons of equipment and\nprobably millions of people. So how many launches is that? Well, if you\nsend up 100 people at a time, which is a lot to go on such a long journey,\nyou\u2019d need to do 10,000 flights to get to a million people. So 10,000 flights\nover what period of time? Given that you can only really depart for Mars\nonce every two years, that means you would need like forty or fifty years.\n\u201cAnd then I think for each flight that departs to Mars you want to sort of\nlaunch the spacecraft into orbit and then have it be in a parking orbit and\nrefuel its tanks with propellant. Essentially, the spacecraft would use a\nbunch of its propellant to get to orbit, but then you send up a tanker\nspacecraft to fill up the propellant tanks of the spacecraft so that it can\ndepart for Mars at high speed and can do so and get there in three months\ninstead of six months and with a large payload. I don\u2019t have a detailed plan\nfor Mars but I know of something at least that would work, which is sort of\nthis all-methane system with a big booster, a spacecraft, and a tanker\npotentially. I think SpaceX will have developed a booster and spaceship in\nthe 2025 time frame capable of taking large quantities of people and cargo\nto Mars.\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s important is to reach an economic threshold around the\ncost per person for a trip to Mars. If it costs $1 billion per person, there will\nbe no Mars colony. At around $1 million or $500,000 per person, I think it\u2019s\nhighly likely that there will be a self-sustaining Martian colony. There will\nbe enough people interested who will sell their stuff on Earth and move. It\u2019s\nnot about tourism. It\u2019s like people coming to America back in the New\nWorld days. You move, get a job there, and make things work. If you solve", "the transport problem, it\u2019s not that hard to make a pressurized transparent\ngreenhouse to live in. But if you can\u2019t get there in the first place, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter.\n\u201cEventually, you\u2019d need to heat Mars up if you want it to be an\nEarthlike planet, and I don\u2019t have a plan for that. That would take a long\ntime in the best of circumstances. It would probably take, I don\u2019t know,\nsomewhere between a century and a millennium. There\u2019s zero chance of it\nbeing terraformed and Earthlike in my lifetime. Not zero, but 0.001 percent\nchance, and you would have to take real drastic measures with Mars.\u201d*\nMusk spent months pacing around his home in Los Angeles late at night\nthinking about these plans for Mars and bouncing them off Riley, whom he\nremarried near the end of 2012.* \u201cI mean, there aren\u2019t that many people you\ncan talk to about this sort of thing,\u201d Musk said. These chats included Musk\ndaydreaming aloud about becoming the first man to set foot on the Red\nPlanet. \u201cHe definitely wants to be the first man on Mars,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\nhave begged him not to be.\u201d Perhaps Musk enjoys teasing his wife or\nmaybe he\u2019s playing coy, but he denied this ambition during one of our late-\nnight chats. \u201cI would only be on the first trip to Mars if I was confident that\nSpaceX would be fine if I die,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to go, but I don\u2019t have to\ngo. The point is not about me visiting Mars but about enabling large\nnumbers of people to go to the planet.\u201d Musk may not even go into space.\nHe does not plan to participate in SpaceX\u2019s upcoming human test flights. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think that would be wise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like the head of\nBoeing being a test pilot for a new plane. It\u2019s not the right thing for SpaceX\nor the future of space exploration. I might be on there if it\u2019s been flying for\nthree or four years. Honestly, if I never go to space, that will be okay. The\npoint is to maximize the probable life span of humanity.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to gauge just how seriously the average person takes Musk\nwhen he talks like this. A few years ago, most people would have lumped\nhim into the category of people who hype up jet packs and robots and\nwhatever else Silicon Valley decided to fixate on for the moment. Then\nMusk filed away one accomplishment after another, transforming himself\nfrom big talker to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most revered doers. Thiel has\nwatched Musk go through this maturation\u2014from the driven but insecure\nCEO of PayPal to a confident CEO who commands the respect of\nthousands. \u201cI think there are ways he has dramatically improved over time,\u201d\nsaid Thiel. Most impressive to Thiel has been Musk\u2019s ability to find bright,", "ambitious people and lure them to his companies. \u201cHe has the most talented\npeople in the aerospace industry working for him, and the same case can be\nmade for Tesla, where, if you\u2019re a talented mechanical engineer who likes\nbuilding cars, then you\u2019re going to Tesla because it\u2019s probably the only\ncompany in the U.S. where you can do interesting new things. Both\ncompanies were designed with this vision of motivating a critical mass of\ntalented people to work on inspiring things.\u201d Thiel thinks Musk\u2019s goal of\ngetting humans to Mars should be taken seriously and believes it gives the\npublic hope. Not everyone will identify with the mission but the fact that\nthere\u2019s someone out there pushing exploration and our technical abilities to\ntheir limits is important. \u201cThe goal of sending a man to Mars is so much\nmore inspiring than what other people are trying to do in space,\u201d Thiel said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this going-back-to-the-future idea. There\u2019s been this long wind-down\nof the space program, and people have abandoned the optimistic visions of\nthe future that we had in the early 1970s. SpaceX shows there is a way\ntoward bringing back that future. There\u2019s great value in what Elon is\ndoing.\u201d\nThe true believers came out in full force in August 2013 when Musk\nunveiled something called the Hyperloop. Billed as a new mode of\ntransportation, this machine was a large-scale pneumatic tube like the ones\nused to send mail around offices. Musk proposed linking cities like Los\nAngeles and San Francisco via an elevated version of this kind of tube that\nwould transport people and cars in pods. Similar ideas had been proposed\nbefore, but Musk\u2019s creation had some unique elements. He called for the\ntube to run under low pressure and for the pods to float on a bed of air\nproduced by skis at their base. Each pod would be thrust forward by an\nelectromagnetic pulse, and motors placed throughout the tube would give\nthe pods added boosts as needed. These mechanisms could keep the pods\ngoing at 800 mph, allowing someone to travel from Los Angeles to San\nFrancisco in about thirty minutes. The whole thing would, of course, be\nsolar-powered and aimed at linking cities less than a thousand miles apart.\n\u201cIt makes sense for things like L.A. to San Francisco, New York to D.C.,\nNew York to Boston,\u201d Musk said at the time. \u201cOver one thousand miles, the\ntube cost starts to become prohibitive, and you don\u2019t want tubes every\nwhich way. You don\u2019t want to live in Tube Land.\u201d\nMusk had been thinking about the Hyperloop for a number of months,\ndescribing it to friends in private. The first time he talked about it to anyone", "outside of his inner circle was during one of our interviews. Musk told me\nthat the idea originated out of his hatred for California\u2019s proposed high-\nspeed rail system. \u201cThe sixty-billion-dollar bullet train they\u2019re proposing in\nCalifornia would be the slowest bullet train in the world at the highest cost\nper mile,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThey\u2019re going for records in all the wrong ways.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s high-speed rail is meant to allow people to go from Los\nAngeles to San Francisco in about two and a half hours upon its completion\nin\u2014wait for it\u20142029. It takes about an hour to fly between the cities today\nand five hours to drive, placing the train right in the zone of mediocrity,\nwhich particularly gnawed at Musk. He insisted the Hyperloop would cost\nabout $6 billion to $10 billion, go faster than a plane, and let people drive\ntheir cars onto a pod and drive out into a new city.\nAt the time, it seemed that Musk had dished out the Hyperloop proposal\njust to make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train. He\ndidn\u2019t actually intend to build the thing. It was more that he wanted to show\npeople that more creative ideas were out there for things that might actually\nsolve problems and push the state forward. With any luck, the high-speed\nrail would be canceled. Musk said as much to me during a series of e-mails\nand phone calls leading up to the announcement. \u201cDown the road, I might\nfund or advise on a Hyperloop project, but right now I can\u2019t take my eye off\nthe ball at either SpaceX or Tesla,\u201d he wrote.\nMusk\u2019s tune, however, started to change after he released the paper\ndetailing the Hyperloop. Bloomberg Businessweek had the first story on it,\nand the magazine\u2019s Web server began melting down as people stormed the\nwebsite to read about the invention. Twitter went nuts as well. About an\nhour after Musk released the information, he held a conference call to talk\nabout the Hyperloop, and somewhere in between our numerous earlier chats\nand that moment, he\u2019d decided to build the thing, telling reporters that he\nwould consider making at least a prototype to prove that the technology\ncould work. Some people had their fun with all of this. \u201cBillionaire unveils\nimaginary space train,\u201d teased Valleywag. \u201cWe love Elon Musk\u2019s nutso\ndetermination\u2014there was certainly a time when electric cars and private\nspace flight seemed silly, too. But what\u2019s sillier is treating this as anything\nother than a very rich man\u2019s wild imagination.\u201d Unlike its early Tesla-\nbashing days, Valleywag was now the minority voice. People seemed\nmainly to believe Musk could do it. The depth to which people believed it, I\nthink, surprised Musk and forced him to commit to the prototype. In a weird", "life-imitating-art moment, Musk really had become the closest thing the\nworld had to Tony Stark, and he could not let his adoring public down.\nShortly after the release of the Hyperloop plans, Shervin Pishevar, an\ninvestor and friend of Musk\u2019s, brought the detailed specifications for the\ntechnology with him during a ninety-minute meeting with President Obama\nat the White House. \u201cThe president fell in love with the idea,\u201d Pishevar\nsaid. The president\u2019s staff studied the documents and arranged a one-on-one\nwith Musk and Obama in April 2014. Since then, Pishevar, Kevin Brogan,\nand others, have formed a company called Hyperloop Technologies Inc.\nwith the hopes of building the first leg of the Hyperloop between Los\nAngeles and Las Vegas. In theory, people would be able to hop between the\ntwo cities in about ten minutes. Nevada senator Harry Reid has been briefed\non the idea as well, and efforts are under way to buy the land rights\nalongside Interstate 15 that would make the high-speed transport possible.\nFor employees like Gwynne Shotwell and J. B. Straubel, working with\nMusk means helping develop these sorts of wonderful technologies in\nrelative obscurity. They\u2019re the steady hands that will forever be expected to\nstay in the shadows. Shotwell has been a consistent presence at SpaceX\nalmost since day one, pushing the company forward and suppressing her\nego to ensure that Musk gets all the attention he desires. If you\u2019re Shotwell\nand truly believe in the cause of sending people to Mars, then the mission\ntakes precedence over personal desires. Straubel, likewise, has been the\nconstant at Tesla\u2014a go-between whom other employees could rely on to\ncarry messages to Musk, and the guy who knows everything about the cars.\nDespite his stature at the company, Straubel was one of several longtime\nemployees who confessed they were nervous to speak with me on the\nrecord. Musk likes to be the guy talking on his companies\u2019 behalf and\ncomes down hard on even his most loyal executives if they say something\ndeemed to be out of line with Musk\u2019s views or with what he wants the\npublic to think. Straubel has dedicated himself to making electric cars and\ndidn\u2019t want some dumb reporter wrecking his life\u2019s work. \u201cI try really hard\nto back away and put my ego aside,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cElon is incredibly\ndifficult to work for, but it\u2019s mostly because he\u2019s so passionate. He can be\nimpatient and say, \u2018God damn it! This is what we have to do!\u2019 and some\npeople will get shell-shocked and catatonic. It seems like people can get\nafraid of him and paralyzed in a weird way. I try to help everyone to\nunderstand what his goals and visions are, and then I have a bunch of my", "own goals, too, and make sure we\u2019re in synch. Then, I try and go back and\nmake sure the company is aligned. Ultimately, Elon is the boss. He has\ndriven this thing with his blood, sweat, and tears. He has risked more than\nanyone else. I respect the hell out of what he has done. It just could not\nwork without Elon. In my view, he has earned the right to be the front\nperson for this thing.\u201d\nThe rank-and-file employees tend to describe Musk in more mixed\nways. They revere his drive and respect how demanding he can be. They\nalso think he can be hard to the point of mean and come off as capricious.\nThe employees want to be close to Musk, but they also fear that he\u2019ll\nsuddenly change his mind about something and that every interaction with\nhim is an opportunity to be fired. \u201cElon\u2019s worst trait by far, in my opinion,\nis a complete lack of loyalty or human connection,\u201d said one former\nemployee. \u201cMany of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed\nto the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was\ncalculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared; maybe\nhe was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree.\nWhat was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition:\nused for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.\u201d\nThe communications departments of SpaceX and Tesla have witnessed\nthe latter forms of behavior more than any other group of employees. Musk\nhas burned through public relations staffers with comical efficiency. He\ntends to take on a lot of the communications work himself, writing news\nreleases and contacting the press as he sees fit. Quite often, Musk does not\nlet his communications staff in on his agenda. Ahead of the Hyperloop\nannouncement, for example, his representatives were sending me e-mails to\nfind out the time and date for the press conference. On other occasions,\nreporters have received an alert about a teleconference with Musk just\nminutes before it started. This was not a function of the PR people being\nincompetent in getting word of the event out. The truth was that Musk had\nonly let them know about his plans a couple of minutes in advance, and\nthey were scrambling to catch up to his whims. When Musk does delegate\nwork to the communications staff, they\u2019re expected to jump in without\nmissing a beat and to execute at the highest level. Some of this staff,\noperating under this mix of pressure and surprise, only lasted between a few\nweeks and a few months. A few others have hung on for a couple of years\nbefore burning out or being fired.", "The granddaddy example of Musk\u2019s seemingly callous interoffice style\noccurred in early 2014 when he fired Mary Beth Brown. To describe her as\na loyal executive assistant would be grossly inadequate. Brown often felt\nlike an extension of Musk\u2014the one being who crossed over into all of his\nworlds. For more than a decade, she gave up her life for Musk, traipsing\nback and forth between Los Angeles and Silicon Valley every week, while\nworking late into the night and on weekends. Brown went to Musk and\nasked that she be compensated on par with SpaceX\u2019s top executives, since\nshe was handling so much of Musk\u2019s scheduling across two companies,\ndoing public relations work and often making business decisions. Musk\nreplied that Brown should take a couple of weeks off, and he would take on\nher duties and gauge how hard they were. When Brown returned, Musk let\nher know that he didn\u2019t need her anymore, and he asked Shotwell\u2019s assistant\nto begin scheduling his meetings. Brown, still loyal and hurt, didn\u2019t want to\ndiscuss any of this with me. Musk said that she had become too comfortable\nspeaking on his behalf and that, frankly, she needed a life. Other people\ngrumbled that Brown and Riley clashed and that this was the root cause of\nBrown\u2019s ouster.* (Brown declined to be interviewed for this book, despite\nseveral requests.)\nWhatever the case, the optics of the situation were terrible. Tony Stark\ndoesn\u2019t fire Pepper Potts. He adores her and takes care of her for life. She\u2019s\nthe only person he can really trust\u2014the one who has been there through\neverything. That Musk was willing to let Brown go and in such an\nunceremonious fashion struck people inside SpaceX and Tesla as\nscandalous and as the ultimate confirmation of his cruel stoicism. The tale\nof Brown\u2019s departure became part of the lore around Musk\u2019s lack of\nempathy. It got bundled up into the stories of Musk dressing employees\ndown in legendary fashion with vicious barb after vicious barb. People also\nlinked this type of behavior to Musk\u2019s other quirky traits. He\u2019s been known\nto obsess over typos in e-mails to the point that he could not see past the\nerrors and read the actual content of the messages. Even in social settings,\nMusk might get up from the dinner table without a word of explanation to\nhead outside and look at the stars, simply because he\u2019s not willing to suffer\nfools or small talk. After adding up this behavior, dozens of people\nexpressed to me their conclusion that Musk sits somewhere on the autism\nspectrum and that he has trouble considering other people\u2019s emotions and\ncaring about their well-being.", "There\u2019s a tendency, especially in Silicon Valley, to label people who are\na bit different or quirky as autistic or afflicted with Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\nIt\u2019s armchair psychology for conditions that can be inherently funky to\ndiagnose or even codify. To slap this label on Musk feels ill-informed and\ntoo easy.\nMusk acts differently with his closest friends and family than he does\nwith employees, even those who have worked alongside him for a long\ntime. Among his inner circle, Musk is warm, funny, and deeply emotional.*\nHe might not engage in the standard chitchat, asking a friend how his kids\nare doing, but he would do everything in his considerable power to help that\nfriend if his child were sick or in trouble. He will protect those close to him\nat all costs and, when deemed necessary, seek to destroy those who have\nwronged him or his friends.\nMusk\u2019s behavior matches up much more closely with someone who is\ndescribed by neuropsychologists as profoundly gifted. These are people\nwho in childhood exhibit exceptional intellectual depth and max out IQ\ntests. It\u2019s not uncommon for these children to look out into the world and\nfind flaws\u2014glitches in the system\u2014and construct logical paths in their\nminds to fix them. For Musk, the call to ensure that mankind is a\nmultiplanetary species partly stems from a life richly influenced by science\nfiction and technology. Equally it\u2019s a moral imperative that dates back to his\nchildhood. In some form, this has forever been his mandate.\nEach facet of Musk\u2019s life might be an attempt to soothe a type of\nexistential depression that seems to gnaw at his every fiber. He sees man as\nself-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who\nsuggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in\nthe way of all of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as\npeople. It\u2019s more that he feels pained by their mistakes, which have\nconsigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is a\nsymptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he\u2019s the only one who really\ngrasps the urgency of his mission. He\u2019s less sensitive and less tolerant than\nother people because the stakes are so high. Employees need to help solve\nthe problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out of\nthe way.\nMusk has been pretty up front about these tendencies. He\u2019s implored\npeople to understand that he\u2019s not chasing momentary opportunities in the\nbusiness world. He\u2019s trying to solve problems that have been consuming", "him for decades. During our conversations, Musk went back to this very\npoint over and over again, making sure to emphasize just how long he\u2019d\nthought about electric cars and space. The same patterns are visible in his\nactions as well. When Musk announced in 2014 that Tesla would open-\nsource all of its patents, analysts tried to decide whether this was a publicity\nstunt or if it hid an ulterior motive or a catch. But the decision was a\nstraightforward one for Musk. He wants people to make and buy electric\ncars. Man\u2019s future, as he sees it, depends on this. If open-sourcing Tesla\u2019s\npatents means other companies can build electric cars more easily, then that\nis good for mankind, and the ideas should be free. The cynic will scoff at\nthis, and understandably so. Musk, however, has been programmed to\nbehave this way and tends to be sincere when explaining his thinking\u2014\nalmost to a fault.\nThe people who get closest to Musk are the ones who learn to relate to\nthis mode of thinking.22 They\u2019re the ones who can identify with his vision\nyet challenge him intellectually to complete it. When he asked me during\none of our dinners if I thought he was insane, it was a test of sorts. We had\ntalked enough that he knew I was interested in what he was doing. He had\nstarted to trust me and open up but wanted to make sure\u2014one final time\u2014\nthat I truly grasped the importance of his quest. Many of his closest friends\nhave passed much grander, more demanding tests. They\u2019ve invested in his\ncompanies. They\u2019ve defended him against critics. They helped him keep the\nwolves at bay during 2008. They\u2019ve proven their loyalty and their\ncommitment to his cause.\nPeople in the technology industry have tended to liken Musk\u2019s drive and\nthe scope of his ambition to that of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. \u201cElon has that\ndeep appreciation for technology, the no-holds-barred attitude of a\nvisionary, and that determination to go after long-term things that they both\nhad,\u201d said Edward Jung, a child prodigy who worked for Jobs and Gates\nand ended up as Microsoft\u2019s chief software architect. \u201cAnd he has that\nconsumer sensibility of Steve along with the ability to hire good people\noutside of his own comfort areas that\u2019s more like Bill. You almost wish that\nBill and Steve had a genetically engineered love child and, who knows,\nmaybe we should genotype Elon to see if that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Steve\nJurvetson, the venture capitalist who has invested in SpaceX, Tesla, and\nSolarCity, worked for Jobs, and knows Gates well, also described Musk as\nan upgraded mix of the two. \u201cLike Jobs, Elon does not tolerate C or D", "players,\u201d said Jurvetson. \u201cBut I\u2019d say he\u2019s nicer than Jobs and a bit more\nrefined than Bill Gates.\u201d*\nBut the more you know about Musk, the harder it becomes to place him\namong his peers. Jobs is another CEO who ran two, large industry-changing\ncompanies\u2014Apple and Pixar. But that\u2019s where the practical similarities\nbetween the two men end. Jobs dedicated far more of his energy to Apple\nthan Pixar, unlike Musk, who has poured equal energy into both companies,\nwhile saving whatever was left over for SolarCity. Jobs was also legendary\nfor his attention to detail. No one, however, would suggest that his reach\nextended down as far as Musk\u2019s into overseeing so much of the companies\u2019\nday-to-day operations. Musk\u2019s approach has its limitations. He\u2019s less artful\nwith marketing and media strategy. Musk does not rehearse his\npresentations or polish speeches. He wings most of the announcements\nfrom Tesla and SpaceX. He\u2019ll also fire off some major bit of news on a\nFriday afternoon when it\u2019s likely to get lost as reporters head home for the\nweekend, simply because that\u2019s when he finished writing the press release\nor wanted to move on to something else. Jobs, by contrast, treated every\npresentation and media moment as precious. Musk simply does not have the\nluxury to work that way. \u201cI don\u2019t have days to practice,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got\nto give impromptu talks, and the results may vary.\u201d\nAs for whether Musk is leading the technology industry to new heights\nlike Gates and Jobs, the professional pundits remain mixed. One camp\nholds that SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX offer little in the way of real hope\nfor an industry that could use some blockbuster innovations. For the other\ncamp, Musk is the real deal and the brightest shining star of what they see\nas a coming revolution in technology.\nThe economist Tyler Cowen\u2014who has earned some measure of fame in\nrecent years for his insightful writings about the state of the technology\nindustry and his ideas on where it may go\u2014falls into that first camp. In The\nGreat Stagnation, Cowen bemoaned the lack of big technological advances\nand argued that the American economy has slowed and wages have been\ndepressed as a result. \u201cIn a figurative sense, the American economy has\nenjoyed lots of low-hanging fruit since at least the seventeenth century,\nwhether it be free land, lots of immigrant labor, or powerful new\ntechnologies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet during the last forty years, that low-hanging\nfruit started disappearing, and we started pretending it was still there. We\nhave failed to recognize that we are at a technological plateau and the trees", "are more bare than we would like to think. That\u2019s it. That is what has gone\nwrong.\u201d\nIn his next book, Average Is Over, Cowen predicted an unromantic\nfuture in which a great divide had occurred between the Haves and the\nHave Nots. In Cowen\u2019s future, huge gains in artificial intelligence will lead\nto the elimination of many of today\u2019s high-employment lines of work. The\npeople who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to\ncomplement the machines and team effectively with them. As for the\nunemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find jobs going to\nwork for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and\ngardeners. If anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind\ntoward a rosier future, Cowen can\u2019t find it. Coming up with true\nbreakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to\nCowen, because we\u2019ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries.\nDuring a lunch in Virginia, Cowen described Musk not as a genius inventor\nbut as an attention seeker, and not a terribly good one at that. \u201cI don\u2019t think\na lot of people care about getting to Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it seems like a\nvery expensive way to drive whatever breakthroughs you might get from it.\nThen, you hear about the Hyperloop. I don\u2019t think he has any intention of\ndoing it. You have to wonder if it\u2019s not meant just to be publicity for his\ncompanies. As for Tesla, it might work. But you\u2019re still just pushing the\nproblems back somewhere else. You still have to generate power. It could\nbe that he is challenging convention less than people think.\u201d\nThese sentiments are not far off from those of Vaclav Smil, a professor\nemeritus at the University of Manitoba. Bill Gates has hailed Smil as an\nimportant writer for his tomes on energy, the environment, and\nmanufacturing. One of Smil\u2019s latest works is Made in the USA, an\nexploration of America\u2019s past manufacturing glories and its subsequent,\ndismal loss of industry. Anyone who thinks the United States is making a\nnatural, clever shift away from manufacturing and toward higher-paying\ninformation-worker jobs will want to read this book and have a gander at\nthe long-term consequences of this change. Smil presents numerous\nexamples of the ways in which the manufacturing industry generates major\ninnovations and creates a massive ecosystem of jobs and technical smarts\naround them. \u201cFor example, when some three decades ago the United States\nstopped making virtually all \u2018commodity\u2019 consumer electronic devices and\ndisplays, it also lost its capacity to develop and mass-produce advanced flat", "screens and batteries, two classes of products that are quintessential for\nportable computers and cell phones and whose large-scale imports keep\nadding to the US trade deficit,\u201d Smil wrote. A bit later in the book, Smil\nemphasized that the aerospace industry, in particular, has been a huge boon\nto the U.S. economy and one of its major exporters. \u201cMaintaining the\nsector\u2019s competitiveness must be a key component of efforts to boost US\nexports, and the exports will have to be a large part of the sector\u2019s sales\nbecause the world\u2019s largest aerospace market of the next two decades will\nbe in Asia, above all in China and India, and American aircraft and\naeroengine makers should benefit from this expansion.\u201d\nSmil is consumed by the United States\u2019 waning ability to compete with\nChina and yet does not perceive Musk or his companies as any sort of\ncounter to this slide. \u201cAs, among other things, a historian of technical\nadvances I simply must see Tesla as nothing but an utterly derivative\noverhyped toy for showoffs,\u201d Smil wrote to me. \u201cThe last thing a country\nwith 50 million people on food stamps and 85 billion dollars deeper into\ndebt every month needs is anything to do with space, especially space with\nmore joyrides for the super rich. And the loop proposal was nothing but\nbamboozling people who do not know anything about kindergarten physics\nwith a very old, long publicized Gedankenexperiment in kinetics. . . . There\nare many inventive Americans, but in that lineup Musk would be trailing far\nbehind.\u201d\nThe comments were blunt and surprising given some of the things Smil\ncelebrated in his recent book. He spent a good deal of time showing the\npositive impact that Henry Ford\u2019s vertical integration had on advancing the\ncar industry and the American economy. He also wrote at length about the\nrise of \u201cmechatronic machines,\u201d or machines that rely on a lot of electronics\nand software. \u201cBy 2010 the electronic controls for a typical sedan required\nmore lines of software code than the instructions needed to operate the\nlatest Boeing jetliner,\u201d Smil wrote. \u201cAmerican manufacturing has turned\nmodern cars into remarkable mechatronic machines. The first decade of the\ntwenty-first century also brought innovations ranging from the deployment\nof new materials (carbon composites in aviation, nanostructures) to wireless\nelectronics.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a tendency among critics to dismiss Musk as a frivolous\ndreamer that stems first and foremost from a misunderstanding of what\nMusk is actually doing. People like Smil seem to catch an article or", "television show that hits on Musk\u2019s quest to get to Mars and immediately\nlump him with the space tourism crowd. Musk, though, hardly ever talks\nabout tourism and has, since day one, built up SpaceX to compete at the\nindustrial end of the space business. If Smil thinks Boeing selling planes is\ncrucial to the American economy, then he should be enthused about what\nSpaceX has managed to accomplish in the commercial launch market.\nSpaceX builds its products in the United States, has made dramatic\nadvances in aerospace technology, and has made similar advances in\nmaterials and manufacturing techniques. It would not take much to argue\nthat SpaceX is America\u2019s only hope of competing against China in the next\ncouple of decades. As for mechatronic machines, SpaceX and Tesla have set\nthe example of fusing together electronics, software, and metal that their\nrivals are now struggling to match. And all of Musk\u2019s companies, including\nSolarCity, have made dramatic use of vertical integration and turned in-\nhouse control of components into a real advantage.\nTo get a sense of how powerful Musk\u2019s work may end up being for the\nAmerican economy, have a think about the dominant mechatronic machine\nof the past several years: the smartphone. Pre-iPhone, the United States was\nthe laggard in the telecommunications industry. All of the exciting cell\nphones and mobile services were in Europe and Asia, while American\nconsumers bumbled along with dated equipment. When the iPhone arrived\nin 2007, it changed everything. Apple\u2019s device mimicked many of the\nfunctions of a computer and then added new abilities with its apps, sensors,\nand location awareness. Google charged to market with its Android\nsoftware and related handsets, and the United States suddenly emerged as\nthe driving force in the mobile industry. Smartphones were revolutionary\nbecause of the ways they allowed hardware, software, and services to work\nin unison. This was a mix that favored the skills of Silicon Valley. The rise\nof the smartphone led to a massive industrial boom in which Apple became\nthe most valuable company in the country, and billions of its clever devices\nwere spread all over the world.\nTony Fadell, the former Apple executive credited with bringing the iPod\nand iPhone to market, has characterized the smartphone as representative of\na type of super-cycle in which hardware and software have reached a\ncritical point of maturity. Electronics are good and cheap, while software is\nmore reliable and sophisticated. Their interplay is now resulting in science\nfiction\u2013worthy ideas we were promised long ago becoming a reality.", "Google has its self-driving cars and has acquired dozens of robotics\ncompanies as it looks to merge code and machine. Fadell\u2019s company Nest\nhas its intelligent thermostats and smoke alarms. General Electric has jet\nengines packed full of sensors taught to proactively report possible\nanomalies to its human mechanics. And a host of start-ups have begun\ninfusing medical devices with powerful software to help people monitor and\nanalyze their bodies and diagnose conditions. Tiny satellites are being put\ninto orbit twenty at a time, and instead of being given a fixed task for their\nentire lifetimes, like their predecessors, they\u2019re being reprogrammed on the\nfly for a wide variety of business and scientific tasks. Zee Aero, a start-up in\nMountain View, has a couple of former SpaceX staffers on hand and is\nworking on a secretive new type of transport. A flying car at last? Perhaps.\nFor Fadell, Musk\u2019s work sits at the highest end of this trend. \u201cHe could\nhave just made an electric car,\u201d Fadell said. \u201cBut he did things like use\nmotors to actuate the door handles. He\u2019s bringing the consumer electronics\nand the software together, and the other car companies are trying to figure\nout a way to get there. Whether it\u2019s Tesla or SpaceX taking Ethernet cables\nand running them inside of rocket ships, you are talking about combining\nthe old-world science of manufacturing with low-cost, consumer-grade\ntechnology. You put these things together, and they morph into something\nwe have never seen before. All of a sudden there is a wholesale change,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s a step function.\u201d\nTo the extent that Silicon Valley has searched for an inheritor to Steve\nJobs\u2019s role as the dominant, guiding force of the technology industry, Musk\nhas emerged as the most likely candidate. He\u2019s certainly the \u201cit\u201d guy of the\nmoment. Start-up founders, proven executives, and legends hold him up as\nthe person they most admire. The more mainstream Tesla can become, the\nmore Musk\u2019s reputation will rise. A hot-selling Model 3 would certify Musk\nas that rare being able to rethink an industry, read consumers, and execute.\nFrom there, his more fanciful ideas start to seem inevitable. \u201cElon is one of\nthe few people that I feel is more accomplished than I am,\u201d said Craig\nVenter, the man who decoded the human genome and went on to create\nsynthetic lifeforms. At some point he hopes to work with Musk on a type of\nDNA printer that could be sent to Mars. It would, in theory, allow humans\nto create medicines, food, and helpful microbes for early settlers of the\nplanet. \u201cI think biological teleportation is what is going to truly enable the", "colonization of space,\u201d he said. \u201cElon and I have been talking about how\nthis might play out.\u201d\nOne of Musk\u2019s most ardent admirers is also one of his best friends:\nLarry Page, the cofounder and CEO of Google. Page has ended up on\nMusk\u2019s house-surfing schedule. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of homeless, which I think is\nsort of funny,\u201d Page said. \u201cHe\u2019ll e-mail and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know where to stay\ntonight. Can I come over?\u2019 I haven\u2019t given him a key or anything yet.\u201d\nGoogle has invested more than just about any other technology\ncompany into Musk\u2019s sort of moon-shot projects: self-driving cars, robots,\nand even a cash prize to get a machine onto the moon cheaply. The\ncompany, however, operates under a set of constraints and expectations that\ncome with employing tens of thousands of people and being analyzed\nconstantly by investors. It\u2019s with this in mind that Page sometimes feels a\nbit envious of Musk, who has managed to make radical ideas the basis of\nhis companies. \u201cIf you think about Silicon Valley or corporate leaders in\ngeneral, they\u2019re not usually lacking in money,\u201d Page said. \u201cIf you have all\nthis money, which presumably you\u2019re going to give away and couldn\u2019t even\nspend it all if you wanted to, why then are you devoting your time to a\ncompany that\u2019s not really doing anything good? That\u2019s why I find Elon to\nbe an inspiring example. He said, \u2018Well, what should I really do in this\nworld? Solve cars, global warming, and make humans multiplanetary.\u2019 I\nmean those are pretty compelling goals, and now he has businesses to do\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cThis becomes a competitive advantage for him, too. Why would you\nwant to work for a defense contractor when you can work for a guy who\nwants to go to Mars and he\u2019s going to move heaven and earth to make it\nhappen? You can frame a problem in a way that\u2019s really good for the\nbusiness.\u201d\nAt one point, a quotation from Page made the rounds, saying that he\nwanted to leave all of his money to Musk. Page felt he was misquoted but\nstood by the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving my money to him at the moment,\u201d\nPage said. \u201cBut Elon makes a pretty compelling case for having a\nmultiplanetary society just because, you know, otherwise we might all die,\nwhich seems like it would be sad for all sorts of different reasons. I think\nit\u2019s a very doable project, and it\u2019s a relatively modest resource that we need\nto set up a permanent human settlement on Mars. I was just trying to make\nthe point that that\u2019s a really powerful idea.\u201d", "As Page puts it, \u201cGood ideas are always crazy until they\u2019re not.\u201d It\u2019s a\nprinciple he\u2019s tried to apply at Google. When Page and Sergey Brin began\nwondering aloud about developing ways to search the text inside of books,\nall of the experts they consulted said it would be impossible to digitize\nevery book. The Google cofounders decided to run the numbers and see if it\nwas actually physically possible to scan the books in a reasonable amount\nof time. They concluded it was, and Google has since scanned millions of\nbooks. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that your intuition about things you don\u2019t know that\nmuch about isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe way Elon talks about this is\nthat you always need to start with the first principles of a problem. What are\nthe physics of it? How much time will it take? How much will it cost? How\nmuch cheaper can I make it? There\u2019s this level of engineering and physics\nthat you need to make judgments about what\u2019s possible and interesting.\nElon is unusual in that he knows that, and he also knows business and\norganization and leadership and governmental issues.\u201d\nSome of the conversations between Musk and Page take place at a\nsecret apartment Google owns in downtown Palo Alto. It\u2019s inside of one of\nthe taller buildings in the area and offers views of the mountains\nsurrounding the Stanford University campus. Page and Brin will take\nprivate meetings at the apartment and have their own chef on call to prepare\nfood for guests. When Musk is present, the chats tend toward the absurd\nand fantastic. \u201cI was there once, and Elon was talking about building an\nelectric jet plane that can take off and land vertically,\u201d said George Zachary,\nthe venture capitalist and friend of Musk\u2019s. \u201cLarry said the plane should be\nable to land on ski slopes, and Sergey said it needed to be able to dock at a\nport in Manhattan. Then they started talking about building a commuter\nplane that was always circling the Earth, and you\u2019d hop up to it and get\nplaces incredibly fast. I thought everyone was kidding, but at the end I\nasked Elon, \u2018Are you really going to do that?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of our recreation, I guess,\u201d said Page.23 \u201cIt\u2019s fun for the three\nof us to talk about kind of crazy things, and we find stuff that eventually\nturns out to be real. We go through hundreds or thousands of possible things\nbefore arriving at the ones that are most promising.\u201d\nPage talked about Musk at times as if he were a one-of-a-kind, a force\nof nature able to accomplish things in the business world that others would\nnever even try. \u201cWe think of SpaceX and Tesla as being these tremendously\nrisky things, but I think Elon was going to make them work no matter what.", "He\u2019s willing to suffer some personal cost, and I think that makes his odds\nactually pretty good. If you knew him personally, you would look back to\nwhen he started the companies and say his odds of success would be more\nthan ninety percent. I mean we just have a single proof point now that you\ncan be really passionate about something that other people think is crazy\nand you can really succeed. And you look at it with Elon and you say,\n\u2018Well, maybe it\u2019s not luck. He\u2019s done it twice. It can\u2019t be luck totally.\u2019 I\nthink that means it should be repeatable in some sense. At least it\u2019s\nrepeatable by him. Maybe we should get him to do more things.\u201d\nPage holds Musk up as a model he wishes others would emulate\u2014a\nfigure that should be replicated during a time in which the businessmen and\npoliticians have fixated on short-term, inconsequential goals. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019re doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really\nimportant to do,\u201d Page said. \u201cI think like we\u2019re just not educating people in\nthis kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and\nscientific background. You should have some leadership training and a bit\nof MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and\nraise money. I don\u2019t think most people are doing that, and it\u2019s a big\nproblem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you\u2019re\nable to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think\ndifferently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work.\nI think that\u2019s really an important thing for the world. That\u2019s how we make\nprogress.\u201d\nThe pressure of feeling the need to fix the world takes its toll on Musk\u2019s\nbody. There are times when you run into Musk and he looks utterly\nexhausted. He does not have bags under his eyes but rather deep, shadowy\nvalleys. During the worst of times, following weeks of sleep deprivation,\nhis eyes seem to have sunk back into his skull. Musk\u2019s weight moves up\nand down with the stress, and he\u2019s usually heavier when really overworked.\nIt\u2019s funny in a way that Musk spends so much time talking about man\u2019s\nsurvival but isn\u2019t willing to address the consequences of what his lifestyle\ndoes to his body. \u201cElon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is\nshort,\u201d Straubel said. \u201cIf you really embrace this, it leaves you with the\nobvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as you can.\u201d\nSuffering, though, has always been Musk\u2019s thing. The kids at school\ntortured him. His father played brutal mind games. Musk then abused\nhimself by working inhumane hours and forever pushing his businesses to", "the edge. The idea of work-life balance seems meaningless in this context.\nFor Musk, it\u2019s just life, and his wife and kids try to fit into the show where\nthey can. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty good dad,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI have the kids for slightly\nmore than half the week and spend a fair bit of time with them. I also take\nthem with me when I go out of town. Recently, we went to the Monaco\nGrand Prix and were hanging out with the prince and princess of Monaco. It\nall seemed quite normal to the kids, and they were blas\u00e9 about it. They are\ngrowing up having a set of experiences that are extremely unusual, but you\ndon\u2019t realize experiences are unusual until you are much older. They\u2019re just\nyour experiences. They have good manners at meals.\u201d\nIt bothers Musk a bit that his kids won\u2019t suffer like he did. He feels that\nthe suffering helped to make him who he is and gave him extra reserves of\nstrength and will. \u201cThey might have a little adversity at school, but these\ndays schools are so protective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you call someone a name, you\nget sent home. When I was going to school, if they punched you and there\nwas no blood, it was like, \u2018Whatever. Shake it off.\u2019 Even if there was a little\nblood, but not a lot, it was fine. What do I do? Create artificial adversity?\nHow do you do that? The biggest battle I have is restricting their video\ngame time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to\nread more than they play video games. They also can\u2019t play completely\nstupid video games. There\u2019s one game they downloaded recently called\nCookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It\u2019s like a Psych\n101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play\nFlappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy Bird, but at least there is some\nphysics involved.\u201d\nMusk has talked about having more kids, and it\u2019s on this subject that he\ndelivers some controversial philosophizing vis-\u00e0-vis the creator of Beavis\nand Butt-head. \u201cThere\u2019s this point that Mike Judge makes in Idiocracy,\nwhich is like smart people, you know, should at least sustain their\nnumbers,\u201d Musk said. \u201cLike, if it\u2019s a negative Darwinian vector, then\nobviously that\u2019s not a good thing. It should be at least neutral. But if each\nsuccessive generation of smart people has fewer kids, that\u2019s probably bad,\ntoo. I mean, Europe, Japan, Russia, China are all headed for demographic\nimplosion. And the fact of the matter is that basically the wealthier\u2014\nbasically wealth, education, and being secular are all indicative of low birth\nrate. They all correlate with low birth rate. I\u2019m not saying like only smart\npeople should have kids. I\u2019m just saying that smart people should have kids", "as well. They should at least maintain\u2014at least be a replacement rate. And\nthe fact of the matter is that I notice that a lot of really smart women have\nzero or one kid. You\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s probably not good.\u2019\u201d\nThe next decade of Musk Co. should be quite something. Musk has\ngiven himself a chance to become one of the greatest businessmen and\ninnovators of all time. By 2025 Tesla could very well have a lineup of five\nor six cars and be the dominant force in a booming electric car market.\nPlaying off its current growth rate, SolarCity will have had time to emerge\nas a massive utility company and the leader in a solar market that had\nfinally lived up to its promise. SpaceX? Well, it\u2019s perhaps the most\nintriguing. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, SpaceX should be conducting\nweekly flights to space, carrying humans and cargo, and have put most of\nits competitors out of business. Its rockets should be capable of doing a\ncouple of laps around the moon and then landing with pinpoint accuracy\nback at the spaceport in Texas. And the preparation for the first few dozen\ntrips to Mars should be well under way.\nIf all of this were taking place, Musk, then in his mid-fifties, likely\nwould be the richest man in the world and among its most powerful. He\nwould be the majority shareholder in three public companies, and history\nwould be preparing to smile broadly on what he had accomplished. During\na time in which countries and other businesses were paralyzed by indecision\nand inaction, Musk would have mounted the most viable charge against\nglobal warming, while also providing people with an escape plan\u2014just in\ncase. He would have brought a substantial amount of crucial manufacturing\nback to the United States while also providing an example for other\nentrepreneurs hoping to harness a new age of wonderful machines. As Thiel\nsaid, Musk may well have gone so far as to give people hope and to have\nrenewed their faith in what technology can do for mankind.\nThis future, of course, remains precarious. Huge technological issues\nconfront all three of Musk\u2019s companies. He\u2019s bet on the inventiveness of\nman and the ability of solar, battery, and aerospace technology to follow\npredicted price and performance curves. Even if these bets hit as he hopes,\nTesla could face a weird, unexpected recall. SpaceX could have a rocket\ncarrying humans blow up\u2014an incident that could very well end the\ncompany on the spot. Dramatic risks accompany just about everything\nMusk does.", "By the time our last dinner had come around, I had decided that this\npropensity for risk had little to do with Musk being insane, as he had\nwondered aloud several months earlier. No, Musk just seems to possess a\nlevel of conviction that is so intense and exceptional as to be off-putting to\nsome. As we shared some chips and guacamole and cocktails, I asked Musk\ndirectly just how much he was willing to put on the line. His response?\nEverything that other people hold dear. \u201cI would like to die on Mars,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cJust not on impact. Ideally I\u2019d like to go for a visit, come back for a\nwhile, and then go there when I\u2019m like seventy or something and then just\nstay there. If things turn out well, that would be the case. If my wife and I\nhave a bunch of kids, she would probably stay with them on Earth.\u201d", "EPILOGUE\nE\nLON MUSK IS A BODY THAT REMAINS VERY MUCH IN\nMOTION.\nBy the time this book reaches your hands, it\u2019s quite possible that Musk\nand SpaceX will have managed to land a rocket on a barge at sea or back on\na launchpad in Florida. Tesla Motors may have unveiled some of the special\nfeatures of the Model X. Musk could have formally declared war on the\nartificial intelligence machines coming to life inside of Google\u2019s data\ncenters. Who knows?\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Musk\u2019s desire to take on more keeps growing. Just\nas I was putting the finishing touches on this book, Musk unfurled a number\nof major initiatives. The most dramatic of which is a plan to surround the\nEarth with thousands of small communications satellites. Musk wants, in\neffect, to build a space-based Internet in which the satellites would be close\nenough to the planet to beam down bandwidth at high speeds. Such a\nsystem would be useful for a couple of reasons: In areas too poor or too\nremote to have fiber-optic connections, it would provide people with high-\nspeed Internet for the first time. It could also function as an efficient\nbackhaul network for businesses and consumers.\nMusk, of course, also sees this space Internet as key to his long-term\nambitions around Mars. \u201cIt will be important for Mars to have a global\ncommunications network,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this needs to be done, and I\ndon\u2019t see anyone else doing it.\u201d SpaceX will build these satellites at a new\nfactory and will also look to sell more satellites to commercial customers as\nit perfects the technology. To fund part of this unbelievably ambitious\nproject, SpaceX secured $1 billion from Google and Fidelity. In a rare\nmoment of restraint, Musk declined to provide an exact delivery date for his\nspace Internet, which he forecasts will cost more than $10 billion to build.", "\u201cPeople should not expect this to be active sooner than five years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut we see it as a long-term revenue source for SpaceX to be able to fund\na city on Mars.\u201d\nMeanwhile, SolarCity has purchased a new research and development\nfacility near the Tesla factory in Silicon Valley that\u2019s intended to aid its\nmanufacturing work. The building it acquired was the old Solyndra\nmanufacturing plant\u2014another symbol of Musk\u2019s ability to thrive in the\ngreen technology industry that has destroyed so many other entrepreneurs.\nAnd Tesla continues to build its Gigafactory in Nevada at pace, while its\nnetwork of charging stations has saved upward of four million gallons of\ngas. During a quarterly earnings announcement, J. B. Straubel promised that\nTesla would start producing battery systems for home use in 2015 that\nwould let people hop off the grid for periods of time. Musk then one-upped\nStraubel, bragging that he thinks Tesla could eventually be more valuable\nthan Apple and could challenge it in the race to be the first $1 trillion\ncompany. A handful of groups have also set to work building prototype\nHyperloop systems in and around California. Oh, and Musk starred in an\nepisode of The Simpsons titled \u201cThe Musk Who Fell to Earth,\u201d in which\nHomer became his inventive muse.\nThe heady expansion plans and triumphant rhetoric from Musk were\nstill not quite enough to hide all of Musk Co.\u2019s flaws. Early 2015 marked\nthe vociferous return of Musk\u2019s detractors on Wall Street. Tesla\u2019s sales in\nChina were lackluster by any measure, and some analysts renewed their\ndoubts about how much long-term demand there would be for the Model S.\nTesla\u2019s shares slumped and, for the first time in a while, Musk sounded\nflustered trying to defend the company\u2019s position.\nThe personal costs of Musk\u2019s lifestyle were more severe. Musk\nannounced that, once again, he would be divorcing Talulah Riley.\nAccording to Musk, Riley wanted a simpler, smaller life in England and had\ncome to despise Los Angeles. \u201cTried to talk her out of it, but she insisted,\u201d\nMusk told me. \u201cIt is possible that she will change her mind at some point,\nbut not anytime soon.\u201d\nAfter finishing my reporting and writing for this book, I had a chance to\nspeak with some of Musk\u2019s confidantes and employees in a more relaxed\nmanner and bounce various ideas off of them. I\u2019m more convinced than\never that Musk is, and has always been, a man on a quest, and that his brand\nof quest is far more fantastic and consuming than anything most of us will", "ever experience. It seems that he\u2019s become almost addicted to expanding his\nambitions and can\u2019t quite stop himself from announcing things like the\nHyperloop and the space Internet. I\u2019m also more convinced than ever that\nMusk is a deeply emotional person who suffers and rejoices in an epic\nfashion. This side of him is likely obscured by the fact that he feels most\ndeeply about his own humanity-altering quest and so has trouble\nrecognizing the strong emotions of those around him. This tends to make\nMusk come off as aloof and hard. I would argue, however, that his brand of\nempathy is unique. He seems to feel for the human species as a whole\nwithout always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals. And\nit may well be the case that this is exactly the type of person it takes to\nmake a freaking space Internet real.", "APPENDIX 1\nT\nHE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY LOVES MESSY FOUNDING\nTALES. A bit of backstabbing? A hearty helping of deceit? Perfect. And\nyet, the press has never really dug into the alleged intrigue surrounding\nMusk\u2019s formation of Zip2, nor have reporters examined the very serious\nallegations of inconsistencies in Musk\u2019s academic record.\nIn April 2007, a physicist named John O\u2019Reilly filed a lawsuit alleging\nthat Musk had stolen the idea for Zip2. According to the lawsuit, filed with\nthe Superior Court of California in Santa Clara, O\u2019Reilly first met Musk in\nOctober 1995. O\u2019Reilly had started a company called Internet Merchant\nChannel, or IMC, which planned to let businesses create primitive,\ninformation-packed online ads. A restaurant, for example, could build an ad\nthat would display its menu and perhaps even turn-by-turn directions to its\nlocation. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ideas were mostly theoretical, but Zip2 did end up\nproviding a very similar service. O\u2019Reilly alleged that Musk had first heard\nabout this type of technology while trying to get a job working as a\nsalesman for IMC. He and Musk met on at least three occasions, according\nto the lawsuit, to talk about the job. O\u2019Reilly then went on an overseas trip\nand struggled to get back in touch with Musk upon his return.\nO\u2019Reilly declined to discuss his case against Musk with me. But in the\nlawsuit, he claimed to have learned about Zip2 through happenstance many\nyears after meeting Musk. While reading a book in 2005 about the Internet\neconomy, O\u2019Reilly stumbled upon a passage that mentioned Musk\u2019s\nfounding of Zip2 and its 1999 sale to Compaq Computer for $307 million in\ncash. The physicist was blown away as he realized that Zip2 sounded a lot\nlike IMC, which had never amounted to much of a business. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s\nmind raced back to his encounters with Musk. He began to suspect that\nMusk had avoided him on purpose and that instead of becoming an IMC", "salesman, Musk had run off to pursue the same concept on his own.\nO\u2019Reilly wanted to be compensated for coming up with the original\nbusiness idea. He spent about two years making his case against Musk. The\ncase file at the court runs hundreds of pages. O\u2019Reilly has affidavits from\npeople that back up parts of his version of events. A judge, however, found\nthat O\u2019Reilly lacked the necessary legal standing to bring this case against\nMusk due to issues around how his businesses had been dissolved. The\njudge ordered O\u2019Reilly to shell out $125,000 for Musk\u2019s legal fees in 2010.\nAll these years later, Musk still hasn\u2019t made O\u2019Reilly pay.\nWhile playing detective, O\u2019Reilly unearthed some information about\nMusk\u2019s past that\u2019s arguably more interesting than the allegations in the\nlawsuit. He found that the University of Pennsylvania granted Musk\u2019s\ndegrees in 1997\u2014two years later than what Musk has cited. I called Penn\u2019s\nregistrar and verified these findings. Copies of Musk\u2019s records show that he\nreceived a dual degree in economics and physics in May 1997. O\u2019Reilly\nalso subpoenaed the registrar\u2019s office at Stanford to verify Musk\u2019s\nadmittance in 1995 for his doctorate work in physics. \u201cBased on the\ninformation you provided, we are unable to locate a record in our office for\nElon Musk,\u201d wrote the director of graduate admissions. When asked during\nthe case to produce a document verifying Musk\u2019s enrollment at Stanford,\nMusk\u2019s attorney declined and called the request \u201cunduly burdensome.\u201d I\ncontacted a number of Stanford physics professors who taught in 1995, and\nthey either failed to respond or didn\u2019t remember Musk. Doug Osheroff, a\nNobel Prize winner and department chair at the time, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\nknew Elon, and am pretty sure that he was not in the Physics Department.\u201d\nIn the years that have followed, Musk\u2019s enemies have been quick to\nbring up the ambiguities around his admission to Stanford. When Martin\nEberhard sued Musk, his attorney introduced O\u2019Reilly\u2019s research into the\ncase. And during the course of my interviews, a number of Musk\u2019s\ndetractors from the Zip2, PayPal, and early Tesla days said flat out that they\nthink Musk fibbed about getting into Stanford in a bid to boost his\ncredentials as a fledgling entrepreneur and then had to stick with the story\nafter Zip2 took off.\nAt first, I, too, felt like there were a lot of oddities surrounding Musk\u2019s\nacademic record, particularly the Stanford days. But, as I dug in, there were\nsolid explanations for all of the inconsistencies and plenty of evidence to\nundermine the cases of Musk\u2019s detractors.", "During the course of my reporting, for example, I found evidence that\ncontradicted O\u2019Reilly\u2019s timeline of events. Peter Nicholson, the banker\nwhom Musk had worked for in Canada, took a stroll with Musk along the\nboardwalk in Toronto before Musk left for Stanford and chatted about the\nincarnations of something like Zip2. Musk had already started writing some\nof the early software to support the idea he\u2019d outlined to Kimbal. \u201cHe was\nagonizing whether to do a PhD at Stanford or take this piece of software\nhe\u2019d made in his spare time and make a business out of it,\u201d Nicholson said.\n\u201cHe called the thing the Virtual City Navigator. I told him there was this\ncrazy Internet thing going on, and that people will pay big money for damn\nnear anything. This software was a golden opportunity. He could do a PhD\nanytime.\u201d Kimbal and other members of Musk\u2019s family have similar\nmemories.\nMusk, speaking at length for the first time on the subject, denied\neverything alleged by O\u2019Reilly and does not even recall meeting the man.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a total scumbag,\u201d Musk said. \u201cO\u2019Reilly is like a failed physicist who\nbecame a serial litigate. And I told the guy, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not going to settle an\nunjust case. So it\u2019s just like don\u2019t even try.\u2019 But he still kept at it. His case\nwas tossed out twice on demur, which means that basically even if all the\nfacts in his case were true, he would still lose.\n\u201cHe\u2019d tried his best to like torture me through my friends and personally\n[by filing the lawsuit]. And then we\u2019ve got summary judgment. He lost the\nsummary judgment. He appealed summary judgment, then several months\nlater lost the appeal and I was like, \u2018Okay, fuck it. Let\u2019s file for fees.\u2019 And\nwe were awarded fees from when he appealed. And that\u2019s when we sent the\nsheriff after him and he claimed that he had no money basically. Whether he\ndid or didn\u2019t I don\u2019t know. He certainly claimed he had no money. So we\nwere like either we\u2019ve got to like impound his car or tap his wife\u2019s income.\nThose didn\u2019t seem like great choices. So, we decided that he doesn\u2019t have to\npay back the money he owes me, so long as he doesn\u2019t sue anyone else on\nfrivolous grounds. And, in fact, late last year or early this year [2014], he\ntried to do just that thing. But, whoever he sued was aware of the nature of\nmy judgment and contacted the lawyer I used, who then told O\u2019Reilly,\n\u2018Look, you need to drop the case against these guys or everyone\u2019s going to\nask for the money. It\u2019s kind of pointless to sue them on frivolous grounds\nbecause you\u2019re going to have fork over the winnings to Elon.\u2019 It\u2019s like go\ndo something productive with your life.\u201d", "As for his academic records, Musk produced a document for me dated\nJune 22, 2009, that came from Judith Haccou, the director of graduate\nadmissions in the office of the registrar at Stanford University. It read, \u201cAs\nper special request from my colleagues in the School of Engineering, I have\nsearched Stanford\u2019s admission data base and acknowledge that you applied\nand were admitted to the graduate program in Material Science Engineering\nin 1995. Since you did not enroll, Stanford is not able to issue you an\nofficial certification document.\u201d\nMusk also had an explanation for the weird timing on his degrees from\nPenn. \u201cI had a History and an English credit that I agreed with Penn that I\nwould do at Stanford,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I put Stanford on deferment. Later,\nPenn\u2019s requirements changed so that you don\u2019t need the English and History\ncredit. So then they awarded me the degree in \u201997 when it was clear I was\nnot going to go to grad school, and their requirement was no longer there.\n\u201cI finished everything that was needed for a Wharton degree in \u201994.\nThey\u2019d actually mailed me a Wharton degree. I decided to spend another\nyear and finished the physics degree, but then there was that History and\nEnglish credit thing. I was only reminded about the History and English\nthing when I tried to get an H-1B visa and called the school to get a copy of\nmy graduation certificate, and they said I hadn\u2019t graduated. Then they\nlooked into the new requirements, and said it was fine.\u201d", "APPENDIX 2\nW\nHILE MUSK HAS REFLECTED PUBLICLY ABOUT HIS TIME AT\nPAYPAL AND THE COUP, he went into far greater detail than ever before\nduring one of our longer interviews. Years had passed since the tumultuous\ndays surrounding his ouster, and Musk had been able to meditate more on\nwhat went right, what went wrong, and what might have been. He started by\ndiscussing his decision to go out of the country, mixing business with a\ndelayed honeymoon, and ended with an explanation of how the finance\nindustry still hasn\u2019t solved the problems X.com wanted to tackle.\n\u201cThe problem with me going away was that I was not there to reassure\nthe board on a few things. Like, the brand change, I think it would have\nbeen the right move, but it didn\u2019t need to happen right then. At the time it\nwas this weird almost hybrid brand with X.com and PayPal. I think X was\nthe right long-term brand for something that wants to be the central place\nwhere all transactions happen. That\u2019s the X. It\u2019s like the X is the transaction.\nPayPal doesn\u2019t make sense in that context, when we\u2019re talking about\nsomething more than a personal payment system. I think X was the more\nsensible approach but timing-wise it didn\u2019t need to happen then. That\nshould have probably waited longer.\n\u201cAs for the technology change, that\u2019s not really well understood. On the\nface of it, it doesn\u2019t sound like it makes much sense for us to be writing our\nfront-end code in Microsoft C++ instead of Linux. But the reason is that the\nprogramming tools for Microsoft and a PC are actually extremely powerful.\nThey\u2019re developed for the gaming industry. I mean, this is going to sound\nlike heresy in a sort of Silicon Valley context, but you can program faster,\nyou can get functionality faster in the PC C++ world. All of the games for\nthe Xbox are written in Microsoft C++. The same goes for games on the\nPC. They\u2019re incredibly sophisticated, hard things to do, and these great", "tools have been developed thanks to the gaming industry. There were more\nsmart programmers in the gaming industry than anywhere else. I\u2019m not sure\nthe general public understands this. It was also 2000, and there were not the\nhuge software libraries for Linux that you would find today. Microsoft had\nhuge support libraries. So you could get a DLL that could do anything, but\nyou couldn\u2019t get\u2014you couldn\u2019t get Linux libraries that could do anything.\n\u201cTwo of the guys that left PayPal went off to Blizzard and helped\ncreated World of Warcraft. When you look at the complexity of something\nlike that living on PCs and Microsoft C++, it\u2019s pretty incredible. It blows\naway any website.\n\u201cIn retrospect, I should have delayed the brand transition, and I should\nhave spent a lot more time with Max getting him comfortable on the\ntechnology. I mean, it was a little difficult because like the Linux system\nMax had created was called Max Code. So Max has had quite a strong\naffinity for Max Code. This was a bunch of libraries that Max and his\nfriends had done. But it just made it quite hard to develop new features.\nAnd if you look at PayPal today, I mean, part of the reason they haven\u2019t\ndeveloped any new features is because it\u2019s quite difficult to maintain the old\nsystem.\n\u201cUltimately, I didn\u2019t disagree with the board\u2019s decision in the PayPal\ncase, in the sense that with the information that the board had I would have\nmade maybe the same decision. I probably would have, whereas in the case\nof Zip2 I would not have. I thought they just simply made a terrible\ndecision based on information they had. I don\u2019t think the X.com board\nmade a terrible decision based on the information they had. But it did make\nme want to be careful about who invested in my companies in the future.\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about trying to get PayPal back. I\u2019ve just been too strung\nout with other things. Almost no one understands how PayPal actually\nworked or why it took off when other payment systems before and after it\ndidn\u2019t. Most of the people at PayPal don\u2019t understand this. The reason it\nworked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any\nother system. And the reason the cost of transactions was lower is because\nwe were able to do an increasing percentage of our transactions as ACH, or\nautomated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly,\ninternal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and\ncost us nothing. An ACH transaction costs, I don\u2019t know, like twenty cents\nor something. But it was slow, so that was the bad thing. It\u2019s dependent on", "the bank\u2019s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was\nfast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very\nprone to fraud. That\u2019s the problem Square is having now.\n\u201cSquare is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to\nachieve internal transactions. This is vital because they are instant, fraud-\nfree, and fee-free. If you\u2019re a seller and have various options, and PayPal\nhas the lowest fees and is the most secure, it\u2019s obviously the right thing to\nuse.\n\u201cWhen you look at like any given business, like say a business is\nmaking 10 percent profitability. They\u2019re making 10 percent profit when\nthey may net out all of their costs. You know, revenue minus expenses in a\nyear, they\u2019re 10 percent. If using PayPal means you pay 2 percent for your\ntransactions and using some other systems means you pay 4 percent, that\nmeans using PayPal gives you a 20 percent increase in your profitability.\nYou\u2019d have to be brain dead not to do that. Right?\n\u201cSo because about half of PayPal\u2019s transactions in the summer of 2001\nwere internal or ACH transactions, then our fundamental costs of\ntransactions were half because we\u2019d have half credit cards, we\u2019d have that\nand then the other half would be free. The question then is how do you give\npeople a reason to keep money in the system.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we created a PayPal debit card. It\u2019s a little counterintuitive,\nbut the easier you make it for people to get money out of PayPal, the less\nthey\u2019ll want to do it. But if the only way for them to spend money or access\nit in any way is to move it to a traditional bank, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do\ninstantly. The other thing was the PayPal money market fund. We did that\nbecause if you consider the reasons that people might move the money out,\nwell, they\u2019ll move it to either conduct transactions in the physical world or\nbecause they\u2019re getting a higher interest rate. So I instituted the highest-\nreturn money market fund in the country. Basically, the money market fund\nwas at cost. We didn\u2019t intend to make any money on it, in order to\nencourage people to keep their money in the system. And then we also had\nlike the ability to pay regular bills like your electricity bill and that kind of\nthing on PayPal.\n\u201cThere were a bunch of things that should have been done like checks.\nBecause even though people don\u2019t use a lot of checks they still use some\nchecks. So if you force people to say, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not going to let you use", "checks ever,\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, I guess I have to have a bank account.\u2019\nJust give them a few checks, for God\u2019s sake.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s so ridiculous that PayPal today is worse than PayPal circa\nend of 2001. That\u2019s insane.\n\u201cNone of these start-ups understand the objective. The objective should\nbe\u2014what delivers fundamental value. I think it\u2019s important to look at things\nfrom a standpoint of what is actually the best thing for the economy. If\npeople can conduct their transactions quickly and securely that\u2019s better for\nthem. If it\u2019s simpler to conduct their financial life it\u2019s better for them. So, if\nall your financial affairs are seamlessly integrated one place it\u2019s very easy to\ndo transactions and the fees associated with transactions are low. These are\nall good things. Why aren\u2019t they doing this? It\u2019s mad.\u201d", "APPENDIX 3\nFrom: Elon Musk\nDate: June 7, 2013, 12:43:06 AM PDT\nTo: All <All@spacex.com>\nSubject: Going Public\nPer my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about\nSpaceX going public before the Mars transport system is in place.\nCreating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and\nalways has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public\ncompany diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until\nMars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering,\nbut, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to\nfoist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature\nof our mission.\nSome at SpaceX who have not been through a public company\nexperience may think that being public is desirable. This is not so.\nPublic company stocks, particularly if big step changes in\ntechnology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for\nreasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do\nwith anything except the economy. This causes people to be\ndistracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of\ncreating great products.\nIt is important to emphasize that Tesla and SolarCity are public\nbecause they didn\u2019t have any choice. Their private capital structure\nwas becoming unwieldy and they needed to raise a lot of equity\ncapital. SolarCity also needed to raise a huge amount of debt at the\nlowest possible interest rate to fund solar leases. The banks who\nprovide that debt wanted SolarCity to have the additional and", "painful scrutiny that comes with being public. Those rules, referred\nto as Sarbanes-Oxley, essentially result in a tax being levied on\ncompany execution by requiring detailed reporting right down to\nhow your meal is expensed during travel and you can be penalized\neven for minor mistakes.\nYES, BUT I COULD MAKE MORE MONEY IF\nWE WERE PUBLIC\nFor those who are under the impression that they are so clever that\nthey can outsmart public market investors and would sell SpaceX\nstock at the \u201cright time,\u201d let me relieve you of any such notion. If\nyou really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is\nno need to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can\njust invest in other public company stocks and make billions of\ndollars in the market.\nIf you think: \u201cAh, but I know what\u2019s really going on at SpaceX\nand that will give me an edge,\u201d you are also wrong. Selling public\ncompany stock with insider knowledge is illegal. As a result, selling\npublic stock is restricted to narrow time windows a few times per\nyear. Even then, you can be prosecuted for insider trading. At Tesla,\nwe had both an employee and an investor go through a grand jury\ninvestigation for selling stock over a year ago, despite them doing\neverything right in both the letter and spirit of the law. Not fun.\nAnother thing that happens to public companies is that you\nbecome a target of the trial lawyers who create a class action lawsuit\nby getting someone to buy a few hundred shares and then pretending\nto sue the company on behalf of all investors for any drop in the\nstock price. Tesla is going through that right now even though the\nstock price is relatively high, because the drop in question occurred\nlast year.\nIt is also not correct to think that because Tesla and SolarCity\nshare prices are on the lofty side right now, that SpaceX would be\ntoo. Public companies are judged on quarterly performance. Just\nbecause some companies are doing well, doesn\u2019t mean that all", "would. Both of those companies (Tesla in particular) had great first\nquarter results. SpaceX did not. In fact, financially speaking, we had\nan awful first quarter. If we were public, the short sellers would be\nhitting us over the head with a large stick.\nWe would also get beaten up every time there was an anomaly\non the rocket or spacecraft, as occurred on flight 4 with the engine\nfailure and flight 5 with the Dragon prevalves. Delaying launch of\nV1.1, which is now over a year behind schedule, would result in\nparticularly severe punishment, as that is our primary revenue\ndriver. Even something as minor as pushing a launch back a few\nweeks from one quarter to the next gets you a spanking. Tesla\nvehicle production in Q4 last year was literally only three weeks\nbehind and yet the market response was brutal.\nBEST OF BOTH WORLDS\nMy goal at SpaceX is to give you the best aspects of a public and\nprivate company. When we do a financing round, the stock price is\nkeyed off of approximately what we would be worth if publicly\ntraded, excluding irrational exuberance or depression, but without\nthe pressure and distraction of being under a hot public spotlight.\nRather than have the stock be up during one liquidity window and\ndown during another, the goal is a steady upward trend and never to\nlet the share price go below the last round. The end result for you (or\nan investor in SpaceX) financially will be the same as if we were\npublic and you sold a steady amount of stock every year.\nIn case you are wondering about a specific number, I can say\nthat I\u2019m confident that our long term stock price will be over $100 if\nwe execute well on Falcon 9 and Dragon. For this to be the case, we\nmust have a steady and rapid cadence of launch that is far better\nthan what we have achieved in the past. We have more work ahead\nof us than you probably realize. Let me give you a sense of where\nthings stand financially: SpaceX expenses this year will be roug[h]ly\n$800 to $900 million (which blows my mind btw). Since we get\nrevenue of $60M for every F9 flight or double that for a FH or F9-\nDragon flight, we must have about twelve flights per year where", "four of those flights are either Dragon or Heavy merely in order to\nachieve 10% profitability!\nFor the next few years, we have NASA commercial crew\nfunding that helps supplement those numbers, but, after that, we are\non our own. That is not much time to finish F9, FH, Dragon V2 and\nachieve an average launch rate of at least one per month. And bear\nin mind that is an average, so if we take an extra three weeks to\nlaunch a rocket for any reason (could even be due to the satellite),\nwe have only one week to do the follow-on flight.\nMY RECOMMENDATION\nBelow is my advice about regarding selling SpaceX stock or\noptions. No complicated analysis is required, as the rules of thumb\nare pretty simple.\nIf you believe that SpaceX will execute better than the average\npublic company, then our stock price will continue to appreciate at a\nrate greater than that of the stock market, which would be the next\nhighest return place to invest money over the long term. Therefore,\nyou should sell only the amount that you need to improve your\nstandard of living in the short to medium term. I do actually\nrecommend selling some amount of stock, even if you are certain it\nwill appreciate, as life is short and a bit more cash can increase fun\nand reduce stress at home (so long as you don\u2019t ratchet up your\nongoing personal expenditures proportionately).\nTo maximize your post tax return, you are probably best off\nexercising your options to convert them to stock (if you can afford\nto do this) and then holding the stock for a year before selling it at\nour roughly biannual liquidity events. This allows you to pay the\ncapital gains tax rate, instead of the income tax rate.\nOn a final note, we are planning to do a liquidity event as soon\nas Falcon 9 qualification is complete in one to two months. I don\u2019t\nknow exactly what the share price will be yet, but, based on initial\nconversations with investors, I would estimate probably between\n$30 and $35. This places the value of SpaceX at $4 to $5 billion,\nwhich is about what it would be if we were public right now and,", "frankly, an excellent number considering that the new F9, FH and\nDragon V2 have yet to launch.\nElon", "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nF\nROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, this will always be two books\ninstead of one in my mind. There\u2019s the time Before Elon, and the time After\nElon.\nThe first eighteen months or so of reporting were filled with tension,\nsorrow, and joy. As mentioned in the main text, Musk initially opted against\nhelping me with the project. This left me going from interview subject to\ninterview subject, giving a huge windup each time to try to talk an ex-Tesla\nemployee or an old schoolmate into an interview. The highs came when\npeople agreed to talk. The lows came when key people said no and to not\nbother them again. String four or five of those no\u2019s together in a row, and it\nfelt at times like writing a proper book about Musk was impossible.\nThe thing that keeps you going is that a few people do say yes and then\na few more, and\u2014interview by interview\u2014you start to figure out how the\npast fits together. I\u2019ll be forever grateful to the hundreds of people who\nwere willing to give freely of their time and especially to those who let me\ncome back again and again with questions. There are too many of these\npeople to list, but gracious souls\u2014like Jeremy Hollman, Kevin Brogan,\nDave Lyons, Ali Javidan, Michael Colonno, and Dolly Singh\u2014each\nprovided invaluable insights and abundant technical help. Heartfelt thanks\ngo as well to Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, both of whom added\ncrucial, rich parts to the Tesla story.\nEven in this Before Elon period, Musk did permit some of his closer\nfriends to speak with me, and they were generous with their time and\nintellect. That\u2019s a special thanks then to George Zachary and Shervin\nPishevar, and especially to Bill Lee, Antonio Gracias, and Steve Jurvetson,\nwho really went out of their way for Musk and for me. And I obviously owe\na tremendous debt of gratitude to Justine Musk, Maye Musk, Kimbal Musk,", "Peter Rive, Lyndon Rive, Russ Rive, and Scott Haldeman for their time and\nfor letting me hear some of the family stories. Talulah Riley was kind\nenough to let me interview her and keep prying into her husband\u2019s life. She\nreally brought out some aspects of Musk\u2019s personality that I had not\nencountered elsewhere, and she helped build a much deeper understanding\nof him. This meant a lot to me, and, I think, it will to the readers as well.\nOnce Musk agreed to work with me, much of the tension that\naccompanied the reporting went away and was replaced by excitement. I\ngot access to people like JB Straubel, Franz von Holzhausen, Diarmuid\nO\u2019Connell, Tom Mueller, and Gwynne Shotwell, who are all among the\nmost intelligent and compelling figures I\u2019ve run into during years of\nreporting. I\u2019m forever grateful for their patience explaining bits of company\nhistory and technological basics to me and for their candor. Thanks as well\nto Emily Shanklin, Hannah Post, Alexis Georgeson, Liz Jarvis-Shean, and\nJohn Taylor, for dealing with my constant requests and pestering, and for\nsetting up so many interviews at Musk\u2019s companies. Mary Beth Brown,\nChristina Ra, and Shanna Hendriks were no longer part of Musk Land near\nthe end of my reporting but were all amazing in helping me learn about\nMusk, Tesla, and SpaceX.\nMy biggest debt of gratitude, of course, goes to Musk. When we first\nstarted doing the interviews, I would spend the hours leading up to our chats\nfull of nerves. I never knew how long Musk would keep participating in the\nproject. He might have given me one interview or ten. There was real\npressure to get my most crucial questions answered up front and to be to the\npoint in my initial interviewing. As Musk stuck around, though, the\nconversations went longer, were more fluid, and became more enlightening.\nThey were the things I most looked forward to every month. Whether Musk\nwill change the course of human history in a massive way remains to be\nseen, but it was certainly a thrilling privilege to get to pick the brain of\nsomeone who is reaching so high. While reticent at first, once Musk\ncommitted to the project, he committed fully, and I\u2019m thankful and honored\nthat things turned out that way.\nOn a professional front, I\u2019d like to thank my editors and coworkers over\nthe years\u2014China Martens, James Niccolai, John Lettice, Vindu Goel, and\nSuzanne Spector\u2014each of whom taught me different lessons about the craft\nof writing. Special thanks go to Andrew Orlowski, Tim O\u2019Brien, Damon\nDarlin, Jim Aley, and Drew Cullen, who have had the most impact on how I", "think about writing and reporting and are among the best mentors anyone\ncould hope for. I must also offer up infinite thanks to Brad Wieners and\nJosh Tyrangiel, my bosses at Bloomberg Businessweek, for giving me the\nfreedom to pursue this project. I doubt there are two people doing more to\nsupport quality journalism.\nA special brand of thanks goes to Brad Stone, my colleague at the New\nYork Times and then at Businessweek. Brad helped me shape the idea for\nthis book, coaxed me through dark times, and was an unrivaled sounding\nboard. I feel bad for pestering Brad so incessantly with my questions and\ndoubts. Brad is a model colleague, always there to help anyone with advice\nor to step up and take on work. He\u2019s an amazing writer and an incredible\nfriend.\nThanks as well to Keith Lee and Sheila Abichandani Sandfort. They are\ntwo of the brightest, kindest, most genuine people I know, and their\nfeedback on the early text was invaluable.\nMy agent David Patterson and editor Hilary Redmon were instrumental\nin helping pull this project off. David always seemed to say the right thing\nat low moments to pick up my spirits. Frankly, I doubt the book would have\nhappened without the encouragement and momentum he provided during\nthe initial part of the project. Once things got going, Hilary talked me\nthrough the trickiest moments and elevated the book to an unexpected\nplace. She tolerated my hissy fits and made dramatic improvements to the\nwriting. It\u2019s wonderful to finish something like this and come out the other\nside with a pair of such good friends. Thanks so much to you both.\nLast, I have to thank my family. This book turned into a living,\nbreathing creature that made life difficult on my family for more than two\nyears. I didn\u2019t get to see my young boys as much as I would have liked\nduring this time, but when I did they were there with energizing smiles and\nhugs. I\u2019m thankful that they both seem to have picked up an interest in\nrockets and cars as a result of this project. As for my wife, Melinda, well,\nshe was a saint. From a practical perspective, this book could not have\nhappened without her support. Melinda was my best reader and ultimate\nconfidante. She was that best friend who knew when to try to energize me\nand when to let things go. Even though this book disrupted our lives for a\nlong while, it brought us closer together in the end. I\u2019m blessed to have such\na partner, and I will forever remember what Melinda did for our family.", "NOTES\n1.

Another moment like this occurred in late 2010 during a launch attempt in Florida. One of the\nSpaceX technicians had left a hatch open overnight at the launchpad, which allowed rain to\nflood a lower-level computing room. The water caused major issues with SpaceX\u2019s computing\nequipment, and another technician had to fly out from California right away with Musk\u2019s\nAmerican Express card in hand to fix the emergency in the days leading up to the launch.\nThe SpaceX engineers bought new computing gear right away and set it up in the room.\nThey needed to run the equipment through standard tests to make sure it could maintain a\ncertain voltage level. It was late at night on a Sunday, and they couldn\u2019t get access on short\nnotice to a device that could simulate the high electrical load. One of the engineers improvised\nby going to a hardware store where he bought twenty-five headlamps for golf carts. The SpaceX\ncrew strung them all together back at the launchpad and hung them from a wall. They then put\non their sunglasses and lit everything up, knowing that if a power supply for the computing\nequipment could survive this test, it would be okay for the flight. The process was repeated for\nnumerous power supplies, and the team worked from 9 P.M. that night until 7 A.M. and finished\nin time to keep the launch on track.\n13. http://www.space.com/15874-private-dragon-capsule-space-station-arrival.xhtml.", "14. At the conclusion of the debate, Musk and I exchanged a couple of emails. He wrote, \u201cOil and\ngas is firmly in the Romney camp and they are feeding his campaign these talking points. Until\nrecently, they didn\u2019t care about Tesla, as they thought we would fail.\n\u201cIronically, it is because they are starting to think Tesla might not fail that they are attacking\nus. The reason is that society has to function, so the less there seems to be a viable alternative to\nburning hydrocarbons, the less pressure there is to curb carbon emissions. If an electric car\nsucceeds, it spoils that argument.\n\u201cOverall though, I think it is great that he mentioned us :) \u2018Romney Tesla\u2019 is one of the top\nGoogle searches!\u201d\nI reached out to Romney\u2019s camp months later, as sales of Tesla\u2019s soared, to see if he wanted\nto change his position but was rebuffed.\n15. As Tesla has grown in size, the company has commanded more respect from suppliers and been\nable to get better parts and better deals. But outsourcing components still bothers Musk, and for\nunderstandable reasons. When it tried to ramp up production in 2013, Tesla ran into periodic\nissues because of its suppliers. One of them made what should have been an inconsequential 12-\nvolt lead acid battery that handled a few auxiliary functions in the car. Tesla bought the part\nfrom an American supplier, which in turn outsourced the part from a company in China, which\nin turn outsourced the part from a company in Vietnam. By the time the battery arrived at Tesla\u2019s\nfactories, it didn\u2019t work, adding cost and delays during a crucial period in the Model S\u2019s history.\nIt\u2019s situations like these that typically result in Tesla playing a much more active role with its\nsuppliers when compared to other automakers. For something like an ABS braking controller,\nTesla will work hand-in-hand with its supplier\u2014in this case Bosch\u2014to tune the hardware and\nsoftware for the Model S\u2019s specific characteristics. \u201cMost companies just hand their cars over to\nBosch, but Tesla goes in with a software engineer,\u201d said Ali Javidan. \u201cWe had to change their\nmind-set and let them know we wanted to work on a very deep level.\u201d\n16. Tesla does seem to promote an obsession with safety that\u2019s unmatched in the industry. J. B.\nStraubel explained the company\u2019s thinking as follows: \u201cWith the safety stuff, it seems like car\ncompanies have evolved to a place where their design objectives are set by whatever is regulated\nor has been standardized. The rule says, \u2018Do this and nothing more.\u2019 That is amazingly boring\nengineering. It leaves you maybe fiddling with the car\u2019s shape or trying to make it a bit faster.\nWe have more crumple zones, better deceleration, a lower center of gravity. We went in\nwondering, \u2018Can we make this car twice as safe as anything else on the road?\u2019\u201d\n17. Othmer has lined up to be the lucky owner of the first Roadster II.\nMusk has developed an unconventional policy to determine the order in which cars are sold.\nWhen a new car is announced and its price is set, a race begins in which the first person to hand\nMusk a check gets the first car. With the Model S, Steve Jurvetson, a Tesla board member, had a\ncheck at the ready in his wallet and slid it across the table to Musk after spying details on the\nModel S in a packet of board meeting notes.\nOthmer caught a Wired story about a planned second version of the Roadster and emailed\nMusk right away. \u201cHe said, \u2018Okay, I will sell it to you, but you have to pay two hundred\nthousand dollars right now.\u2019\u201d Othmer agreed, and Tesla had him come to the company\u2019s\nheadquarters on a Sunday to sign some paperwork, acknowledging the price of the car and the\nfact that the company didn\u2019t quite know when it would arrive or what its specifications would\nbe. \u201cMy guess is that it will be the fastest car on the road,\u201d Othmer said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be four-wheel\ndrive. It\u2019s going to be insane. And I don\u2019t really think that will be the real price. I just don\u2019t\nthink Elon wanted me to buy it.\u201d\n18. Musk suspected Better Place came up with battery swapping as a plan after its CEO, Shai\nAgassi, heard about the technology during a tour of the Tesla factory\n19. Musk had made a number of art cars over the years at Burning Man, including an electric one\nshaped like a rocket. In 2011, he also received a lot of grief from the Wall Street Journal for", "having a high-end camp. \u201cElon Musk, chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Motors and\nco-founder of eBay Inc.\u2019s PayPal unit, is among those eschewing the tent life,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\u201cHe is paying for an elaborate compound consisting of eight recreational vehicles and trailers\nstocked with food, linens, groceries and other essentials for himself and his friends and family,\nsay employees of the outfitter, Classic Adventures RV. . . . Classic is one of the festival\u2019s few\napproved vendors. It charges $5,500 to $10,000 per RV for its Camp Classic Concierge\npackages like Mr. Musk\u2019s. At Mr. Musk\u2019s RV enclave, the help empties septic tanks, brings\nwater and makes sure the vehicles\u2019 electricity, refrigeration, air conditioning, televisions, DVD\nplayers and other systems are ship shape. The staff also stocked the campers with Diet Coke,\nGatorade and Cruzan rum.\u201d Once the story hit, Musk\u2019s group felt like Classic Adventures had\nleaked the information to drum up business, and they tried to move to a new, undisclosed\nlocation.\n20. http://www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf.\n21. Tesla employees have been known to sneak across the street to the campus of the software\nmaker SAP and to take advantage of its sumptuous, subsidized cafes.\n22. Shotwell talks about going to Mars as much as Musk and has dedicated her life to space\nexploration. Straubel has demonstrated the same type of commitment with electric vehicles and\ncan sound a lot like Musk at times. \u201cWe are not trying to corner the market on EVs,\u201d Straubel\nsaid. \u201cThere are 100 million cars built per year and 2 billion already out there. Even if we got to\n5 or 10 percent of the market, that does not solve the world\u2019s problems. I am bullish we will\nkeep up with demand and drive the whole industry forward. Elon is committed to this.\u201d\n23. Page presented one of his far-out ideas to me as follows: \u201cI was thinking it would be pretty cool\nto have a prize to fund a project where someone would have to send something lightweight to\nthe moon that could sort of replicate itself. I went over to the NASA operation center here at\nAMES in Mountain View when they were doing a mission and literally flying a satellite into the\nsouth pole of the moon. And they like hurled this thing into the moon at a high velocity and then\nit exploded and it sent matter out into space. And then they looked at that with telescopes, and\nthey discovered water on the south pole of the moon, which sounds really exciting. I started\nthinking that if there\u2019s a lot of water on the south pole of the moon, you can make rocket fuel\nfrom the hydrogen and oxygen. The other cool thing about the south pole is like it almost always\ngets sun. There\u2019s like places high up that get sun and there\u2019s places that are kind of in the craters\nthat are very cold. So you have like a lot of energy then where you could run solar cells. You\ncould almost run like a steam turbine there. You have rocket fuel ingredients, and you have solar\ncells that can be powered by sun, and you could probably run a power plant turbine. Power plant\nturbines aren\u2019t that heavy. You could send that to the moon. You have like a gigawatt of power\non the moon and make a lot of rocket fuel. It would make a good prize project. You send\nsomething to the moon that weights five pounds and have it make rocket fuel so that you could\nlaunch stuff off the moon or have it make a copy of itself, so that you can make more of them.\u201d", "ABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAuthor photograph \u00a9 by Melinda Vance\nASHLEE VANCE is one of the most prominent writers on technology\ntoday.

He would later make an unsuccessful\nrun for Parliament and chair the Social Credit Party.", "* The journey took them up the African coast, across the Arabian Peninsula, all the way through\nIran, India, and Malaysia and then down the Timor Sea to Australia. It required one year of\npreparation just to secure all of the necessary visas and paperwork, and they suffered from\nconstant stomach bugs and an erratic schedule along the way. \u201cDad passed out crossing the Timor\nSea, and mum had to take over until they hit Australia.

I\nwant your head to hurt every night when you go to bed.\u201d", "* Musk fought to set the record straight, as he saw it, on the Huffington Post and wrote a 1,500-\nword essay. Musk maintained that two months of negotiations with independent parties had gone\ninto the postnuptial agreement, which kept the couple\u2019s assets separate so that Musk could get the\nspoils from his companies and Justine could get the spoils from her books. \u201cIn mid 1999, Justine\ntold me that if I proposed to her, she would say yes,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSince this was not long after\nthe sale of my first company, Zip2, to Compaq, and the subsequent cofounding of PayPal, friends\nand family advised me to separate whether the marriage was for love or money.\u201d After the\nsettlement, Musk asked Arianna Huffington to remove his essay about the divorce from her\nwebsite. \u201cI don\u2019t want to dwell on past negativity,\u201d Musk said. \u201cYou can always find things on the\nInternet. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s just not easily found.\u201d", "* The pair have continued to have their difficulties. For a long time, Musk ran all of the child-\nsharing scheduling through his assistant Mary Beth Brown rather than dealing directly with\nJustine. \u201cI was really pissed-off about that,\u201d Justine said. And the time Justine cried the most\nduring our conversation came as she weighed the pros and cons of the children growing up on a\ngrand stage where they\u2019re whisked away to the Super Bowl or Spain in a private jet on a\nmoment\u2019s notice or asked to play at the Tesla factory. \u201cI know the kids really look up to him,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHe takes them everywhere and provides a lot of experiences for them. My role as the\nmother is to create this reality where I provide a sense of normalcy. They are not growing up in a\nnormal family with a normal dad. Their life with me is a lot more low-key. We value different\nthings. I am a lot more about empathy.\u201d", "* Musk recalled their meeting as follows: \u201cShe did look great, but what was going through my\nmind was \u2018Oh, I guess they are a couple of models.\u2019 You know, you can\u2019t actually talk to most\nmodels. You just can\u2019t have a conversation. But, you know, Talulah was really interested in\ntalking about rockets and electric cars. That was the interesting thing.\u201d", "* He asked Riley to go with him, but she turned Musk down.", "* By this time, Musk had built up a reputation as the hardest-charging man in the space business.\nBefore settling on the Falcon 9, Musk planned to build something called the BFR, a.k.a. the Big\nFalcon Rocket or Big Fucking Rocket. Musk wanted it to have the biggest rocket engine in\nhistory. Musk\u2019s bigger, faster mentality amused, horrified and impressed some of the suppliers\nthat SpaceX occasionally turned to for help, like Barber-Nichols Inc., a Colorado-based maker of\nrocket engine turbo pumps and other aerospace machinery. A few executives at Barber-Nichols\u2014\nRobert Linden, Gary Frey, and Mike Forsha\u2014were kind enough to recount their first meeting\nwith Musk in the middle of 2002 and their subsequent dealings with him. Here\u2019s a snippet:\n\u201cElon showed up with Tom Mueller and started telling us it was his destiny to launch things\ninto space at lower costs and to help us become space faring people. We thought the world of\nTom but weren\u2019t quite sure whether to take Elon too seriously. They began asking us for the\nimpossible. They wanted a turbo pump to be built in less than a year for under one million\ndollars. Boeing might do a project like that over five years for one hundred million. Tom told us\nto give it our best shot, and we built it in thirteen months. Build quick and learn quickly was\nElon\u2019s philosophy. He was relentless in wanting the costs to come down. Regardless of what we\nshowed him on paper with regard to the cost of materials, he wanted the cost lower because that\nwas part of his business model. It could be very frustrating to work with Elon. He has a singular\nview and doesn\u2019t deviate from that. We don\u2019t know too many people that have worked for him\nthat are happy. That said, he has driven the cost of space down and been true to his original\nbusiness plan. Boeing, Lockheed, and the rest of them have become overly cautious and spend a\nlot of money. SpaceX has balls.\u201d", "* To provide a glimpse of how well Musk knows the rockets, here he is explaining what happened\nfrom memory six years after the fact: \u201cIt was because we had upgraded the Merlin engine to a\nregeneratively cooled engine and the thrust transient of that engine was a few seconds longer. It\nwas only like one percent thrust for about another 1.5 seconds. And the chamber pressure was\nonly ten PSI, which is one percent of the total. But that\u2019s below sea level pressure. On the test\nstand, we didn\u2019t notice anything. We thought it was fine. We thought it was just the same as\nbefore, but actually it just had this slight difference. The ambient sea level pressure was higher at\nroughly fifteen PSI, which disguised some effects during the test. The extra thrust caused the first\nstage to continue moving after stage separation and recontact the other stage. And the upper stage\nthen started the engine inside the interstage, which caused the plasma blowback which destroyed\nthat upper stage.\u201d", "* Musk would later discover the identity of this employee in an ingenious way. He copied the text\nof the letter into a Word document, checked the size of the file, sent it to a printer, and looked\nover the logs of printer activity to find one of the same size. He could then trace that back to the\nperson who had printed the original file. The employee wrote a letter of apology and resigned.", "* Griffin had pined to build a massive new spacecraft that would solidify his mark on the industry.\nBut, with the election of Barack Obama in 2008, the Bush appointee knew that his time as NASA\nchief was coming to an end and that SpaceX appeared poised to build the most interesting\nmachines moving forward.", "* It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt reusable rockets\nwill work, in large part because of the stress the machines and metal go through during launch.\nIt\u2019s not clear that the most prized customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches\ndue to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and companies have not\npursued the technology. There\u2019s a camp of space experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his\ntime, and that engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a fool\u2019s errand.", "* Blue Origin also hired away a large chunk of SpaceX\u2019s propulsion team.", "* Musk has taken exception to Blue Origin and Bezos filing for patents around reusable rocket\ntechnology as well. \u201cHis patent is completely ridiculous,\u201d Musk said. \u201cPeople have proposed\nlanding on a floating platform in the ocean for a half century. There\u2019s no chance whatsoever of\nthe patent being upheld because there\u2019s five decades of prior art of people who proposed that six\nways to Sunday in fiction and nonfiction. It\u2019s like Dr. Seuss, green eggs and fucking ham. That\u2019s\nhow many ways it\u2019s been proposed. The issue is doing it and like actually creating a rocket that\ncan make that happen.\u201d", "* Michael Colonno.", "* According to Musk, \u201cThe early Dragon Version 1 work was just me and maybe three or four\nengineers, as we were living hand to mouth and had no idea if NASA would award us a contract.\nTechnically, there was Magic Dragon before that, which was much simpler, as it had no NASA\nrequirements. Magic Dragon was just me and some high altitude balloon guys in the U.K.\u201d", "* NASA researchers studying the Dragon design have noticed several features of the capsule that\nappear to have been purpose built from the get-go to accommodate a landing on Mars. They\u2019ve\npublished a couple of papers explaining how it could be feasible for NASA to fund a mission to\nMars in which a Dragon capsule picks up samples and returns them to Earth.", "* The politicking in the space business can get quite nasty. Lori Garver, the former deputy\nadministrator of NASA, spent years fighting to open up NASA contracts so that private\ncompanies could bid on things like resupplying the ISS. Her position of fostering a strong\nrelationship between NASA and the private sector won out in the end but at a cost. \u201cI had death\nthreats and fake anthrax sent to me,\u201d she said. Garver also ran across SpaceX competitors that\ntried to spread unfounded gossip about the company and Musk. \u201cThey claimed he was in\nviolation of tax laws in South Africa and had another, secret family there. I said, \u2018You\u2019re making\nthis stuff up.\u2019 We\u2019re lucky that people with such long-term visions as Elon, Jeff Bezos, and\nRobert Bigelow [founder of the aerospace company that bears his name] got rich. It\u2019s nuts that\npeople would want to vilify Elon. He might say some things that rub people the wrong way, but,\nat some point, the being nice to everyone thing doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "* On this flight, SpaceX secretly placed a wheel of cheese inside the Dragon capsule. It was the\nsame one Jeff Skoll had given Musk back in the mice-to-Mars days.", "* Musk explained the look to me in a way that only he can. \u201cI went for a similar style to the Model\nS (it uses the same screens as Model S upgraded for space ops), but kept the aluminum isogrid\nuncovered for a more exotic feel.\u201d", "* Rather insanely, NASA is building a next-generation, giant spaceship that could one day get to\nMars even though SpaceX is building the same type of craft\u2014the Falcon Heavy\u2014on its own.\nNASA\u2019s program is budgeted to cost $18 billion, although government studies say that figure is\nvery conservative. \u201cNASA has no fucking business doing this,\u201d said Andrew Beal, the billionaire\ninvestor and onetime commercial space entrepreneur. \u201cThe whole space shuttle system was a\ndisaster. They\u2019re fucking clueless. Who in their right mind would use huge solid boosters,\nespecially ones built in segments requiring dynamic seals? They are so lucky they only had one\ndisastrous failure of the boosters.\u201d Beal\u2019s firm criticisms come from years of watching the\ngovernment compete against private space companies by subsidizing the construction of\nspacecraft and launches. His company Beal Aerospace quit the business because the government\nkept funding competing rockets. \u201cGovernments around the world have spent billions trying to do\nwhat Elon is doing, and they have failed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have governments, but the idea\nthat the government goes out and competes with companies is fucking nuts.\u201d", "* The volume level on the sound system naturally goes to 11\u2014an homage to This Is Spinal Tap and\na reflection of Musk\u2019s sense of humor.", "* And it\u2019s not just that the Model S and other electric cars are three to four times more efficient\nthan internal combustion vehicles. They can also tap into power that is produced in centralized,\nefficient ways by power plants and solar arrays.", "* When the very first Roadster arrived, it came in a large plywood crate. Tesla\u2019s engineers\nunpacked it furiously, installed the battery pack, and then let Musk take it for a spin. About\ntwenty Tesla engineers jumped in prototype vehicles and formed a convoy that followed Musk\naround Palo Alto and Stanford.", "* At some point from late 2007 to 2008, Musk also tried to hire Tony Fadell, an executive at Apple\nwho is credited with bringing the iPod and iPhone to life. Fadell remembered being recruited for\nthe CEO job at Tesla, while Musk remembered it more as a chief operating officer type of\nposition. \u201cElon and I had multiple discussions about me joining as Tesla\u2019s CEO, and he even\nwent to the lengths of staging a surprise party for me when I was going to visit their offices,\u201d\nFadell said. Steve Jobs caught wind of these meetings and turned on the charm to keep Fadell.\n\u201cHe was sure nice to me for a while,\u201d Fadell said. A couple of years later, Fadell left Apple to\nfound Nest, a maker of smart-home devices, which Google then acquired in 2014.", "* It took a couple of years, from about 2007 to 2009, for the Energy Department application to\nmorph into the actual possibility of a loan from the government.", "* The deal had two parts. Tesla would keep making battery packs and associated technology that\nother companies might use, and it would produce its own electric vehicles at a manufacturing\nfacility in the United States.", "* Musk had received a lot of pushback internally for trying to locate a car factory in or near\nCalifornia. \u201cAll the guys in Detroit said it needs to be in a place where the labor can afford to live\nand be happy,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of learned skill on an assembly line, and you can\u2019t\nafford turnover.\u201d Musk responded that SpaceX had found a way to build rockets in Los Angeles,\nand that Tesla would find a way to build cars in Northern California. His stubbornness ended up\nbeing fortuitous for the company. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for that DOE loan, and the NUMMI plant,\nthere\u2019s no way Tesla would have ended up being so successful, so fast,\u201d Lloyd said.", "* Boeing used to make fuselages for the 747 in the SpaceX building and painted them in what\nbecame the Tesla design studio.", "* \u201cHe picks the most visible place on purpose,\u201d said the investor and Tesla board member Steve\nJurvetson. \u201cHe\u2019s at Tesla just about every Saturday and Sunday and wants people to see him and\nknow they can find him. Then, he can also call suppliers on the weekend, and let them know that\nhe\u2019s personally putting in the hours on the factory floor and expects the same from them.\u201d", "* Tesla got its start using the same lithium ion batteries that go into consumer electronics like\nlaptops. During the early days of the Roadster, this proved a risky but calculated choice. Tesla\nwanted to tap into Asia\u2019s mature battery suppliers and get access to cheap products that would\nkeep improving over time. The press played up Tesla\u2019s use of these types of batteries, and\nconsumers were fascinated by the idea that a car could be powered by the same energy source\nsitting inside of their gizmos.\nThere\u2019s a major misconception that Tesla still depends on these types of batteries. Yes, the\nbatteries inside the Model S look like those found in a laptop. Tesla, however, started developing\nits own battery chemistry in conjunction with partners like Panasonic dating back to late models\nof the Roadster. Tesla can still use the same manufacturing equipment as consumer electronics\ncompanies while ending up with a battery that\u2019s safer and better tuned to the intense charging\ndemands of its cars. Along with the secret formula for the battery cells themselves, Tesla has\nimproved the performance of its batteries by developing its own techniques for linking the cells\ntogether and cooling them. The battery cells have been designed to vent heat in a very particular\nway, and there\u2019s coolant running throughout the entire battery pack. The battery packs are\nassembled at the Tesla factory in an area hidden from visitors.\nThe chemistry, the batteries, the battery pack design\u2014these are all elements of a large,\ncontinuous system that Tesla has built from the ground up to allow its cars to charge at record\nspeed. To control the heat produced during the charging process, Tesla has designed an\ninterlinked system of radiators and chillers to cool both the batteries and the chargers. \u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot all that hardware plus the software management system and other controllers,\u201d said J. B.\nStraubel. \u201cAll of these things are running at maximum rate.\u201d A Model S can recharge 150 miles\nof range in 20 minutes at one of Tesla\u2019s charging stations with DC power pumping straight into\nthe batteries. By comparison, a Nissan Leaf that maxes out at 80 miles of range can take 8 hours\nto recharge.", "* Google\u2019s attorneys had asked to make a presentation to Tesla\u2019s board. Before he would permit\nthis, Musk asked for the right to call on Google for a loan in case Tesla encountered cash flow\nissues after acquisition talks became public, as there would otherwise be no way for Tesla to raise\nmoney. Google hesitated on this for a few weeks, by which time Tesla ended up in the clear.", "* Following the demonstration, Tesla struggled to deliver on the battery swap technology. Musk\nhad promised that the first few stations would arrive in late 2013. A year after the event, though,\nTesla had yet to open a single station. According to Musk, the company ended up needing to deal\nwith more pressing issues. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it because we said we\u2019d do it,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt may\nnot be on the schedule that we\u2019d like but we always come through in the end.\u201d", "* As for the origins of the Model S name, Musk said, \u201cWell, I like calling things what they are. We\nhad the Roadster, but there was no good word for a sedan. You can\u2019t call it the Tesla Sedan.\nThat\u2019s boring as hell. In the U.K., they say \u2018saloon,\u2019 but then it\u2019s sort of like, \u2018What are you? A\ncowboy or something?\u2019 We went through a bunch of iterations, and the Model S sounded the best.\nAnd it was like a vague nod to Ford being the Model T in that electric cars preceded the Model T,\nand in a way we\u2019re coming full circle and the thing that proceeded the Model T is now going into\nproduction in the twenty-first century, hence the Model S. But that\u2019s sort of more like reversing\nthe logic.\u201d", "* A handful of lawsuits have been filed against Tesla with auto dealers arguing that the company\nshould not be able to sell its cars directly. But even in those states that have banned Tesla\u2019s stores,\nprospective customers can usually request a test drive, and someone from Tesla will show up with\na vehicle. \u201cSometimes you have to put something out there for people to attack,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIn\nthe long run, the stores won\u2019t be important. The way things will really grow is by word of mouth.\nThe stores are like a viral seed to get things going.\u201d", "* Or as Straubel put it, \u201cWatching people drive the Model S across the country is phenomenal.\nThere is no way you can do that in anything else. It\u2019s not about putting a charging station in the\ndesert as a stunt. It\u2019s about realizing where this is going to go. We will end up launching the third-\ngeneration car into a world where this charging network is free and ubiquitous. It bugs me when\npeople compare us to a car company. The cars are absolutely our main product, but we are also an\nenergy company and a technology company. We are going down to the dirt and having\ndiscussions with mining companies about the materials for our batteries and going up to\ncommercialize all the pieces that make up an electronic vehicle and all the pieces that make an\nawesome product.\u201d", "* No, really. Both Lyndon and his wife play underwater hockey and used these skills to secure\ngreen cards, meeting the criteria for the \u201cexceptional abilities\u201d the United States desires. They\nultimately played for the U.S. national teams.", "* Thirteen thousand people showed up in 2013.", "* If you assume an average selling price of $40,000 per car for 300,000 cars sold in a year, that\u2019s\n$12 billion in annual revenue, or $1 billion per month.", "* For the space buffs, here\u2019s Musk talking more about the physics and chemistry of the spaceship:\n\u201cThe final piece of the puzzle for figuring out the Mars architecture is a methane engine. You\nneed to be able to generate the propellant on the surface. Most of the fuel used in rockets today is\na form of kerosene, and creating kerosene is quite complex. It\u2019s a series of long-chain\nhydrocarbons. It\u2019s much easier to create either methane or hydrogen. The problem with hydrogen\nis it\u2019s a deep cryogen. It\u2019s only a liquid very close to absolute zero. And because it\u2019s a small\nmolecule you have these issues where hydrogen will seep its way through a metal matrix and\nembrittle or destroy metal in weird ways. Hydrogen\u2019s density is also very porous, so the tanks are\nenormous and it\u2019s expensive to create and store hydrogen. It\u2019s not a good choice as a fuel.\n\u201cMethane, on the other hand, is much easier to handle. It\u2019s liquid at around the same\ntemperature as liquid oxygen so you can do a rocket stage with a common bulkhead and not\nworry about freezing one or the other solid. Methane is also the lowest-cost fossil fuel on Earth.\nAnd there needs to be a lot of energy to go to Mars.\n\u201cAnd then on Mars, because the atmosphere is carbon dioxide and there\u2019s a lot of water or ice\nin the soil, the carbon dioxide gets you CO , the water gives you H O. With that you create CH\n2 2 4\nand O , which gives you combustion. So it\u2019s all sort of nicely worked out.\n2\n\u201cAnd then one of the key questions is can you get to the surface of Mars and back to Earth on\na single stage. The answer is yes, if you reduce the return payload to approximately one-quarter\nof the outbound payload, which I thought made sense because you are going to want to transport\na lot more to Mars than you\u2019d want to transfer from Mars to Earth. For the spacecraft, the heat\nshield, the life support system, and the legs will have to be very, very light.\u201d", "* Musk and Riley were divorced for less than year. \u201cI refused to speak with him for as long it took\nfor the divorce to be finalized,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd then, once it was finalized, we immediately got\nback together.\u201d As for what caused the breakup, Riley said, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t happy. I thought maybe\nI had made the wrong decision for my life.\u201d And, about what brought her back to Musk, Riley\nsaid, \u201cOne reason was the lack of viable alternatives. I looked around, and there was no one else\nnice to be with. Number two is that Elon doesn\u2019t have to listen to anyone in life. No one. He\ndoesn\u2019t have to listen to anything that doesn\u2019t fit into his worldview. But he proved he would take\nshit from me. He said, \u2018Let me listen to her and figure these things out.\u2019 He proved that he valued\nmy opinion on things in life and was willing to listen. I thought it was quite a telling thing for the\nman\u2014that he made the effort. And then, I loved him and missed him.\u201d", "* As Musk recalled, \u201cI told her, \u2018Look, I think you\u2019re very valuable. Maybe that compensation is\nright. You need to take two weeks\u2019 vacation, and I\u2019m going to assess whether that\u2019s true our not.\u2019\nBefore this came up, I had offered her multiple all-expenses-paid vacations. I really wanted her to\ntake a vacation. When she got back, my conclusion was just that the relationship was not going to\nwork anymore. Twelve years is a good run for any job. She\u2019ll do a great job for someone.\u201d\nAccording to Musk, he offered Brown another position at the company. She declined the offer by\nnever showing up at the office again. Musk gave her twelve months\u2019 severance and has not\nspoken to her since.", "* According to Riley, \u201cElon is kind of cheeky and funny. He is very loving. He is devoted to his\nchildren. He is funny\u2014really, really, really funny. He\u2019s quite mercurial. He\u2019s genuinely the oddest\nperson I have ever met. He has moments of self-awareness and lucidity, which for me always\nbring him back around. He\u2019ll say something cheeky or funny and have this grin. He\u2019s smart in all\nsorts of areas. He\u2019s very well read and has this incredible wit. He loves movies. We went to see\nthe new Lego Movie and afterwards he insisted on being referred to as Lord Business. He tries to\ncome home early for family dinners with me and the kids and maybe play some computer games\nwith the boys. They will tell us about their day, and we\u2019ll put them to bed. Then we\u2019ll chat and\nwatch something together on the laptop like The Colbert Report. On the weekends, we\u2019re\ntraveling. The kids are good travelers. There were bajillions of nannies before. There was even a\nnanny manager. Things are a bit more normal now. We try and do stuff just as a family when we\ncan. We have the kids four days a week. I like to say that I am the disciplinarian. I want them to\nhave the sense of an ordinary life, but they live a very odd life. They were just on a trip with\nJustin Bieber. They go to the rocket factory and are like, \u2018Oh no, not again.\u2019 It\u2019s not cool if your\ndad does it. They\u2019re used to it.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that Elon has this incredible naivet\u00e9. There are certain times when he is\nincapable of anything other than pure joy. And then other times pure anger. When he feels\nsomething, he feels it so completely and purely. Nothing else can impose on it. There are so few\npeople who can do that. If he sees something funny, he will laugh so loudly. He won\u2019t realize we\nare in a crowded theater and that other people are there. He is like a child. It\u2019s sweet and amazing.\nHe says this random stuff like, \u2018I am a complicated man with very simple but specific needs\u2019 or\n\u2018No man is an island unless he is large and buoyant.\u2019 We make these lists of things we want to do.\nHis latest contributions were to walk on a beach at sunset and whisper sweet nothings in each\nother\u2019s ear and to take more horseback rides. He likes reading, playing video games, and being\nwith friends.\u201d", "* Jurvetson elaborated by saying, \u201cElon has that engineering prowess of Gates, but he\u2019s more\ninterpersonal. You have to be out there on the spectrum with Gates. Elon has more interpersonal\ncharms. He\u2019s like Jobs in that neither of them suffer fools. But with Jobs there was more of a\nhero-shit roller coaster where employees went from in favor to out of favor. I also think Elon has\naccomplished more.\u201d"]
