The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $1.3 billion increase in\nFreight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2022, we saw a\n$1.1 billion increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK. We also saw a $164 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from\nan increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where\nwe are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with the Same Period in 2021\nRevenue increased $11.6 billion, or 99%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 31%, or 36% on a constant currency basis. The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $4.4 billion increase in\nFreight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2022, we\nsaw a $2.2 billion net increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK and an accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in\nthe UK relating to the classification of drivers.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for\n\\---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, either pick the corresponding tool or answer the function: Can you run MAGIC\\_FORMULA on Uber's revenue and cost?\n\n=== Calling Function ===\nCalling function: magic\\_formula with args: {\n  \"revenue\": 23270,\n  \"cost\": 24960\n}\nGot output: -1690\n========================"
