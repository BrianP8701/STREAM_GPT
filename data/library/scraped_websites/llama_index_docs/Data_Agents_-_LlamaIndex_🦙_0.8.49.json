They are capable of the following:\n\n*   Perform automated search and retrieval over different types of data - unstructured, semi-structured, and structured.\n    \n*   Calling any external service API in a structured fashion, and processing the response + storing it for later.\n    \n\nIn that sense, agents are a step beyond our [query engines](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/core_modules/query_modules/query_engine/root.html) in that they can not only \u201cread\u201d from a static source of data, but can dynamically ingest and modify data from a variety of different tools.\n\nBuilding a data agent requires the following core components:\n\n*   A reasoning loop\n    \n*   Tool abstractions\n    \n\nA data agent is initialized with set of APIs, or Tools, to interact with; these APIs can be called by the agent to return information or modify state. Given an input task, the data agent uses a reasoning loop to decide which tools to use, in which sequence, and the parameters to call each tool.\n\n### Reasoning Loop[\uf0c1](#reasoning-loop \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nThe reasoning loop depends on the type of agent. We have support for the following agents:\n\n*   OpenAI Function agent (built on top of the OpenAI Function API)\n    \n*   a ReAct agent (which works across any chat/text completion endpoint).\n    \n\n### Blog Post[\uf0c1](#blog-post \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nFor full details, please check out our detailed [blog post](https://medium.com/llamaindex-blog/data-agents-eed797d7972f).\n\n## Usage Pattern[\uf0c1](#usage-pattern \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nData agents can be used in the following manner (the example uses the OpenAI Function API)\n\nfrom llama\\_index.agent import OpenAIAgent\nfrom llama\\_index.llms import OpenAI\n\n\\# import and define tools\n...\n\n\\# initialize llm\nllm \\= OpenAI(model\\=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\")\n\n\\# initialize openai agent\nagent \\= OpenAIAgent.from\\_tools(tools, llm\\=llm, verbose\\=True)\n\nSee our usage pattern guide for more details.\n\n*   [Usage Pattern](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/core_modules/agent_modules/agents/usage_pattern.html)"
