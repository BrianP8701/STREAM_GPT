Later, they started programming on a TRS-80 microcomputer that their father bought, creating simple games, a program to predict the flight of their model rockets, and a word processor. Despite their interest in programming, they initially planned to study philosophy in college, but eventually switched to AI.\n\n## 3\\.

New York City is a global cultural, financial, and media center with \n    a significant influence on commerce, health care and life sciences, entertainment, \n    research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. \n    Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, \n    New York is an important center for international diplomacy,\n    an established safe haven for global investors, and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.\n\"\"\"\nessay\\_index\\_summary \\= \"\"\"\n    Author: Paul Graham. \n    The author grew up painting and writing essays. \n    He wrote a book on Lisp and did freelance Lisp hacking work to support himself. \n    He also became the de facto studio assistant for Idelle Weber, an early photorealist painter. \n    He eventually had the idea to start a company to put art galleries online, but the idea was unsuccessful. \n    He then had the idea to write software to build online stores, which became the basis for his successful company, Viaweb. \n    After Viaweb was acquired by Yahoo!, the author returned to painting and started writing essays online. \n    He wrote a book of essays, Hackers & Painters, and worked on spam filters. \n    He also bought a building in Cambridge to use as an office. \n    He then had the idea to start Y Combinator, an investment firm that would \n    make a larger number of smaller investments and help founders remain as CEO. \n    He and his partner Jessica Livingston ran Y Combinator and funded a batch of startups twice a year. \n    He also continued to write essays, cook for groups of friends, and explore the concept of invented vs discovered in software. \n\"\"\"\n\nfrom llama\\_index import StorageContext, load\\_graph\\_from\\_storage\n\ngraph \\= ComposableGraph.from\\_indices(\n    GPTSimpleKeywordTableIndex,\n    \\[nyc\\_index, essay\\_index\\],\n    index\\_summaries\\=\\[nyc\\_index\\_summary, essay\\_index\\_summary\\],\n    max\\_keywords\\_per\\_chunk\\=50,\n    service\\_context\\=service\\_context,\n    storage\\_context\\=storage\\_context,\n)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\nTrace: graph\\_construction\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n### 3.2 Query[\uf0c1](#query \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nquery\\_engine \\= graph.as\\_query\\_engine()\n\nresponse \\= query\\_engine.query(\n    \"What is the climate of New York City like?

The city enjoys an average of 234 days of sunshine each year. During winter, the city is chilly and damp, with influences from the Atlantic Ocean and the Appalachian Mountains helping to keep it warmer than other inland cities at similar latitudes. The average daily temperature in January, which is the coldest month, is 33.3 \u00b0F (0.7 \u00b0C). However, temperatures can fluctuate significantly, dropping to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) on some days, and reaching up to 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) on others, even in the coldest winter month.\n\n## View HoneyHive Traces[\uf0c1](#view-honeyhive-traces \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nWhen we are done tracing our events we can view them via [the HoneyHive platform](https://app.honeyhive.ai/).
