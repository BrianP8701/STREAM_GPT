It can make use of Retrievers and Response Synthesizer modules under the hood.\n    \n*   **Chat Engines**: This class enables conversation over a knowledge base. It is the stateful version of a query engine that keeps track of conversation history.\n    \n\n## Additional Query Classes[\uf0c1](#additional-query-classes \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nWe also detail some additional query classes below.\n\n*   **Query Bundle**: This is the input to the query classes: retriever, response synthesizer,\n    \n    and query engine. It enables the user to customize the string(s) used for embedding-based query.\n    \n*   **Query Transform**: This class augments a raw query string with\n    \n    associated transformations to improve index querying. Can be used with a Retriever (see TransformRetriever) or QueryEngine."
