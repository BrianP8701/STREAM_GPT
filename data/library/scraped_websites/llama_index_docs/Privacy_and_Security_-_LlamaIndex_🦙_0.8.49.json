However, it is important to note that this can be configured according to your preferences. LLamaIndex provides the flexibility to use your own embedding model or run a large language model locally if desired.\n\n## Data Privacy[\uf0c1](#data-privacy \"Permalink to this heading\")\n\nRegarding data privacy, when using LLamaIndex with OpenAI, the privacy details and handling of your data are subject to OpenAI\u2019s policies.
